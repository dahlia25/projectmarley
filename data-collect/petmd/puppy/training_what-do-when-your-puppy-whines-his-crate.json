They pounce around with their big, clumsy paws, snooze in all sorts of weird positions and unknowingly pose for the cutest pictures. But, puppies require diligent training in order to grow into well-behaved adult dogs. And crate training puppies is often necessary to keep these young canines safe and out of trouble. However, if you\u2019ve tried crate training a puppy, you know it\u2019s not easy. One of the most frustrating\u2014and heartbreaking\u2014parts of crate training is when a puppy whines in his crate. It\u2019s important to take the right steps in order to minimize stress and frustration for both you and your puppy. That means training your puppy to feel at ease and comfortable in his crate. Why Do Puppies Whine in Their Crates? Puppies whining in their crates is normal behavior, says Linda Campbell, RVT, VTS, shelter animal behavior manager at the Humane Society of Missouri. \u201cDogs new to being crated may whine or cry because they are not accustomed to the confinement,\u201d she says. \u201cPuppies, recently separated from their littermates, are often confused and lonely and will vocalize.\u201d\u00a0 Dr. Jennifer Coates, a veterinarian based in Fort Collins, Colorado, agrees that isolation and loneliness is often the culprit and reason for why puppies cry in their crates. \u201cDogs, and especially puppies, are social and want nothing more than to be with their \u2018pack,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not too surprising that they would try to get your attention when they feel isolated.\u201d How to Get a Puppy to Stop Whining in His Crate While pet parents may not be able to completely curb whining behavior in puppies, there are ways to minimize it. It\u2019s important to practice proper crate training and to avoid teaching your puppy bad habits early on. Here are some steps you can take to help cut down on your puppy whining in his crate. Ignore the whining behavior. One of the biggest mistakes that new pet parents make is giving their puppies attention or taking their puppies out of the crate once the whining begins. \u201cIgnoring the whining is your best option,\u201d says Dr. Coates. \u201cAny type of attention will just reinforce the behavior.\u201d Campbell says that pet parents should avoid giving attention or taking a puppy out of the crate until he is quiet. \u201cThe goal is to teach the puppy that quiet, calm behavior results in a release,\u201d she says. \u201cThe puppy can be released after waking up from his nap or after a few minutes of quiet behavior.\u201d Pick the right-size crate. Puppies should have enough space in their crates to help them stay comfortable. \u201cThe crate must be large enough that the pet can stand up, turn around and play with toys,\u201d says Campbell. Consider dog crates\u00a0that have a divider that you can use to adjust the size of the crate as your puppy grows, like the Frisco fold and carry single door collapsable wire door crate.\u00a0 Get your puppy comfortable with the crate. Familiarizing your puppy with his crate is one way to help cut down on anxiety and reduce whining. \u201cThe first rule is to take your time acclimating your puppy to the crate,\u201d says Victoria Schade, a professional dog trainer and author of \u201cLife on the Leash.\u201d \u201cYour pup needs the opportunity to learn that the crate is a comfortable and happy space, and if you start crating without an adequate \u2018getting to know you\u2019 period, your puppy will be more likely to protest.\u201d Never use your puppy\u2019s crate as punishment, adds Campbell. \u201cProviding treats, chew toys and bedding in the crate will help with the experience,\u201d she says. Use dog treats\u00a0to reward your puppy when he is being quiet and calm in his crate. \u201cOnce accustomed to the crate, most dogs will enter it readily on their own,\u201d says Campbell, who suggests leaving the crate door open when it\u2019s not in use. \u201cIt becomes their safe haven to enjoy time chewing on toys, relaxing and watching their families,\u201d she adds. \u00a0 Make sure to provide plenty of potty breaks. Puppies cannot \u201chold it\u201d for as long as adult dogs, so it\u2019s a pet parent\u2019s responsibility to make sure that young puppies have ample opportunities to go outside\u2014even in the middle of the night. \u201cKennel soiling is often caused by leaving the puppy longer than he can control himself,\u201d says Campbell. She explains that figuring out the number of hours a puppy needs between bathroom breaks is by adding his age plus one. So, a 2-month-old puppy can usually hold it for three hours, and a 3-month-old puppy can generally hold it for four hours. Schade says that it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry and to use your puppy\u2019s age as a good estimate for how long he can go between bathroom breaks. \u201cThere&#039;s no such thing as too many trips outside when a pup is potty training,\u201d she says. Make sure to consider crate placement. Where you have your puppy\u2019s crate located may be a factor in whether or not he whines. \u201cCrate placement can definitely impact a dog&#039;s reaction to it,\u201d says Schade. \u201cIf the crate is put in a faraway room, or worse yet, the garage or basement, the puppy might feel too isolated and react by crying.\u201d Campbell recommends keeping the crate in an area where the family spends a lot of time. She even says that some pet parents decide to use two crates\u2014one in a family room or living room and another for the bedroom where the puppy will sleep. In addition to helping your puppy feel less anxious, keeping the crate close will allow you to hear when your puppy needs to go outside. \u201cMost young puppies can&#039;t hold it for the entire night, so pet parents must be able to hear when the puppy wakes and cries to go out,\u201d says Schade. \u201cIf not, the puppy might be forced to soil the crate.\u201d Give your puppy plenty of exercise. To stop your puppy from whining in the crate, don\u2019t underestimate the power of playtime. \u201cMake sure your puppy is getting lots of exercise and attention outside of the crate,\u201d says Dr. Coates. \u201cIf this is the case, chances are good that your pup will be ready for a nap when crated.\u201d Schade suggests adding interactive or dog treat toys\u00a0to your puppy\u2019s crate to help keep your puppy busy and reduce boredom. \u201cGive your dog a safe, hard, rubber busy toy stuffed with a little peanut butter or a few treats whenever you crate him,\u201d she says. \u201cWith consistency, this delicious ritual might help your puppy get excited to go into the crate.\u201d Pet parents can try a KONG puppy dog toy, but Schade recommends testing toys with your puppy prior to giving them to him to make sure he can&#039;t rip pieces off. Puppy Crying in His Crate: When to Worry While puppy whining is not uncommon, pet parents should be on the lookout for any excessive whining or unusual behavior\u2014whether a puppy is crated or not. \u201cTalk to your veterinarian if whining is a new behavior for a dog who has previously handled being crated well or if you notice any other worrisome symptoms,\u201d says Dr. Coates. Schade agrees that pet parents should stay alert and reach out for help if puppy crying doesn\u2019t subside. \u201cA little bit of puppy whining in the crate is to be expected,\u201d she says. \u201cIf a puppy is reactive the entire time he is crated\u2014no matter the duration\u2014or self-injures in an attempt to escape, it&#039;s important to connect with a trainer or veterinary behaviorist.\u201d By Deidre Grieves Featured Image: iStock.com/cmannphoto"}]
