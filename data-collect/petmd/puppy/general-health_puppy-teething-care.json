Puppy teething can be painful, so it&#039;s important to learn how to care for teething puppies.", "articleBody": "In humans, teething happens when baby teeth erupt, or push through the gums. But when it comes to dogs, teething is associated with the adult teeth growing in. The process can be painful. Teething babies are known to be fussy, interested in chewing, and can even have a mild fever during this phase. Puppies go through similar discomfort, so it\u2019s important that pet parents keep their fur baby comfortable as their permanent teeth erupt. Here\u2019s what to know about taking care of a teething puppy. When Do Puppies Start Teething?  Puppies are born toothless, but their baby teeth begin to erupt at 3 weeks old. By 8 weeks, they have their full set of 28 baby (deciduous) teeth. Those teeth fall out when puppies are between 4-7 months old and are replaced by 42 adult teeth.\u00a0 Teething starts when the adult teeth move within the jaw and begin to put pressure on the roots of the baby teeth.\u00a0Puppies stop teething\u00a0when the adult teeth are fully erupted, at 6-7 months old. Large-breed dogs typically erupt adult teeth sooner than small breed dogs, but the process to complete eruption can take longer for big dogs.\u00a0 4 Tips for Helping a Teething Puppy  1. Puppy-Proof Your Home\u00a0 Puppy-proofing your home\u00a0is about taking away anything you don\u2019t want destroyed and offering plenty of appropriate items your pup can chew on.\u00a0 Make sure dangerous items like medications, trash, batteries, gum,\u00a0cleaning supplies, and food are out of your puppy\u2019s reach. If you have indoor or outdoor plants, ensure they aren\u2019t\u00a0toxic to dogs.\u00a0Move electric cords away from curious puppies, and use\u00a0dog gates\u00a0to block stairs and any other space where you don\u2019t want your puppy to venture.\u00a0 Inside the puppy\u2019s space,\u00a0place a crate\u00a0where they can feel secure. Make sure they have a\u00a0water bowl,\u00a0soft bedding, and space inside to sit, lie down, stand, and turn around.\u00a0 2. Buy Puppy Teething Toys\u00a0 Toys are a great outlet for keeping a puppy entertained and helping them deal with teething pain. Keep lots of puppy-safe toys around, and rotate what toys are available to your pup to keep them interested.\u00a0 For teething puppies, offer a mix of rubber toys and soft toys. Stay away from very hard toys or bones (ones that are so hard you can\u2019t indent them with your fingernail), as these can lead to broken teeth. Some of the best puppy teething toys include:\u00a0 Classic KONG toy\u00a0 KONG Puppy Binkie\u00a0 Petstages Cool Teething Stick\u00a0 ChuckIt! Rubber Ball\u00a0 PetSafe Busy Buddy Bristle Bone Treat Dispenser\u00a0 3. Try Frozen Goodies\u00a0 Frozen toys and treats help soothe a teething puppy\u2019s gums, and they\u2019re a great way to enrich your puppy\u2019s playtime. Try filling a KONG toy with puppy food mixed with water and placing it in the freezer. This is also a helpful tool when\u00a0crate training, to provide your puppy a yummy distraction when you leave them alone.\u00a0 Chilled or frozen snacks such as\u00a0green beans,\u00a0blueberries,\u00a0seedless watermelon, or\u00a0carrots\u00a0are a good dog-friendly option that can also feel good on sore gums. Ice cubes are very hard on teeth and not recommended for your puppy.\u00a0 4. Practice Soft-Mouth Training\u00a0 Puppies can be extra mouthy during teething, and they need their pet parents to teach them what\u00a0isn\u2019t\u00a0a chew toy.\u00a0 If your puppy gets mouthy while playing, immediately offer them a toy or chew item. If this doesn\u2019t work, pull your hands away, separate yourself from your puppy quietly, and avoid eye contact. This teaches them that mouthing or biting doesn\u2019t get them more attention. When they calm down, you can resume playing with a toy.\u00a0 Use positive reinforcement training\u2014giving your pup attention, praise, and food when they do the right thing\u2014to teach desired behaviors and help your puppy learn. Positive reinforcement is the best way to train dogs, because it creates a strong bond without fear and anxiety. If your puppy is showing aggression over toys or is persistently mouthy, talk to your veterinarian.\u00a0 Featured Image: iStock/Sergeeva\u00a0"}]
