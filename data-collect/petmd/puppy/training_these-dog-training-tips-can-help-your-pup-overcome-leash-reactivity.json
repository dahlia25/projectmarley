Leash-reactive dogs are triggered by stimuli in the environment, responding with over-the-top behaviors that increase stress levels for the pet parent, the dog and everyone within barking distance. Fortunately, there are straightforward, dog-friendly techniques for dealing with leash reactivity that can help bring peace back to your daily strolls. \u00a0 Is It Leash Aggression or Something Else? Leash \u201creactivity\u201d is a catchall descriptor for behaviors that can range from fear to frustration to true aggression. A dog that barks, jumps, lunges and growls while on a dog leash might seem like he wants to rumble with whatever it is that\u2019s triggering him, but many dogs exhibit those types of reactions in an effort to increase their distance from the triggering stimulus. Reactivity can look like aggression, but many leash-reactive dogs are dealing with anxiety or fear, and they use the explosive displays in an attempt to keep away from the stimulus. It\u2019s a defensive strategy used by fearful dogs to prevent further confrontations. In some cases, dogs that are overaroused on leash are actually frustrated because they\u2019re unable to interact with other dogs they encounter. These dogs are perfectly appropriate when they have the opportunity to greet other dogs off leash, but resort to barky displays when they\u2019re prevented from engaging in normal social behaviors like moving freely around one another and sniffing. If a dog has a history of inappropriate behavior or fighting with other dogs, it\u2019s possible that leash reactivity is rooted in true aggression. \u00a0 What Causes Leash Reactivity? Leash reactivity might stem from any of the following reasons or from a combination of them: \u00a0 Lack of Early Socialization Dogs who miss the opportunity to explore the world, meet new people and animals, and have a variety of positive experiences during puppyhood might be more likely to exhibit leash reactivity. This is because they\u2019re unsure of how to process new situations. \u00a0 Having a Bad Experience During a Walk If a dog has a negative run-in with another dog or is frightened by something during a walk, like a speeding truck, over time, he might generalize that experience to all dogs or trucks he encounters. \u00a0 Being Punished for Reacting Dogs that have been \u201ccorrected\u201d for reacting to a trigger during walks with aversive equipment, like a choke collar, might make the connection between pain and the presence of the trigger, and react preemptively. \u00a0 Barrier Frustration Some dogs want to interact with other dogs during walks and bark or jump when they\u2019re unable to. Also, if the leash tightens and they\u2019re moved away from the other dog before they\u2019re ready to disengage, that can cause them to become reactive as well. \u00a0 Dealing with Leash Reactivity Using Gentle Dog Training Methods The core of rehabbing a leash-reactive dog is changing your dog\u2019s perception of the stressor. Instead of feeling unsure or threatened, your dog will learn to have a more positive association to the stimulus. To get started, you\u2019ll need high-value treats like tiny bits of chicken, and a \u201cmarker\u201d\u2014either a dog clicker or a short verbal marker like the word \u201cyup.\u201d The clicker is particularly effective in leash reactivity scenarios because the clear sound cuts through ambient noise. \u00a0 Set the Buffer Zone First, determine your dog\u2019s \u201cbuffer zone,\u201d or the distance at which your dog can see the stimulus but not react to it. This step is important, because if you accidentally get too close to the trigger, your dog will likely tip over into reactivity and won\u2019t be able to process the training. Your goal is to always keep your dog \u201csub-threshold,\u201d or below the point where he reacts to the trigger, even if that means ducking behind cars or walking up a driveway to maintain the buffer. If your dog is unable to focus on you and refuses the high-value dog treats, you\u2019re probably too close to the trigger. \u00a0 Associate Treats With the Trigger The training plan is simple: mark the moment your dog sees the trigger at a distance with a click or \u201cyup,\u201d then immediately give your dog a treat. Continue this process, maintaining the buffer zone and marking and rewarding your dog frequently, until the trigger is out of sight. Remember, you\u2019re making an association between the appearance of the trigger and the delicious teats, so repeat this process every time you encounter the stressor, for as long as it\u2019s visible. If you\u2019re consistent, your dog will soon figure out that the appearance of the trigger means that something good is going to happen, and will probably look at you the second he sees the stressor on the horizon. This is a positive step\u2014it means that your dog has started to make the association between the scary thing and the food. \u00a0 Decrease the Distance From the Trigger At this point, you can slowly begin to decrease the distance between your dog and the trigger during walks, always making sure that your dog is relaxed and still able to eat treats as you get closer. Keep in mind, if you notice that your dog has trouble looking away from the trigger or refuses dog treats, you might be pushing too hard. Walking a leash-reactive dog can be embarrassing, and your dog might end up being labeled a menace, even if he\u2019s reacting out of fear or frustration. But by understanding your dog\u2019s buffer zone and increasing his confidence using gentle dog training methods, in time, he might become the neighborhood welcoming committee.\u00a0"}]
