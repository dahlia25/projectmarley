Here are five vet-approved ways to make your puppy&#039;s first night home a success.", "articleBody": "Bringing home a new four-legged family member is such an exciting time, but it can also be overwhelming\u2014especially for your new puppy. Not only is your pup in a new home with new humans and possibly new animal friends, but this may also be your pup\u2019s first night away from his family, so he may need a little extra TLC.\u00a0 But if you know what to expect, there are several things you can do to make your puppy\u2019s first night at home more comfortable.\u00a0 Make the Crate a Safe Space  Crate training\u00a0is recommended for all puppies, but especially on a puppy\u2019s first night home. When dogs are nervous, they tend to seek out small spaces to create a protective shelter for themselves. Crates are a great way to provide that safe haven for them. Later in life, many dogs will continue to use their crate as their safe space if they\u2019re ever\u00a0feeling overwhelmed or anxious. Crates are also a helpful tool for\u00a0housetraining your puppy,\u00a0as dogs don\u2019t like to soil the area they sleep in.\u00a0 There are several things you can do to make the crate a safe space for your pup:\u00a0 Feeding meals or treats inside the crate is often seen as a reward and creates a positive association for dogs.\u00a0 Keeping\u00a0dog toys\u00a0in the crate can also provide a similar reward and positive association for pets.\u00a0 Adding a\u00a0dog bed\u00a0or\u00a0blankets\u00a0to the crate can make it even more comfortable (although some dogs do prefer to lie on hard surfaces).\u00a0 Never use the crate as punishment, as this can ruin your puppy\u2019s feelings of security and make the crate feel like less of a safe space for him.\u00a0 Plan Puppy\u2019s Dinner Right   Establish a feeding schedule\u00a0when you bring home your puppy: Puppies under 14-18 weeks old should be fed three meals a day, and these meals should be fed first thing in the morning, around lunchtime, and again at dinnertime. Once they\u2019re older than 18 weeks, their feeding schedule can be decreased to twice daily: morning and evening.\u00a0 In general, a puppy\u2019s dinner should be around 5 p.m., or approximately four hours prior to bedtime. This gives him enough time to digest his food and go to the bathroom one last time before bedtime so (hopefully!) he doesn\u2019t need to be let outside overnight.\u00a0 Whatever feeding schedule you decide to make for your puppy on his first day home, it\u2019s important to keep feeding times consistent going forward, as this can help to make his bowel movements more consistent and aid in housetraining.\u00a0 Schedule Playtime Before Bedtime\u00a0 Playtime before bedtime is ideal for tiring your new puppy out and to help him get a good night\u2019s sleep (and help\u00a0you\u00a0get a good night\u2019s sleep). While there are no hard and fast rules on timing, having playtime in the hours leading up to bedtime can be very helpful.\u00a0 However, it\u2019s important to not overstimulate your puppy just before bedtime. The hour leading up to bedtime should be used to allow your puppy to gradually calm down, which will help him with the transition to bedtime.\u00a0 If you\u2019re planning to put your puppy to bed at 9 p.m., consider having playtime from 7-8 p.m. This gives him from 8-9 p.m. to gradually calm down in time for bed.\u00a0 Some great stimulating activities for puppies include:\u00a0 Training: Dogs love to be trained, and it provides a lot of benefits for them. Training is mentally stimulating and can be as exhausting as physical exercise. It can also help keep them safe, and the more rules dogs know, the more comfortable they tend to feel in a home.\u00a0 Long walks: Walks not only provide dogs with physical exercise, but all the smells are mentally stimulating for them, too. Just\u00a0be sure your puppy is fully vaccinated\u00a0before going for long walks in public places!\u00a0 Playing games: Puppies love to play games like tug of war, hide and seek, scent games, and play with\u00a0puzzle toys.\u00a0 Take a Just-Before-Bed Potty Break\u00a0 Take your puppy out right before bed so that he has one last chance to potty. This should be a short outing, just long enough for him to go to the bathroom. If timed well with dinner, he will hopefully both urinate and defecate during this potty break.\u00a0 Even if you do take him out just before bed, expect to take your puppy out a few times during the night the first few weeks he\u2019s with you. While it\u2019s recommended to take a new puppy to potty every 1.5 hours during the day, overnight they can usually go about 4-6 hours.\u00a0\u00a0 Know That Your Puppy Will Cry It\u2019s very common for puppies to cry their first few nights\u2014or weeks\u2014at home with you. Up until now, they\u2019re used to being surrounded by their mom and siblings all night, every night. When put into this perspective, it\u2019s easy to see how they could be anxious and lonely their first night. So if your puppy\u2019s whining in his crate his first night, this is considered normal; he\u2019s adjusting to his new home and family.\u00a0 Fortunately, there are some things you can do to help your new puppy feel more comfortable in his new home:\u00a0 Putting the crate in your room can help your puppy feel closer to you, while also providing him with the safe space of the crate.\u00a0 Consider putting something in his crate that smells like you, such as a sweatshirt or T-shirt you recently wore, to help make him feel like you\u2019re close.\u00a0 It\u2019s important to distinguish between a puppy\u2019s anxious crate crying versus potty break cries. Typically, anxiety and stress crying occurs early in the night when your puppy is first put into his crate. If he starts crying in the middle of the night, he might need to go to the bathroom.\u00a0 Bringing home a new puppy is a major lifestyle change for both of you. But once the first few nights are through and your bond grows, puppies can be some of the best companions\u2014and their love is worth all the sleepless nights.\u00a0 Featured Image: iStock.com/whitebalance.oatt\u00a0"}]
