You watch as your new best friend voraciously eats his dog food, and surmise his appetite isn\u2019t the problem. Despite your best efforts, however, he\u2019s not gaining weight as he should. Puppies grow at different rates, but if yours is below the average for his breed, there may be an issue. Anything from ineffective feeding methods to underlying diseases can cause slowed growth in puppies, says Dr. Dan Su, a clinical nutrition resident at the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. You may unwittingly be feeding your puppy an insufficient number of calories or a diet that lacks essential nutrients for growth. However, \u201cmedical causes of slowed growth are more common and can include parasites, digestive issues (such as inflammatory bowel disease), a liver shunt, and diabetes, for example,\u201d Su says. Read on to gain insight into why some puppies are resistant to weight gain, as well as what you can do to tip the scale in their favor. Of course, run any changes you plan to make to your puppy\u2019s diet past your veterinarian first. Underlying Causes\u00a0 For pampered pets, the inability to gain weight is rarely due to inadequate food intake, \u201cespecially if the puppy\u2019s appetite seems good,\u201d says Dr. Cailin Heinze, a veterinary nutritionist at Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University in North Grafton, Massachusetts. It\u2019s best to play it safe and bring your puppy to the vet to rule out medical causes. There could be any number of reasons behind her inability to gain weight, but intestinal parasites\u2014particularly roundworms and hookworms\u2014are probably the most common, says Dr. Joe Bartges, professor of medicine and nutrition at the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Georgia in Athens. Inflammatory bowel disease, protein losing enteropathy (any condition of the GI tract resulting in loss of protein), and hypoglycemia are examples of diseases your vet may look for, says Dr. Susan Jeffrey, a veterinarian with Truesdell Animal Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin. Or the problem may be dental-related. \u201cIs there something painful? For example, the puppy\u2019s teeth may not have erupted normally and may be coming into contact with the tongue.\u201d \u00a0 Additionally, certain foods can be too rich for some puppies and result in diarrhea. \u201cThis isn&#039;t necessarily a food allergy, but I think some pups with developing gastrointestinal tracts can&#039;t handle certain foods,\u201d she explains. Is Your Puppy Getting Sufficient Calories? If your vet has ruled out an underlying condition, it\u2019s possible your puppy is not getting the right number of calories. Jeffrey recommends discussing your dog\u2019s diet with a vet, and calculating the recommended daily caloric intake for the puppy, a methodology based on breed, a dog\u2019s activity level, and reproductive status. \u201cSpayed or neutered animals may not need as many calories as intact animals,\u201d she says.\u00a0 Feeding a higher calorie food may be beneficial if the puppy has a poor appetite and isn\u2019t finishing the recommended portion of food, says Heinze, who is board-certified in veterinary nutrition. \u201cBut this should only be attempted after parasites have been checked for and treated and blood work and other diagnostics have been done to rule out health issues.\u201d Examine Your Puppy\u2019s Diet Diets devoid of an essential balance of vitamins, minerals, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates may also be to blame, says Jeffrey, whose professional interests include preventative care. \u201cYou should be feeding your puppy a diet that is AAFCO-approved (complete and balanced) for growth, as well as choosing a diet that is appropriate for the presumed adult size,\u201d Jeffrey explains. \u201cFor example, large and giant breed puppies should eat a diet labeled for large breed puppies.\u201d Despite what you might think, diets formulated for growth aren\u2019t always high quality. \u201cConsider changing the diet to a more well-known diet from a larger pet food company or even feed a therapeutic diet,\u201d advises Bartges, who is board-certified in veterinary internal medicine and veterinary nutrition. A raw food diet isn\u2019t a cure-all, either. \u201cWhile I help people with raw food diets if that is what they want to feed, I discourage pet parents from feeding raw food diets to puppies,\u201d he says. \u00a0\u201cThe margin of safety is narrow during growth\u00a0and this can be an issue not only for nutrient imbalances but also infectious disease.\u201d What to Avoid You may be tempted to add a nutritional supplement to puppy food to encourage growth, but using supplements without consulting a vet can harm your canine companion. For example, \u201cexcess calcium can increase the risk of developmental orthopedic diseases in large breed puppies; excess vitamin D can lead to toxicity,\u201d Su says. Another potential problem to avoid is obesity. \u201cMany puppies that owners deem too thin are at a healthy weight and the owners are trying to make them fat because they don\u2019t have a good understanding of what a healthy puppy looks like,\u201d Heinze says. \u201cUnless the puppy has a known health issue, being slightly \u2018ribby\u2019 is generally healthier than slightly overweight, especially for large and giant breed dogs.\u201d Vets recommend frequent weight checks to ensure your puppy doesn\u2019t become overweight. \u201cAnd if weight gain is faster than desired, calorie adjustments can be made before weight gain becomes excessive,\u201d Su says. In addition to ruling out underlying conditions and ensuring your dog\u2019s diet is balanced and provides the appropriate number of calories, you may want to examine your feeding methods. \u201cSome puppies need several small meals throughout the day instead of two large meals,\u201d Jeffrey says. \u201cFeeding small meals may help with weight gain.\u201d Also look for behavioral clues. \u201cIf the puppy is having to compete to eat with other dogs in the house, the puppy should be fed separately,\u201d she says. \u201cNot only will this help reduce stress, it will allow the owner to determine the exact amount of food the puppy is eating.\u201d"}]
