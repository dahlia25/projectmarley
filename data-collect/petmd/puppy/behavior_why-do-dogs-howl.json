Dr. Tupler explains how dogs use howling to communicate and what to do if your dog\u2019s howling seems more often than usual.", "articleBody": "Dogs are undoubtedly one of the most beloved and highly regarded companion animals. They are known for their loyalty, playfulness, and social nature. One of the distinct behaviors of dogs that fascinates many pet parents is howling. Dogs howl for a variety of reasons, and understanding why dogs howl can help pet parents better communicate with and care for their furry friends. Let\u2019s take a look at how dogs may have come to have this unusual behavior, and what they might use it for. The Origin of Howling in Dogs Domesticated dogs descended from wolves over 15,000 years ago. Even though behaviorally, dogs are no closer to wolves than humans are to primates, their evolutionary development helps us understand some of their unique traits. Wolves howl as a means of communication with other wolves. Howling is used to assemble the pack, coordinate the pack\u2019s hunting activities, establish territories, and warn other groups to stay away. 5 Reasons Domesticated Dogs Howl Communication Like wolves, dogs howl to communicate with other dogs, especially as a way to send a message over a long distance. Howling can also be used as a signal to others about a dog\u2019s presence or location and an invitation to interact. Express Emotions While dogs don\u2019t have the same range of complex emotions as humans do, they may use howling to express an emotional state. When dogs are excited, for example, they may howl to show their excitement. Similarly, dogs may howl when they are upset, stressed, anxious, or lonely. Howling can also be a sign of frustration or boredom. Response to Their Environment Dogs may howl in response to something going on in their environment, such as blaring sirens, loud music, or other dogs howling. This last behavior is known as \u201ccontagious howling\u201d and is common in dogs who live in urban areas, where your dog is more likely to hear the sound of other pups. Territory identification Dogs may howl to announce their territory. By howling, dogs communicate to other dogs that a particular area is theirs and others should stay away. \u00a0Breed-specific behavior Some dog breeds are genetically more likely to howl than others, due to line breeding for particular traits. Beagles, for example, use howling to alert others during hunting and play. Similarly, Huskies and Malamutes howl to communicate with other dogs because that\u2019s the way they were bred for work. If Howling Is Excessive, Seek Veterinary Guidance For better or worse, howling is a natural behavior for many dogs and serves as a means of communication. It\u2019s one of the many fascinating behaviors of dogs that make them unique and lovable pets. If your dog loves to howl more than others, high-value treats can help curb excitement and stress caused from howling. Treats can include longer lasting rawhides, calming chews, or even an\u00a0interactive treat game. It is important to note, however, that excessive howling may be a sign of an underlying medical or behavioral issue. Pet parents who notice what seem like extreme or chronic cases (howling without stopping even for treats, howling while performing other behaviors like biting, or in signs of pain) of howling should seek veterinary care. Paying attention to your dog\u2019s howling behavior and understanding the reasons behind it can help you be a better communicator and pet parent to your pup. Featured Image: iStock.com/dageldog"}]
