Puppy teething can be painful, but here&#039;s what you should know to help your pup.", "articleBody": "Puppies do a lot of growing and changing from birth to their 6-month birthday, and their teeth play a large role in that. Facial sensation and taste are some of the first senses puppies develop, and it\u2019s normal for dogs to explore the world and seek attention with their mouth\u2014especially during teething. Just like with human babies, teething is a normal but sometimes painful process all puppies go through. Teething puppies are more mouthy than usual as their baby teeth fall out and their adult dog teeth replace them. But when does teething start (and when does that mouthiness stop)? Here\u2019s what pet parents need to know about puppy teething. How Many Teeth Do Puppies Have? Puppies are born without teeth; because they\u2019re feeding on their mother\u2019s milk, they don\u2019t need them! But even though they\u2019re initially toothless, their baby teeth and adult teeth are already developing within their jaws at birth. The baby (deciduous) teeth start erupting when puppies are around 3 weeks old. This is also when puppies can start eating solid food in addition to nursing. The incisors (the little teeth in the front of the mouth) and canines (the bigger \u201cfang\u201d teeth) erupt first. The premolars\u2014the teeth used for chewing\u2014follow. Puppies continue to erupt teeth over the next three to five weeks until they\u2019re about 6\u20138 weeks old, when their mouth is filled with 28 pearly white baby teeth. When Do Puppies Stop Teething? Puppy baby teeth don\u2019t last long. Most start to lose their teeth when they\u2019re around 3-and-a-half months old, though some don\u2019t start until they\u2019re 4 or 5 months old. Typically, large- or giant-breed dogs erupt their adult teeth sooner than small dogs. The baby incisors are the first to fall out, and adult teeth push through the gums to take their place. Don\u2019t be shocked when you find a little white tooth on your living room floor\u2014this is completely normal. (But also, don\u2019t worry if you never find any baby teeth, as they are often swallowed.) Puppies continue to lose baby teeth and erupt adult teeth until they\u2019re about 6 months old. The incisors and canines erupt first, at around 3\u20135 months. The premolars follow when a puppy is 4\u20136 months old. The adult molars grow in last, at 5\u20137 months of age. While puppies only have 28 baby teeth, adult dogs have 42 teeth.  Signs of Teething in Puppies It\u2019s normal for puppies to start exploring the world with their mouth (mostly by chewing) when they\u2019re 3\u20137 months old. Because this developmental stage lines up with their teething timeline, it can be difficult to know whether your puppy is gnawing on things because he\u2019s in pain or because he\u2019s just curious. That said, teething pain may cause your puppy to become more mouthy or more destructive at home. This is a temporary period, and puppies need to be redirected to appropriate chewing opportunities, like toys. How To Care for a Teething Puppy Taking care of a teething puppy involves offering lots of options for chewing\u2014particularly soft toys, rubber toys, and chilled or frozen toys. Your puppy may prefer harder or softer items, depending on his teething pain. Cold items can help soothe any pain and inflammation, so try giving your pup chilled or frozen treats, like blueberries, green beans, or carrots. The Best Teething Toys for Puppies To keep your puppy from chewing your furniture, give him a few toys that are great for teething, such as: KONG Puppy Binkie Petstages rubber chew toys Nylabone Puppy Teething X Nylabone Puppy Teething Dinosaur Chew Toy Nylabone Teething Pacifier Another hack: Freeze your puppy\u2019s kibble in a Classic KONG or other puzzle toy. The cold toy will soothe his gums while providing your pup with enrichment. Featured Image: iStock/ti-ja"}]
