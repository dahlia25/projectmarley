Nutramax\u00ae\u2014their parent brand\u2014is a trusted company among veterinarians, thanks to its safety and quality checks to ensure that products are safe and effective for pets. Joint supplements are used for a wide variety of medical conditions, including arthritis, joint disease, and bone fractures, and are recommended for healthy pets as they age. Joint supplements help maintain mobility, decrease pain, reduce inflammation, limit disease progression, and encourage new cartilage growth while preventing the cartilage that is present from breaking down. If you think your pet would benefit from a joint supplement, talk to your veterinarian to find the best product to fit your pet\u2019s specific needs. What Does Cosequin and Dasuquin Do for Cats and Dogs?

This is important, because healthy cartilage is essential to pain-free movement. Chondroitin is a naturally occurring compound found in a pet\u2019s joints\u2014it helps lubricate, provides shock absorption, and nourishes tissue lining the joints.\u00a0 Glucosamine and chondroitin work together to reduce inflammation and help prevent destruction of cartilage in joints. They are safe to give to your pet long-term and are recommended as early treatment in older pets, especially those recently diagnosed with arthritis.

The fish oils in these soft chews are rich in these fatty acids, which have positive effects not only on a pet\u2019s joints but also for the skin, heart, brain, and immune system.\u00a0 MSM (methylsulfonylmethane) is a naturally occurring anti-inflammatory and antioxidant used in some\u00a0Cosequin\u00a0and\u00a0Dasuquin\u00a0products. MSM also helps flush out any toxins in the joint\u2019s cells, making room for healthy vitamins and minerals to be absorbed.\u00a0 Boswellia serrata extract is a resin found in the Boswellia tree and is an ingredient in some\u00a0Cosequin\u00a0products. This all-natural supplement offers anti-inflammatory properties and is most often used for pets with long term chronic conditions like arthritis.\u00a0 Hyaluronic acid (HA) \u00a0is also available\u00a0and helps to provide extra lubrication for the synovial (joint) fluid.
