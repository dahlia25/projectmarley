Find out how to tell if your dog has an allergy to cats and what you can do about it.", "articleBody": "Reviewed for accuracy on May 6, 2019, by Dr. Katie Grzyb, DVM You already know that people can be allergic to cats. Exposure to cat dander creates a host of discomforting symptoms for humans, from sneezing and itchiness to wheezing and coughing. But can your dog be allergic to cats as well? Yes, dogs can actually be allergic to cats, and they can even suffer from many of the same symptoms as allergic humans do. But there are steps you can take to help manage your dog\u2019s allergies so that your pets can happily coexist. Is Your Dog Allergic to Cats? While it\u2019s fairly uncommon for a dog to be allergic to cats, it does happen. \u201cWe include a test for cat dander on our intradermal allergy test,\u201d says Dr. Elizabeth Falk, a board-certified veterinary dermatologist at Cornell University Veterinary Specialists in Stamford, Connecticut. Dr. Falk explains that in her personal experience, \u201cabout 1 in 20 of my patients have a significant positive to cat dander on this test.\u201d A dog that\u2019s allergic to cats will have symptoms that are similar to other environmental allergies, says Dr. Susan Jeffrey, a veterinarian at Truesdell Animal Care Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin. Some of these symptoms include \u201clots of scratching and licking, leading to skin changes, such as redness, excoriations (repetitive scratching) and the development of pustules and/or crusts.\u201d Some dogs may also exhibit respiratory signs, such as coughing, sneezing or watery eyes and nose, says Dr. Kristin Holm, a board-certified veterinary dermatologist with Veterinary Dermatology Consultation Services in Johnston, Iowa. \u201cBut this is not as common as it is in people.\u201d Only your veterinarian can make an official diagnosis. Dr. Holm says that veterinarians first suspect that a dog has allergies based on his history. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like playing detective,\u201d she says. \u201cThen, the allergy can be confirmed through intradermal (skin) allergy testing or serum (blood) testing.\u201d Is Treatment Available for a Dog That\u2019s Allergic to Cats? There are no cures and no way to prevent an animal from developing allergies. The goal is to manage the symptoms, says Dr.\u00a0Jeffrey. Dr. Jeffrey explains, \u201cThere are companies that make \u2018allergy drops\u2019 that are very similar to allergy injections that people with allergies receive. They desensitize the immune system to the allergens over a period of several months.\u201d The desensitization process can take between 6-12 months. Dr. Falk says that veterinarians can tailor allergy vaccines, or \u201callergy drops,\u201d to target specific allergies in dogs and build up their tolerance to the allergen. These treatments, referred to as allergen-specific immunotherapy, are generally quite effective in about 70 percent of dogs with allergies. Oral allergy medicine for dogs\u00a0that works to stop itchiness\u2014including antihistamines and Apoquel\u2014is also available, says Dr. Jeffrey. \u201cIn addition, treatment of any secondary infections with antibiotics and/or antifungals will also help.\u201d How to Help an Allergic Dog at Home There are some things you can try at home to help lessen your dog\u2019s allergic reaction, says Dr. Holm. \u201cThe first is to strengthen the skin barrier from both the inside and the outside. From the inside, we can give higher levels or\u00a0fatty acids, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), through the diet or as a supplement.\u201d \u201cFrom the outside, bathing with shampoos designed to strengthen the skin barrier a few times a week is helpful,\u00a0while also removing allergens from the skin and fur,\u201d says Dr. Holm. Always talk to your veterinarian to determine the best solutions for your specific dog. Wiping pets with a damp cloth after they\u2019ve been exposed to cat dander may also help decrease itching, says Dr. Jeffrey. Preventing Allergic Reactions to Cats in Your Dog The predisposition to developing allergies is largely genetic, says Dr. Holm. However, while it may sound counterintuitive, exposure to the allergen may actually be helpful, says Dr. Falk. \u201cWe used to think that children that grew up in houses with cats were more likely to be allergic to them, but we have discovered that the opposite is true; children that had cats in their households were less likely to develop allergies to cat dander.\u201d While this is unproven, it is likely to be the case with dogs, too, according to Dr. Falk. \u201cHaving a mixed-pet household may decrease the likelihood of developing an allergy to a cat.\u201d With allergen-specific immunotherapy, prescription pet medications\u00a0and over-the-counter products available to manage allergies, you won\u2019t need to find a new home for your kitty or dog. Check with your veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment recommendations. By: Paula Fitzsimmons Featured Image: iStock.com/PeopleImages"}]
