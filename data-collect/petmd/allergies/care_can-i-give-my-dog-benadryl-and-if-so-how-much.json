If so, how much Benadryl should you give your dog?", "articleBody": "NOTE: It\u2019s always best to contact your veterinarian for guidance before administering any medication to your pet, including Benadryl\u00ae. Benadryl\u00ae, also known by its generic name,\u00a0diphenhydramine, is one of the few over-the-counter drugs designed for people that veterinarians may have pet parents administer at home.\u00a0 You might be looking at using Benadryl\u00ae for dogs to keep your pup calm, or maybe your dog was\u00a0stung by an insect\u00a0and is having a mild allergic reaction. But while Benadryl\u00ae is generally well tolerated by dogs and has a wide safety margin, it\u2019s not necessarily the answer to your dog\u2019s issue. For some dogs, giving Benadryl\u00ae to calm them may have the opposite effect and make them\u00a0more anxious. In addition, Benadryl\u00ae should\u00a0not\u00a0be given to animals with certain health conditions or pups taking certain medications.  So, when is Benadryl\u00ae for dogs effective and safe, and when does your dog need a different treatment? Here are a few things you should keep in mind before giving your dog Benadryl\u00ae. What Is Benadryl\u00ae? Benadryl\u00ae is a first-generation antihistamine that prevents H-1 receptors in the body from reacting to histamine. It can also ease nausea and vomiting by inhibiting the chemoreceptor trigger zone (vomiting center) in the brain and reducing the way that the vestibular apparatus (the balance center in the ear) responds to motion. Veterinarians most commonly recommend that pet parents give their dogs Benadryl\u00ae to prevent or treat mild allergic reactions and to reduce nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness or vestibular disease. Can Benadryl\u00ae Be Used for Dog Allergies? Taken orally, Benadryl\u00ae for dogs can help ease mild allergic symptoms to common triggers such as pollen, mold, and house mites, particularly if it\u2019s used in combination with other allergy treatments. Benadryl\u00ae can also be used for mild allergic reactions to insect bites or stings. Oral or injectable Benadryl\u00ae can be used as a pre-treatment for mild allergic vaccine reactions. But if your pet is having an\u00a0acute\u00a0allergic reaction with facial swelling or difficulty breathing, take them straight to the vet. Severe allergic reactions can be life-threatening. Dogs often require aggressive supportive care and treatment with steroids and epinephrine in addition to Benadryl\u00ae.\u00a0 Can Dogs Take Benadryl\u00ae for Anxiety? You might have heard that\u00a0Benadryl\u00ae can be given to dogs to help with travel anxiety\u00a0or dogs that are scared of\u00a0fireworks\u00a0and\u00a0thunderstorms, but it really isn\u2019t very effective. Benadryl\u00ae may make some dogs a little sleepy and less responsive, but it doesn\u2019t do anything for their underlying anxiety. Benadryl\u00ae does has some\u00a0efficacy\u00a0in the prevention of motion sickness in dogs. So, if your dog is anxious because they\u2019re nauseous in the car, it could help. Some dogs and cats actually have the opposite reaction to Benadryl\u00ae, causing hyperactivity instead of sedation. If your dog has anxiety, talk with your veterinarian to determine a course of treatment. It might involve making changes to your dog\u2019s environment, behavioral training, prescription medications, or tools such as\u00a0anxiety vests and pheromones. Is Benadryl\u00ae Safe for Dogs? By and large, Benadryl\u00ae is very well-tolerated in dogs, with few side effects\u00a0and a low risk of overdose when used correctly. But the reason why you still need to check with your veterinarian is because there are safety risks if your dog has certain health conditions or takes certain medications. Some instances in which Benadryl\u00ae should not be used (or should be used with caution) include: Cardiac conditions (cardiovascular disease) Some lung conditions Liver disease Seizure disorders Difficulties urinating Glaucoma Pregnancy In conjunction with certain medications, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and come drugs used to treat fungal infections Side Effects of Benadryl\u00ae for Dogs At normal doses, the most common side effects of Benadryl\u00ae exhibited by dogs include drowsiness and being unsteady on their feet. But if a dog receives too much Benadryl\u00ae, they might exhibit: More pronounced sedation or agitation Severe unsteadiness Disorientation Aggression or other unusual behaviors Slow breathing Vomiting Diarrhea Coma Seizures Call your veterinarian for advice if your dog experiences any worrisome symptoms after taking Benadryl\u00ae. What\u2019s the Benadryl\u00ae Dosage for Dogs? With any medication, the safest way to know the proper dose for your dog is to ask your veterinarian. In addition, many formulations are combined with other potentially dangerous medications, such as Tylenol. Make sure your Benadryl\u00ae tablets contain only diphenhydramine. According to the Merck Veterinary Manual, the standard dose for Benadryl\u00ae is 2\u20134 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, or 0.9\u20131.8 milligrams (mg) of Benadryl\u00ae per pound. Therefore, a simple and practical dose is 1 mg of Benadryl\u00ae per pound of your dog\u2019s weight, given two to three times a day. For example, a 10-pound dog might receive a 10 mg dose in the morning, afternoon, and evening. Your Dog\u2019s Weight Recommended Dosage Maximum Dosage 5 pounds 5 mg 10 mg 10 pounds 10 mg 20 mg 20 pounds 20 mg 40 mg 30 pounds 30 mg 60 mg 40 40 mg 80 mg 50 50 mg 100 mg 75 75 mg 150 mg 100 pounds 100 mg 200 mg There are also different forms of Benadryl\u00ae, including tablets, capsules, liquids, and children\u2019s chewable tablets, all of which can make it difficult to figure out the amount to give your dog. When in doubt, ask your vet! Benadryl\u00ae Tablets and Capsules Benadryl\u00ae tablets are available and contain either 25 mg or 50 mg of diphenhydramine, which would be the appropriate size for a 25-pound or 50-pound dog, respectively. Give more than one tablet or capsule at a time to add up to the appropriate dose for larger dogs. You can split 25 mg tablets in half to fine-tune your dog\u2019s dose. For example, one 50 mg tablet and half of a 25 mg tablet would be appropriate for a dog weighing 60 pounds. Children\u2019s Chewable or Liquid Benadryl\u00ae for Dogs Children\u2019s chewable or liquid Benadryl\u00ae are good options for tiny dogs. A full chewable children\u2019s tablet contains only 12.5 mg of diphenhydramine and can be cut in half for dogs that weigh less than 10 pounds. Children\u2019s liquid Benadryl\u00ae contains only 2.5 mg/ml and may be easier to give to small dogs that resist taking pills. How Often Can You Give Your Dog Benadryl\u00ae? Dogs can be given Benadryl\u00ae every eight to 12 hours (two to three times a day). Are there Alternatives to Giving a Dog Benadryl\u00ae? Diphenhydramine has been around for a long time, and continued research has led to the development of treatments that may be more effective than Benadryl\u00ae.\u00a0 Using several different types of treatment at the same time (medicated shampoos, supplements, and prescription medications, for example) is the best way to manage a dog\u2019s allergies. Prescription anti-anxiety medications for dogs combined with a behavioral modification program will do a much better job than Benadryl\u00ae when it comes to helping dogs with anxiety. Talk to your veterinarian if you have any questions about giving your dog Benadryl\u00ae or other ways to keep them healthy and happy. Featured Image: iStock.com/ILIA KALINKIN"}]
