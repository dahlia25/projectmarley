It may be that she is allergic to his bed.", "articleBody": "\u00a0 If you\u2019re living with a sneezing, itchy dog, her bed may be to blame. Dog beds, especially if not regularly washed and replaced, can be a major source of dust mites, which can trigger your dog\u2019s allergy symptoms. If you suspect that your dog is allergic to something in your home, learn how her bed may be harboring allergens\u2014and more importantly, how choosing the right type of bed can provide relief. Why Your Dog\u2019s Bed May Be Triggering Her Allergies If your dog is allergic to her bed, the filling is likely the culprit. \u201cSome of the contents can cause an allergic reaction, especially if the dog has had the bed for a long period of time. Over time, there can be an increase in house dust mites and even fleas,\u201d says Dr. Mitchell Song, a board-certified veterinary dermatologist with VetMed in Phoenix, Arizona. Dog beds are usually filled with synthetic or latex memory foam. Although both of these are resistant to the growth of house dust mites and molds, they can still be problematic. \u201cIt\u2019s the accumulation of pet skin cells on the surface of the foam and under the fabric covering that allows the growth of house dust mites. While the foam beddings will not facilitate the growth of house dust mites or molds within the foam, they may accumulate on the surface if skin cells and moisture are present,\u201d says Dr. John Gordon, a board-certified veterinary dermatologist with MedVet in Columbus, Ohio. Choose the Right Outer Fabric Dog beds and mats come in a variety of outer fabrics, including suede, shag faux fur, micro suede shearling, cotton, wool and polyester, says Dr. Song. Although the bed\u2019s filling is usually the source of allergens, experts say some fabrics are more likely to trigger your dog\u2019s allergies than others. \u201cManufacturing synthetic fabrics requires certain chemicals and processes. These chemicals, such as flame retardants, are known to be allergenic. Some fabrics also allow the accumulation of dust mites, mold, mildew and bacteria that can exacerbate skin sensitivities,\u201d says Dr. Hyunmin Kim, veterinary staff manager for the ASPCA Community Medicine Department. Fabrics made of 100 percent cotton, hemp or tightly woven microfiber fabric are less likely to cause an allergic reaction, she says. \u201cHemp is a naturally grown crop that is not sprayed with chemicals or pesticides and is particularly resistant to mildew, sun damage and tears.\u201d How a Hypoallergenic Dog Bed Can Help One key feature of hypoallergenic dog beds, like the KOPEKS orthopedic memory foam dog bed, is that they tend to be made of thicker foam (which is also a good source of support for arthritic patients). \u201cA denser foam mattress will be less likely to harbor dust mites, especially if there is a cover that has a weave tight enough to prevent mites from penetrating through. Looser filling and less-dense foam allows more dust and dust mites to reside in it,\u201d says Dr. Kristin Holm, a board-certified veterinary dermatologist with Veterinary Dermatology Consultation Services in Johnston, Iowa. Dr. Kim says some hypoallergenic fabrics are made from a tightly woven microfiber that blocks the passage of allergy-causing dust mite waste. They\u2019re also easy to clean, which she says may help prevent bacterial skin infections in any dog. In general, however, \u201cAny fabric that is easy to clean, not treated with chemicals and easy to keep free of mold, dust, fleas, dander and dust mites is a good choice.\u201d The Importance of Regularly Replacing Your Dog\u2019s Bed If your dog is sneezing and itchy, the dust mite allergen, which Dr. Gordon says is the most common positive environmental allergen in skin allergy-tested patients, may be responsible. \u201cA veterinary university study that evaluated the presence of house dust mites in pet beds found a significant increase in the amount of house dust mite allergen collected in pet beds older than one year.\u201d This was true regardless of how often the beds were cleaned or their type, he says. Taking precautions to reduce your dog\u2019s exposure to house dust mites in the home will help reduce the severity of their allergy symptoms, says Dr. Gordon. \u201cBecause most pet beds will be cleaned less often and dogs do not wash before going to bed, it is reasonable to consider purchasing a pet bed at least annually.\u201d Even if you plan on buying your pup a new dog bed every year, experts recommend opting for beds that can be easily cleaned, like those with machine-washable covers. (Some beds even have inserts that are machine washable.) \u201cWhen the cover is removed completely it is also important that it is completely dry before putting back on the bedding,\u201d advises Dr. Gordon. Experts recommend washing bed covers each week, especially if your dog is allergic to dust mites. If you find yourself asking, \u201cWhy is my dog sneezing and itchy?\u201d with increasing frequency, the solution may be as simple as washing or replacing her bed. Ask your vet if a hypoallergenic dog bed is a good option."}]
