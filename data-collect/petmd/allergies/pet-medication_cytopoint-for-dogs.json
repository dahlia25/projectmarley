This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Cytopoint\u00ae? Cytopoint\u00ae is a prescription injection administered under a dog\u2019s skin by your veterinarian for itching and skin problems. Cytopoint\u00ae is the first and only monoclonal antibody injection that is USDA-approved for use in dogs for relief of itching due to atopic dermatitis\u2014a skin condition caused by environmental allergies (seasonal allergies triggered by pollen, dust, and grass, among others). Cytopoint\u00ae does not cure your dog\u2019s underlying allergic condition but is a symptomatic treatment to help relieve the itching triggered by it. Cytopoint\u00ae is often used in combination with several other allergy management treatments to help improve the health of your dog\u2019s skin. It often takes time and patience, and your veterinarian will determine whether this medication, including which type of medication formula, is right for your pet. Cytopoint\u00ae is available by prescription only and must be administered at a veterinary practice. It is not available for administration at home because your vet\u2019s professional expertise is needed to properly diagnose environmental allergies in your dog, administer the injection, and monitor the safe use of Cytopoint\u00ae. Cytopoint\u00ae is given as an under-the-skin (subcutaneous) injection once every 4-8 weeks, and the dosage is determined by your dog\u2019s weight. Your veterinarian will need to check your dog\u2019s response to Cytopoint\u00ae to help determine how often your dog should receive the injection. Cytopoint\u00ae is approved for dogs only at this time and should not be used in any other species. How Cytopoint\u00ae Works The active ingredient in Cytopoint\u00ae, lokivetmab, is a dog-specific monoclonal antibody, which is a type of protein made in the laboratory that binds to certain targets in the body, just like the antibodies in your dog\u2019s own immune system. Cytopoint\u00ae specifically binds to interleukin-31 (IL-31), which is one of the main chemical messengers involved in sending itch signals to a dog\u2019s brain, triggering symptoms of scratching, licking, and chewing. When the Cytopoint\u00ae antibody binds to IL-31, it blocks the itch signal from reaching a dog\u2019s brain, which provides relief from itching and allows irritated skin to heal. Cytopoint\u00ae Directions Your veterinarian will administer the Cytopoint\u00ae injection under your dog\u2019s skin. After the injection, you will likely observe a lowering of your dog\u2019s itch level daily over the following 4-8 weeks. It is important to follow up with your veterinarian to determine if Cytopoint\u00ae is an effective treatment for your dog and when it is time for your dog\u2019s next injection. Missed a Dose? If you forget to bring your dog in for their injection, please contact your vet. In general, your veterinarian will schedule an appointment for your dog as needed to assess your dog\u2019s response to Cytopoint\u00ae and administer the next treatment. Cytopoint\u00ae Possible Side Effects Cytopoint\u00ae is typically well-tolerated in most dogs. Uncommon side effects that can occur within the first few days after the injection include: Gastrointestinal signs such as vomiting, diarrhea, and loss of appetite Decreased energy level Tenderness or pain at the injection site Limping on the leg where the injection was given Cytopoint\u00ae is safe for most dogs, but in rare instances, some may be hypersensitive to it or develop an allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). Symptoms may include severe grogginess, weakness, collapse, trouble breathing, vomiting, facial swelling, or hives. Human Side Effects Cytopoint\u00ae is not an approved medication for humans. To be safe, do not participate in any way during the injection. Veterinary staff will hold your dog as the vet administers Cytopoint\u00ae. If you accidentally become injected with a pet medication, call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222. Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) Your pet\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of Cytopoint\u00ae Cytopoint\u00ae Overdose Information An overdose of Cytopoint\u00ae is possible. If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian, seek emergency veterinary care, or call an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply.
