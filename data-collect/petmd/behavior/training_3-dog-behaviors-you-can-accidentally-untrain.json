Find out how you might be untraining your pup without knowing it.", "articleBody": "Image via iStock.com/MonikaBatich By Victoria Schade You\u2019ve put in the time at dog training class and diligently practiced your homework, and now you\u2019re convinced that you\u2019re on your way to having a well-behaved best friend. But did you know that some of your daily interactions might be accidentally untraining your dog? It doesn\u2019t take much for the hard work that you\u2019ve put in for it to start to unravel, and it\u2019s usually because we don\u2019t realize how quickly an undesirable dog behavior can take root. For example, petting your dog when he jumps up on you, zoning out during\u00a0leash\u00a0walks, or slipping him something from your plate when he demands it are easily overlooked responses that might lead to dog behavior problems down the road. The key to avoiding untraining is to always remain mindful when interacting with your dog. Think about whether you like the behavior that your dog is offering. If you don\u2019t, consider how you might be accidentally reinforcing it and keeping the behavior alive. And remember, some things your dog considers reinforcing might not make sense to you. You might think that pushing your dog off when he jumps is a viable training strategy, whereas he might think you\u2019re giving him a welcoming pat! The following are some common ways we untrain our dogs, which might lead to dog behavior problems, and advice on how to avoid them. Training Dogs Not to Jump Reacting to a leaping dog is almost reflexive, and that\u2019s exactly how jumping up becomes a habit. Whether it\u2019s scolding a dog to get him to stop, or reaching down to give a few pats before pushing him off, this is one example of untraining that\u2019s almost universal. Leaping on people is rewarding for dogs because it works; your excited dog makes contact with you, and more often than not, he gets acknowledged when he does it. Even angry acknowledgement is enough to keep the behavior alive. The secret to curbing a jumping habit is to teach your dog that he\u2019s invisible unless he has four paws on the floor. Instead of telling your dog to get off or pushing him, turn your body away the second his front feet start to come off the ground. Don\u2019t acknowledge your dog while he\u2019s leaping, and the moment he manages to keep four on the floor, turn back to him and say hello. If he jumps again, repeat the process. Training dogs not to jump, especially if they\u2019ve been doing it for a while, will take time. You can also teach the arm cross sit to help speed the process. Dog Behaviors That Happen Gradually: Leash Pulling This is an untraining process that literally happens a few steps at a time. In training class, you probably learned that your dog\u2019s leash should always be slack, but the reality is that you probably let your dog pull you occasionally, like when you\u2019re in a hurry or when the weather is bad. The problem is that a pulling habit is a mix of muscle memory and your dog realizing that pulling works for him; over time, that\u2019s a potent untraining combination. Dogs can quickly learn that a tight dog leash means forward motion (that\u2019s the muscle memory aspect), so that combined with allowing him to get where he wants to go will change the way your dog walks on a leash over time. To keep your dog from developing a lifelong pulling habit, make sure to remain fully present during leash walks, meaning don\u2019t zone out on your phone. Be aware of the moment when your dog\u2019s leash starts to get tight, and stop walking so that he realizes that a tight leash no longer means forward motion. If your dog\u2019s pulling habit is becoming entrenched, bring dog treats\u00a0with you and revisit the basic lessons you learned in dog training class. Remember, polite leash walking is a \u201cmarathon\u201d behavior that requires ongoing effort until it becomes a habit. Dealing With Begging Dogs It\u2019s natural to want to share goodies with your dog, but doing so can morph from something you do occasionally to something your dog demands every time you have a plate. Dogs quickly learn that your food can also be theirs with the right combination of puppy dog eyes and demand barking, and in no time, this dog problem can turn mealtime into a test of wills. Begging is rewarding for dogs because they get paid with a potent double-reinforcer when they do it\u2014food and your attention. Whether you\u2019re prepping a meal at the counter or sitting at the kitchen table enjoying dinner, if you give your dog an occasional goody, he\u2019s quickly going to associate both of those scenarios with shared food. If your dog is begging for food at every meal, redirect his attention by giving him something to do at mealtimes. Dog treat toys, like the West Paw Zogoflex Tux toy, make your dog work to earn a tasty payoff, which will keep him focused on getting the treat rather than your food. If your dog begs anytime you have food, even if you\u2019re just grabbing a quick snack, avoid giving in, no matter how hard he tries. You\u2019ll likely see the begging behavior get worse before it gets better, but if you don\u2019t give in, your dog will learn that his puppy dog eyes no longer work."}]
