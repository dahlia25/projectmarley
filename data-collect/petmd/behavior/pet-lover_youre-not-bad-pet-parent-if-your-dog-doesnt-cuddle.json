Find out how to read your dog\u2019s behavior and why some dogs may not enjoying cuddling sessions.", "articleBody": "One of the most basic ways that pet parents and dogs connect is through touch. We love the sensation of petting our dogs, and it\u2019s clear that most of them adore it, too. After all, when we stop, we usually get a paw-swat and a \u201cMore, please!\u201d expression. But, it might come as a shock to discover that some dogs don\u2019t like petting. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a soft stroke or a deep-tissue massage\u2014these touch-aversive dogs prefer to skip cuddly physical contact. Living with a hands-off dog can be a difficult because we all want to show our dogs how much we love them. In many cases, when our dogs move to the other side of the couch when we sit down, we tend to wonder, \u201cDoes my dog love me?\u201d and \u201cDoes my dog know I love him?\u201d Well rest assured, your dog isn\u2019t abnormal if she\u2019s not a stereotypically cuddly dog; she\u2019s just a dog that has other ways of showing that she loves you. And the good news is that a few lifestyle tweaks can help your dog learn to appreciate pats and cuddles and maybe even ask for them! What Causes a No-Cuddle Dog? It\u2019s easy to assume that every dog enjoys petting, but there are a number of reasons why a dog might not appreciate cuddling, including: Previous abuse: The sad fact is that an anti-cuddling dog could have been mishandled in the past. Dogs that have been treated roughly, spanked or physically disciplined due to outdated training techniques might end up being terrified of what human hands are capable of. Pain: Dogs with undiagnosed pain or injuries are likely to be wary of touch. Older dogs dealing with joint issues, athletic dogs coping with strains or sprains, and even puppies going through a growth spurt might avoid petting because it aggravates the pain. A veterinarian can help you determine if your dog is dealing with pain. Wrong technique or body part: Occasionally, petting-aversion could be due to operator error. A small dog might not enjoy rough rubbing on her head and ears, while a bigger dog might find fluttery pats annoying. Similarly, some dogs don\u2019t enjoy having their rear end scratched but are totally fine with shoulder massages instead. \u00a0 Born this way: It\u2019s probably hard to believe that a dog can dislike petting for no other reason than that he just doesn\u2019t enjoy it. Much like some people don\u2019t want hugs, there are dogs that don\u2019t appreciate up-close-and-personal touching. Signs That Dogs Don\u2019t Like Petting Cuddle-averse dogs can show their dislike in obvious ways, like walking away if a person reaches for them or ducking their head as if they\u2019re about to get swatted instead of snuggled. Often, the dislike manifests in ways that are easy to overlook, like a series of behaviors called \u201ccalming signals\u201d that are subtle and happen quickly. For example, if you notice your dog leaning away and licking her lips when you pet her, it\u2019s possible she\u2019s not enjoying it. She might also avoid looking at you or take a few steps away so that you\u2019re not able to touch her with the same intensity. Some dogs even lick the person who\u2019s petting, which is easy to misread as affectionate kissing; however, because many people don\u2019t like slobbery licks, these dogs use the strategy to get people to stop touching them. Can Your Dog Become a Cuddly Dog? With a gentle approach and patience, non-cuddly dogs can learn to appreciate touch and can maybe even learn to love it! But helping your hands-off dog enjoy touch means putting your pup in control. Here are the steps you can take. Follow Your Dog\u2019s Signals for Physical Contact Rather than assuming your dog is enjoying what you\u2019re doing, watch her body language for clues so that you can determine if you\u2019re on the right track. First, reduce all physical contact for a few days other than for necessary behaviors, like putting on the leash. It\u2019s not easy to stop loving up on your dog, but this step is important because it shows your dog that you understand what she\u2019s been telling you. Watch to see if your dog requests physical contact from you during this stage, like brushing up against you or putting her head beneath your hand. If not, continue to withhold casual petting, but remember to find other ways to connect with your dog, like with verbal praise and play. Try a Pet Test and Pay Attention to Your Dog\u2019s Reaction Once you\u2019ve refrained from petting for about a week, try a \u201cpet test,\u201d which is a great way to gauge how any dog, petting-averse or not, is feeling about physical contact in that moment. Give your dog a few gentle rubs on his chest or shoulders for about three seconds, then stop and watch your dog\u2019s reaction. If she wants more, she\u2019ll probably move in closer to you, lean up against you or paw at you. If your dog is still feeling hands-off, she won\u2019t ask for more and will likely just stand there when you stop, or even move away. If your dog signals that she\u2019d like you to continue, try another brief petting session; the key to success is keeping these initial sessions short. Your dog\u2019s acceptance of touch doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s ready for a prolonged full-body massage. Watch your dog\u2019s reactions as you touch her, and try to finish petting before she asks you to stop. Continue to offer your dog brief pats, always paying attention to what she\u2019s telling you as you connect with her. You can vary where you try petting your dog, the type of touch you give her and the duration, as these aspects can all impact her enjoyment of the process. Honoring Your Dog\u2019s Need for Space Keep in mind that even the snuggliest of dogs might not want to be touched all the time. Stressful situations, like a trip to the vet, can make any dog less likely to enjoy touch. Pet parents who take the time to understand what their dog is telling them will know when a petting session is appreciated and when it actually makes their furry best friend uncomfortable. The fact is that even with remedial training, there\u2019s a chance that your dog will never appreciate snuggling up. That doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s anything wrong with your dog or that she loves you any less. Understanding your dog\u2019s likes and dislikes and honoring them is one of the best ways to be your dog\u2019s advocate. There are a million other signs that your dog loves you, like that happy tail wag when you come home and the way she always keeps her eyes on you. The affection is there\u2014your dog just has a different way of showing it! By: Victoria Schade Featured Image: iStock.com/eclipse_images"}]
