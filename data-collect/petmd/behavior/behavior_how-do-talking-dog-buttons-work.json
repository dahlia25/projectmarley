But wouldn\u2019t it be convenient to add the English language to the list of ways dogs can express what they want and how they feel? This is where talking dog buttons come in. You may have seen the dog Bunny and her talking buttons on TikTok or Instagram and wondered if your dog could learn to talk using buttons. Here\u2019s everything you wanted to know about this new way of canine communication\u2014because who wouldn\u2019t want to have a conversation with their dog? What Are Dog Talk Buttons? The buttons are based on alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) devices that give non-verbal people a way to communicate. The sound boards for dogs have circular buttons with words on them, each pre-recorded to say the word when pressed. Let\u2019s say your dog wants to go outside. The idea would be that your dog could press the \u201cOutside\u201d button with their nose or paw to go out in the yard or the \u201cWalk\u201d button to ask to go for a walk. Of course, it takes training for a dog to learn to use the buttons and what each button means. The Science Behind Talking Dog Buttons Anyone who lives with a dog knows they can easily learn what certain words and gestures mean, such as \u201csit\u201d or \u201ccome\u201d or \u201cwant to go for a walk?\u201d Dogs have an amazing ability to understand words\u2014in fact, psychologist John W. Pilley taught his Border Collie, Chaser, the names of over 1,000 toys. Chaser could also understand sentences containing a prepositional object, verb, and direct object. And now, we have talking dog buttons. Bunny uses the FluentPet system for her button board. It uses hexagon-shaped tiles to arrange the buttons according to the Fitzgerald Key, which organizes the buttons by word category. The idea is to make it easier for the learner to remember which button is where. Image Credit: FluentPet\u00a0 Categories often include:\u00a0 Subjects (human names, dog names) Objects (toy, ball, food) Places (bed, couch, walk, outside) Actions (potty, play, come) Descriptors (good, later, all done) Social (love you, hi, want) Just how detailed and accurate talking dog buttons are is still to be determined. There is an ongoing study by Leo Trottier, founder of FluentPet, and Dr. Federico Rossano, a University of California professor and director of the Comparative Cognition Lab at UC San Diego. The aim of the research, according to their site, TheyCanTalk.org, is to use a rigorous scientific approach to determine how much non-human animals can express themselves \u201cin language-like ways.\u201d This is an open study, which means that dog parents and their pups from all areas of the world can participate in the study. As of 2022, the study has over 3,000 active participants and counting. Some cats are also starting to use buttons as a way of communicating with their pet parents. Like, Billi the cat, who has been dubbed &quot;the most talkative feline&quot; on Instagram.\u00a0 Should You Use Dog Communicator Buttons? The buttons are potentially another way for pet parents to have a richer communication with our dogs. Think about it\u2014understanding if your dog needs to go out to use the bathroom is helpful. Many dogs stand silently by the door waiting for someone to notice, but this signal can be easily missed. An auditory signal, such as a dog pushing a button that says \u201cOutside,\u201d would certainly be helpful. This is the button Alexis Devine, an artist based in Tacoma, Washington, started using to teach her Sheepadoodle, Bunny. \u201cWithin a few weeks of coming home, Bunny was using the \u201cOutside\u201d button consistently to let me know when she wanted to go out,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd from that point, it was game on!\u201d Devine was inspired to teach Bunny to talk by watching Stella, a big-eared mixed-breed dog owned by Christina Hunger, a speech language pathologist. Hunger taught Stella to communicate her wants and needs by pressing buttons on a board. Like Bunny, Hunger and Stella have amassed a large following on social media, and Hunger documented their journey in a book, How Stella Learned to Talk: The Groundbreaking Story of the World\u2019s First Talking Dog. Devine says the keys to success are patience, repetition, and the ability to really listen to what your animal companion is saying, including all the things they\u2019re already saying without words. All of this gives us information about what they might want to say with words. Can Any Dog Learn to Use Talking Buttons? Devine explains that any dog can learn to use the buttons in some capacity. \u201cUsing basic operant conditioning to teach a button like \u2018Outside\u2019 is very easy,\u201d says Devine. It\u2019s just like training a dog to ring a bell to go outside. Another easy and useful button to teach would be \u201cPlay,\u201d which is also easy to model. \u201cOne would press the \u2018Play\u2019 button, then begin playing with the dog and repeat the process until the dog is understanding that the two are linked,\u201d explains Devine. Bunny\u2019s favorite buttons have changed over time as she\u2019s matured, explains Devine. \u201cOutside,\u201d \u201cPlay,\u201d and \u201cPoop\u201d were her early favorites, but now she says, \u201cLove you\u201d a lot more. Bunny also combines multiple buttons to convey even more information to Devine. How to Train Your Dog to Use Talking Dog Buttons According to Hunger, the key to teaching your pup this skill is talking to your dog a lot. Hunger explains that just like kids, dogs learn words by hearing words. It is also important to observe which words you tend to use. If you think you want to teach your dog the word, \u201cEat\u201d for mealtime, but you say the word, \u201cFood\u201d more often, then you should use a \u201cFood\u201d button to represent mealtime. Your dog will learn to use the buttons by watching you use them. This is called modeling, and you\u2019ll teach your dog when to use the button by pushing it at the appropriate time. For example, you would say \u201cFood,\u201d push the \u201cFood\u201d button at mealtime, and then give your dog their food. Or you would press the \u201cOutside\u201d button and then take your dog outside. Using modeling (a human presses the \u201cOutside\u201d button) along with repetition and a functional reward (getting to go outside) teaches a dog how to use the button. Tips for Using Dog Talk Buttons Not modeling enough is the biggest mistake you can make when trying to teach your dog how to use talking buttons, says Devine. She explains that, if you want the dog to press the button, they need to see you pressing the button. Here are more tips for using talking dog buttons: Go slow: Every dog is different, and it may take many weeks for a dog to even seem interested in the buttons. Keep them together: A centralized location for the button board is recommended, preferably where your dog tends to hang out. Pay attention: Don\u2019t ignore your dog\u2019s other means of communication, such as body language and vocal cues. You\u2019re not changing how your dog communicates\u2014you\u2019re just adding another option, should your dog be interested. Don\u2019t force it: Never force your pet to push the buttons by picking up their paw and putting it on the button. Have fun with the process: Your dog may enjoy it, or it may not be their cup of tea. And that\u2019s OK! Even without a button board, you have a rich communication system with your dog. Exploring the world of buttons, at the very least, will provide mental enrichment for your pup, and the increased methods of communication can help strengthen your human-animal bond.
