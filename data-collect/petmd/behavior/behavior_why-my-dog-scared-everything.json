Instead of greeting the world with a confident walk and a wagging tail, a fearful dog might shy away from anything new, or worse yet, react preemptively to avoid a new situation altogether. It\u2019s not easy for a pet parent to admit that their dog is scared of everything because trying to work through those fears can be overwhelming.\u00a0 Fearfulness does have a place in the wild; it increases an animal\u2019s chance of survival by keeping them away from danger. But when your dog is acting strange and scared in everyday life, it\u2019s stressful for both ends of the leash and can even have long-term health implications. Let\u2019s take a look at why certain dogs are scared of everything, how to recognize fearful behaviors, which situations trigger fear, and how you can help your dog deal with their fear. What Makes a Dog Scared of Everything? Dogs that seem scared of everything can be products of nature and nurture. A dog\u2019s genetic makeup, early experiences, environment and daily life can all have an impact on their temperament. Lack of Socialization\u00a0 A common reason for fear in dogs is a lack of positive exposure to new people, animals and environments during the critical fear period of the puppy socialization process. This important developmental stage in a puppy\u2019s life occurs between 8 and 16 weeks of age, when pups need to have a variety of pleasant interactions with the world around them. Puppies that don\u2019t have positive exposure to the world around them might be more likely to be wary of anything new or unusual. This can lead them to be scared of things we wouldn\u2019t associate with fear, like people wearing large hats or having a stroller/skateboard/skater go past you. Genetic Predispositions\u00a0 However, some nervous dogs might also have a genetic predisposition to fearfulness or shyness. Puppies born to anxious mothers are more likely to be fearful as well. \u00a0 Traumatic Experiences\u00a0 For some dogs, all it takes is a single traumatic experience to create lifelong fear responses. For example, a dog that\u2019s caught off guard by firecrackers during a walk might then generalize that fear response to any loud noise\u2014like a car door slamming\u2014and might also develop a fear of walking anywhere near where it happened. Pain\u00a0 It\u2019s important to note that some behaviors that look like fear might be related to pain. Dogs that seem \u201chand shy\u201d and nervous about being touched might actually be dealing with an undiagnosed medical issue. Your veterinarian can help you determine whether your dog is experiencing pain or suffering from fear-based issues. Recognizing Fear in Dogs The first step to helping a dog that\u2019s scared of everything is understanding their body language. Some fear displays are hard to miss\u2014like a trembling, hunched-over dog that has their ears back and tail tucked. But learning to recognize subtler fear reactions will allow you to intervene before your dog\u2019s fear escalates. Some of the telltale signs of fear in dogs include: Trembling or shiveringHunched body with head downEars backTail tuckedHair standing up on the neck and backGrowlingShowing teethA dog that\u2019s afraid might also show these more subtle signs: Freezing in placeMoving in slow-motionRepeatedly licking their lipsYawning frequentlyTrying to move away from the stressorPanting heavily or suddenly stops pantingKeep in mind that some behaviors that look like aggression, like leash reactivity and barking, can also be signs of an underlying fear of something. Common Things That Dogs Are Scared Of and How You Can Help Many dog fears are universal\u2014it\u2019s rare that a dog actually enjoys a trip to the vet\u2014however, a dog that\u2019s scared of everything might have a difficult time coping with common, everyday noises or encounters. Loud Noises\u00a0 It\u2019s almost impossible to avoid having a startle reflex when you hear an unexpected loud noise, but dogs that are scared of everything will react more dramatically to noises. For example, a typical dog might jump at the sound of a dropped pan, but a fearful dog might run, hide and then refuse to come out. How to help: If your dog only reacts to certain types of noises, like sirens or fireworks or thunder, you can use behavioral modification to help your dog learn to tolerate the sound. Use a recording of the sound to gradually desensitize him to the noise by playing it at a low volume and pairing it with treats. Increase the sound over a series of training sessions, watching your dog\u2019s body language to make sure that he isn\u2019t becoming uncomfortable with the noise. If your dog is trying to cope with ongoing scary sounds like construction noise, use a white noise machine to muffle the sounds. Children\u00a0 Kids can be fast, loud and unpredictable, and because of that, they can be challenging for even the most even-tempered dogs. But dogs with generalized fear reactions will find children even more distressing, particularly because a child doesn\u2019t understand canine body language and will have a hard time recognizing when a fearful dog is trying to get away. How to help: If you don\u2019t typically have children in your home, it\u2019s easiest to manage your dog\u2019s behavior by keeping him in a safe, quiet space when small guests visit. If you discover that your new dog is fearful around your own children, make sure that he has an area where he can spend time away from them. Then you will need to find a positive-reinforcement dog trainer to help you assess the situation and create a training plan that keeps everyone safe. Other Dogs\u00a0 Unfortunately, not every dog wants to be friends with his own kind, particularly timid dogs. If a dog hasn\u2019t had the opportunity to meet dog friends and develop canine language skills, he might wind up feeling overwhelmed when faced with other pups. How to help: Helping fearful dogs learn to feel more confident around other dogs requires a slow approach and a good understanding of canine body language. You will need to slowly work through dog introductions in order to keep your dog feeling comfortable. For dogs that are mildly uncomfortable around other dogs, you should find a mellow, dog-savvy dog and try walking them together, at the same pace but with distance between them. When both dogs seem relaxed, gradually begin to bring them closer together, making sure that they remain calm and happy as they get closer. Keep early introductions short and end sessions before the nervous dog gets overwhelmed. And remember that making friends with one dog doesn\u2019t mean the behavior will generalize to all dogs. Strangers\u00a0 Some dogs are uncomfortable around people that look different from their family (for example, large men with beards or people wearing hats and bulky jackets), but dogs that are afraid of anyone outside their family can make going into public or having guests over traumatic. How to help: Using desensitization and counter-conditioning can help a stranger-shy dog start to overcome his fears. To begin, figure out your dog\u2019s \u201cbuffer zone\u201d\u2014the area at which he can remain calm when faced with a stranger. Then have the stranger come into view at the edge of that buffer zone and feed your dog a bunch of extra-special treats that he doesn\u2019t normally get. Continue giving treats while the person is in view for a few seconds, then have the stranger disappear. Gradually bridge the gap between your dog and the person over a series of training sessions. Always watch your dog\u2019s body language to make sure they remain calm and confident throughout the training process. Going Outside\u00a0 Sometimes the world outside your front door is a scary place. Dogs that move to a different environment, like from the suburbs to the city, might find the noise and crowds in their new neighborhood overwhelming. Similarly, a traumatic experience outside, like having a fight with another dog, can be enough to create an overwhelming fear of going outside. How to help: Dogs that are afraid to leave their home can benefit from a training process called \u201cshaping.\u201d Shaping makes it easier for dogs to face their fears by breaking behaviors down into manageable steps and rewarding the dog for making progress toward the finished product. Pet parents can begin the process by standing near the door with a handful of treats. When your dog makes any movement towards the door, mark the behavior with a clicker or verbal marker like, \u201cgood!\u201d then toss a treat to your dog. Continue to build on and reward each step towards the door until your dog is able to cross the threshold. Be Patient With Your Dog\u00a0 Keep in mind that a fearful dog should always set the pace for training. Trying to push a nervous dog beyond his comfort zone could derail the training process, so be patient and encourage your fearful pup as he learns to be a more confident dog. Talk with your veterinarian about pairing training and desensitization efforts with natural, holistic calming supplements or pheromone collars. Sometimes, medication is very helpful to calm some dogs in certain situations if natural options have not worked. Also, working with a veterinary behaviorist may be the best option if all other routes have failed.\u00a0 By: Victoria Schade Featured Image: iStock.com/DemureDragonfly Related Video: Tips for Calming Dogs During Fireworks"}]
