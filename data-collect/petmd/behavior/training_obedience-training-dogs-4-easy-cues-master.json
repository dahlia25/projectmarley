These basic cues help dogs improve their impulse control, teach them good manners, and in some situations\u00a0are literal life savers. Keep in mind, \u201cmastery\u201d means that your dog will respond no matter how distracting the environment, so it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll have to continue to brush up on the following skills throughout your dog\u2019s lifetime. But the good news is training is an excellent way to cement your bond with your dog, and even better, it\u2019s fun. 1. A Finished \u201cDown.\u201d\u00a0Many pet parents accidentally leave the \u201cdown\u201d cue incomplete, meaning they have to slap the ground in order to get their dog to move into the position. In fact, you can try a test to see if your dog is actually responding to the word \u201cdown,\u201d or if it\u2019s your body language that\u2019s making him do it. Say nothing, but bend over and slap the ground as you normally do. Your dog will probably go right into a down position. Stand up straight and say the word \u201cdown\u201d without giving any body language hints, and more than likely your dog won\u2019t budge. It\u2019s easy to take this very important cue and polish it up so that you can simply say the word \u201cdown\u201d and your dog responds. To begin, start off by luring your dog into a down as you usually do. Reward your dog with a small treat for doing it, then move a few steps to reset him for the next repetition. This time, though, don\u2019t bring your hand all the way down to the ground as you\u2019ve been doing. Your dog might be confused, but just hold still and wait until he slides into the down position. When he does, give him another treat, then reset by moving a few steps away. In each successive repetition, make the luring gesture with your hand less obvious, until you can stand straight up, say the word \u201cdown,\u201d and point to the ground and your dog quickly moves into a down. Then, continue to practice this behavior in a variety of settings so that your dog generalizes it. 2. A Solid \u201cStay.&quot;\u00a0Some dogs learn \u201cstay\u201d in a very specific context, which usually involves an anxious pet parent chanting \u201cstay, stay, stay\u201d as they back a few baby-steps away. In order to take this cue from iffy to incredible, you need to go back to the basics. Start off by doing a \u201cstay\u201d in the space where you usually practice it, but say the word once instead of repeating it. Remember, eventually you\u2019ll be putting a great deal of distance between you and your dog, and you don\u2019t want to have to scream the word \u201cstay\u201d from across a field. Continue to practice taking just a few steps away from your dog in different directions, and work up to turning your back and walking away for a few steps. Slowly increase the number of steps you can take from your dog, but throw in an easy repetition every so often. Work on this cue all over your house, and then introduce it outside as well. When your dog is reliably holding a stay both inside and out, add some real-life distractions. For example, get your dog to hold a stay while you unload the dishwasher, or have him hold a stay while you put away groceries. The goal is to incorporate the stay into your everyday life so that you can use it to keep your dog from underfoot, and more importantly, keep him safe. 3. A Trustworthy Recall.\u00a0While it\u2019s easy to teach your dog to come when called in controlled circumstances, getting a strong response in real-life situations requires dedication and a strong history of positive associations. Many dogs learn that coming when called means the fun is ending, and instead of running joyfully to their people, they opt to ignore the cue. If your dog has a history of \u201cblowing off\u201d your recall cue, you can build a stronger response with a brand new, baggage-free word. Pick a neutral word that you haven\u2019t been using, like \u201chere,\u201d and practice using it in the house when you\u2019re positive your dog will respond to it. Say the word \u201chere\u201d once, whistle or clap to encourage your dog to run to you, and then give your dog an extra-special treat like chicken or cheese when he\u2019s right in front of you. And don\u2019t forget the praise! Get some friends or family to help out and practice this in different rooms in your house, until your dog is reliably running to you every time he hears the new word. Remember to keep the association positive\u2014never call your dog to you to punish him. Once your dog is responding reliably in the house, take it on the road. Move out to your yard to practice with your dog, always giving him a fantastic reward and lots of praise, until his response to the word \u201chere\u201d is reflexive and speedy. A reliable recall requires ongoing practice, so continue to give your dog periodic surprise rewards and tons of praise when you call him to you. Doing so will help your dog understand that coming to you when you call always means something fantastic is going to happen. 4. An Anti-Jump Cue.\u00a0Jumping up on guests is one of the most common pet parent complaints. It\u2019s tough to keep dogs from jumping, because they learn very early on that jumping up works to get attention. (And it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s angry attention!) Couple that history with the fact that dogs ears seems to fuse shut when they\u2019re excited, and you have the recipe for a dedicated jumper. However, there\u2019s a simple way to use a dog\u2019s tendency to focus on body language to teach an automatic sit, even when meeting a new friend. Even better, you can get your friends and family, from small children to senior citizens, to perform the cue to encourage your dog to sit instead of jump. The cue itself is straightforward and easy to communicate: Stand up straight and cross your arms. To begin teaching it, load up on tasty treats and bring your dog to a quiet room. Move around the room, then come to a stop. Your dog will probably move into a sit automatically since he probably knows you have treats. The second his bottom hits the ground, say \u201cyes!\u201d and hand over a goody. Repeat the process a number of times, moving around your house to different rooms. Spend extra time working with your dog in the foyer where guests congregate. Then, try the cue with friends. Ask someone to approach your dog and tell them to cross their arms. Your dog might pause for a moment, but if you\u2019ve done enough foundation work, he\u2019ll probably go into a sit. Celebrate the victory with a treat. The arm-cross sit is a powerful but simple training cue, and a great way to show off your dog\u2019s good manners. \u00a0"}]
