But why is shredding paper so irresistible to dogs?", "articleBody": "By Lindsay Lowe Dogs have a way of getting into things they shouldn\u2019t, and one thing many pups seem to love playing with is paper. Used tissues, napkins, paper towels, toilet paper\u2014countless pet parents have come home to find these products shredded all over the floor. \u00a0 But why is shredding paper so irresistible to dogs? It often comes down to odor, says Scott Sheaffer, a certified animal behavior consultant and owner of USA Dog Behavior in Dallas, Texas. \u201cIf you\u2019ve used it to wipe your mouth or even wipe your nose or your hands, there\u2019s a scent on it that\u2019s appealing to them,\u201d he says. Boredom or anxiety could also drive dogs to rip up paper products, if they don\u2019t have enough other enrichment available. Or, if dogs are actually ingesting the paper, it could be a sign of pica, a medical condition that drives animals to eat non-food items (humans can also suffer from pica). \u201cIt can become a compulsion, where they obsessively and compulsively eat paper products,\u201d Sheaffer says. \u201cThat\u2019s much more of a behavioral issue than\u2026appetite driven.\u201d More often, though, dogs shred tissues and towels simply because it\u2019s fun, says Erin Jones, a certified dog behaviorist and owner of Merit Professional Dog Training in Halifax, Nova Scotia. \u201cThe number one reason is probably just because they enjoy the sensation of ripping stuff up,\u201d she says. Puppies and adult dogs are equally likely to enjoy playing with paper, Jones says, and it\u2019s a common behavior regardless of breed. \u00a0 Are Paper Products Dangerous for Dogs? Many dogs don\u2019t eat the paper they play with\u2014the joy is in the ripping up\u2014but if pups do ingest napkins or tissues, there could be serious health consequences. \u00a0\u201cSmall amounts of paper will just pass through a dog\u2019s digestive tract,\u201d says Dr. Jennifer Coates, veterinarian and author of the Dictionary of Veterinary Terms, Vet-Speak Deciphered for the Non-Veterinarian. \u201cBut if a large amount is eaten or some of it gets stuck somewhere along the digestive tract, it can cause a blockage that requires surgery to correct.\u201d Also, eating a paper towel that\u2019s coated with a cleaning product or other potentially toxic substance could be dangerous, Jones says. \u201cIt is always best to err on the side of caution, in my opinion, and avoid using harsh or toxic chemicals and discard any used paper products immediately,\u201d she recommends. \u201cParticularly if there is a history of ripping up paper products and there is any chance they might have access to it.\u201d Coates agrees, \u201cToss any paper products that are contaminated with potentially dangerous chemicals directly into a covered trash can in a location where your pets can\u2019t gain access.\u201d \u00a0 Discouraging the Behavior The best way to prevent dogs from ripping up paper is to keep it out of reach in the first place. \u201cDon\u2019t leave these items around,\u201d Jones says. \u201cIf we can manage their environment and prevent this unwanted behavior from happening in the first place, then that\u2019s really the key to any training protocol.\u201d Dogs often pull paper products out of the garbage, so using trash cans with secure, automatically closing lids can nip the problem in the bud. Not all paper products can go in the trash can, though (how many YouTube videos have we seen of dogs gleefully unspooling toilet paper from the roll?), so a more foolproof solution is to train dogs not to go near paper products in the first place. Jones often uses impulse control training with her clients to discourage destructive behavior. \u201c[Dogs] get rewarded for staying away from the item,\u201d she says. \u201cThat way, they learn to wait for direction from you instead of just impulsively going after everything that they want.\u201d Teaching your dog a \u201cdrop it\u201d cue can also be helpful, she says. In a pinch, your dog can rest comfortably in a crate when you\u2019re not around, or you can close doors or use baby gates to block off access to certain parts of your home. To let your dog play with paper in an appropriate way, consider turning his instincts into an enriching game. This could mean \u201cputting treats into a cardboard box and taping it up and poking holes and allowing them to rip that apart,\u201d Jones says. \u201cIt allows them an outlet for that behavior.\u201d If your dog gets hold of a tissue or napkin and won\u2019t let go, there\u2019s one thing you definitely shouldn\u2019t do: chase him around and try to get it back. That makes your pup think it\u2019s all a fun game. \u201cOwners\u2026yell, \u2018Give me that napkin back!\u2019 and they go running after the dog,\u201d Sheaffer says. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve done by those actions is you\u2019ve just increased the value of the item to the dog.\u201d Instead, it\u2019s better to ignore the behavior (unless your dog is ingesting the paper, or if the paper is covered with a dangerous substance), then quietly remove it when your pet is distracted. Bottom line, dogs will probably always love ripping up paper, but there are plenty of ways to manage the behavior and keep your dog out of harm\u2019s way."}]
