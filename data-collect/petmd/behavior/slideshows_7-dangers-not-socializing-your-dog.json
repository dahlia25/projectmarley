The goal is to give your puppy the tools to understand that \u201cnew and different\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to \u201cbad and scary.\u201d Having positive experiences with a variety of people, places and things during those critical few weeks of social development \u2013 roughly between eight to fourteen weeks of age \u2013 can help set the stage for a lifetime of confidence and appropriate responses to new experiences. Though the socialization checklist is long, working through it can be a joyful process of discovery for both dog and pet parent. \u00a0 But what happens if a puppy doesn\u2019t get the benefit of early socialization? How might that impact the dog when its fully grown? Behavior is a product of both nature and nurture, a mix of genetics and experience, but it\u2019s possible that under-socialized dogs can exhibit any of the following problems. A dog that hasn\u2019t been exposed to positive new experiences is a dog that\u2019s likely to be frightened of anything that isn\u2019t familiar. That trash bag flapping in the breeze or garden statue at the edge of a neighbor\u2019s yard might be enough to make the dog cower and retreat. These dogs can have crippling anxiety about anything that\u2019s unfamiliar, which manifests in an unwillingness to approach new situations and environments.\u00a0 Fearfulness often masquerades aggression, so even though it might seem like a reactive dog is in an aggressive attack-mode, it\u2019s possible that the display is based in fear. Under-socialized dogs often don\u2019t have the coping skills to appropriately respond to stressful scenarios, so they react defensively in an effort to maintain a buffer from the \u201cscary\u201d stimulus, whether it\u2019s a person, another dog, a bike or an umbrella. A dog that wasn\u2019t exposed to handling exercises as a puppy likely feels uncomfortable with grooming since it never had a chance to learn that a comb isn\u2019t a torture device. That makes basic husbandry, like nail clipping and tooth brushing, challenging if not impossible. Because the process is so overwhelming for both dog and pet parent, these nervous dogs have to go to the vet for basic grooming procedures that could easily be taken care of at home.\u00a0 Many dogs are afraid of thunder and fireworks, so a lack of socialization isn\u2019t to blame in those scenarios. However, dogs that are nervous about unexpected but everyday sounds like the whir of a ceiling fan or the beep of a fire alarm battery are at a disadvantage because of the prevalence of the noises. These dogs typically withdraw from the sound and display avoidance behaviors. An under-socialized dog\u2019s world is very small, because life outside the front door is frightening and unpredictable. Going in the car, stopping by dog-friendly stores and hiking new trails are out of the question because the dog isn\u2019t comfortable in the new environments. One of the most important steps in socialization is gently introducing the puppy to different types of people including children, people in hats, men with beards, senior citizens with walkers and people of different ethnicities. If a puppy doesn\u2019t have the opportunity to meet friendly strangers at his own pace, he might react fearfully \u2013 whether retreating or barking preemptively \u2013 any time he meets someone he perceives as different. We all want our dogs to have dog buddies, but if a puppy wasn\u2019t able to meet a variety of dogs of all ages and sizes at a young age, there\u2019s a chance he\u2019ll be wary about making canine friends as an adult. Early dog-on-dog socialization is critical because it allows dogs to hone their communication skills. Without exposure to the language of play, it\u2019s easy for a dog to misconstrue a frisky nip as an invitation to fight.\u00a0 You can avoid the dangers of under-socialization with a well-constructed plan that addresses all of these potential problem areas. Sign up for a well-run puppy socialization class where your dog can meet new friends and learn the rules of friendly play. Take the time to explore your puppy\u2019s body, including the paws (specifically the nails), mouth, ears and eyes using \u201ctouch for a treat\u201d training. Create a checklist of different types of people to meet, but make sure that participants let your pup approach them on his own time. Gently expose your puppy to different noises at low levels. Carefully introduce household equipment, like brooms and unplugged vacuums. Allow him to explore different surfaces, like sidewalk grates and slick floors. Encourage him to check out objects like parked bikes, garbage cans on wheels and strollers. Although it\u2019s critical to expose your puppy to new environments, avoid areas with porous ground where many unfamiliar dogs go, like parks, during the early stages of socialization. \u00a0 Keep in mind, though, that it\u2019s not just the quantity of experiences your puppy has, it\u2019s also the quality. The secret to socialization success is to make sure that it\u2019s always a positive experience for your puppy. Forcing him to meet someone he\u2019s tentative to approach might actually backfire and reinforce any underlying fear. Similarly, plopping him in the middle of a sandpit when he\u2019s only been on grass might cause undue stress. Work through your puppy\u2019s socialization checklist slowly, always allowing your pup to move at his own pace, and always making sure that he has an escape route from the action should he need it. If you plan ahead and don\u2019t leave anything to chance, your puppy will have a rich vocabulary of real-world skills. \u00a0 Victoria Schade is a certified dog trainer and author."}]
