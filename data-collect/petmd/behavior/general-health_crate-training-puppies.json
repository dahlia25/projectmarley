The most significant? Providing her with a quiet, safe space she can go to whenever she feels overwhelmed or needs some alone time. Many dogs continue using their crate as a safe haven throughout their life\u2014if pet parents get them used to it early. Here\u2019s what to know about crate training a puppy. Why Is Crate Training a Puppy Important?  Many people think of crate training solely as a way to keep your dog confined when you\u2019re away from home. But the reality is that a crate offers many positives for your pup.\u00a0 Provides a safe, quiet space for dogs:\u00a0Dogs are den animals, meaning they like to have their own space where they can go if they feel stressed or scared. When used appropriately, a crate can provide that den-like comfort.\u00a0 Aids in housetraining:\u00a0Dogs don\u2019t like to soil the area they sleep in, so a crate helps puppies learn to hold their bladder for longer periods of time. This is very handy when\u00a0potty training a puppy.\u00a0 Emergency evacuation:\u00a0If you need to\u00a0evacuate due to a natural disaster, many shelters allow pets\u2014as long as they are crate trained. Dogs that are crate trained are also less likely to be lost or run away in an emergency.\u00a0 Traveling:\u00a0A crate helps keep your pet safe during travel and is generally required when flying.\u00a0 Prevents destructive behaviors:\u00a0A crate helps prevent puppies from getting into things that could be dangerous when they can\u2019t be supervised.\u00a0 Overnight stays at the veterinarian:\u00a0When dogs are really sick, they sometimes need to stay overnight at the vet hospital. Being crate trained helps to make them feel more relaxed.\u00a0 Rest after an injury:\u00a0Some dogs need strict rest after an injury or surgery, and the crate provides this space for them so they can\u2019t hurt themselves further. Dogs that aren\u2019t crate trained will sometimes feel stressed in the crate and will have a hard time relaxing after their procedure.\u00a0 Prevents separation anxiety:\u00a0To help\u00a0prevent separation anxiety, pet parents can put dogs in their crate in another room of the house where they can\u2019t see you. This slowly helps them adjust to not having you immediately present.\u00a0 Choosing a Crate  There are several types of crates available, including hard plastic and wooden crates, metal crates, soft crates, foldable and collapsible crates, heavy-duty crates, highly mobile crates \u2026 the list goes on. With all these different options, it can be difficult to know which crate is right for\u00a0your\u00a0puppy.\u00a0 When choosing a dog crate, ask yourself:\u00a0 How big is the pup expected to get?\u00a0 What will the crate be used for?\u00a0 Am I planning to travel with it?\u00a0 Is my\u00a0pup a super chewer?\u00a0 What is my pup\u2019s temperament?\u00a0 How much am I willing to spend?\u00a0 Do I want the crate to match my home decor?\u00a0 The most important of these considerations is the crate\u2019s size. It should be large enough for your dog to stand up, turn around, and lie down comfortably. This means when choosing a crate for a puppy, you need to estimate how big she\u2019s going to get (so you hopefully don\u2019t need to upgrade as she grows). If you aren\u2019t sure, your veterinarian can help provide a safe estimate of your pup\u2019s adult size.\u00a0 But having a crate that\u2019s too big for your little puppy does have a drawback. When crates are too large, dogs will soil their crate because they can still lie far enough away from their mess. Ideally, get a\u00a0divider for the crate\u2014this lets you adjust the amount of space your pup has access to as she grows.\u00a0 Here are a few other key features that make a good crate:\u00a0 Sturdy:\u00a0While most dogs are perfectly content in their crate, some are a little more stressed and may try to chew. A sturdy crate helps prevent chewing and the damage it can cause.\u00a0 Multiple entries:\u00a0This helps provide easier access to the crate for both pets and pet parents.\u00a0 Easy cleaning:\u00a0Crates can get dirty quickly, especially when house training a puppy. Metal and plastic crates tend to be easier to clean than fabric crates.\u00a0 Rounded corners:\u00a0Sharp corners can injure you or your pup, so it\u2019s best to choose a dog crate with rounded corners.\u00a0 Transportable:\u00a0Ideally, a crate should be small enough to carry, have wheels to roll it, or be collapsible so it can be easily transported to alternative locations.\u00a0 How to Crate Train a Puppy  Crate training can take days or weeks depending on your dog\u2019s age, temperament, and any previous experiences they\u2019ve had. The most important thing when crate training a puppy is to\u00a0always use the crate as a positive place; never use it for punishment.\u00a0 1. Make the Crate Safe and Comfortable\u00a0 Make the crate feel like a welcoming and safe place by putting it where your family spends the most time, such as the family room. Placing\u00a0soft blankets\u00a0or a\u00a0dog bed\u00a0inside can help to make it feel more comfortable, too, though some dogs do prefer to lie on hard surfaces.\u00a0 Keeping the door propped open and allowing your dog to explore the crate at her leisure can be helpful. Some dogs will even just naturally start sleeping in the crate right away.\u00a0 2. Introduce Your Dog to the Crate\u00a0 If your pup isn\u2019t naturally inclined to go to the crate on her own, bring her over to the crate and talk to her in a positive and happy voice. Keep the crate door propped open so that it doesn\u2019t accidentally hit your pup and frighten her. Putting small treats near or just inside the crate\u2019s door can also entice your pup to explore the area. If your puppy refuses to go inside initially,\u00a0don\u2019t force her to go in!\u00a0It\u2019s critical that she never feels forced to use the crate.\u00a0 As your pup gets more comfortable being near the crate, you can progressively put treats farther inside to get her to go all the way in. This positive reinforcement with treats should be repeated until she\u2019s comfortable walking in and out of the crate. Alternatively, if your pup is not food motivated, you can use\u00a0her favorite toys\u00a0as positive reinforcement.\u00a0\u00a0 Introducing your pup to the crate can take as little as a few minutes to as long as several days. It\u2019s important that you be patient with her and don\u2019t rush her as she gets comfortable with the crate.\u00a0 3. Feed Your Pup Meals in the Crate\u00a0 Once your dog is introduced to her new space, start to feed her regular meals near or inside the crate. This will help her create a positive association with it.\u00a0 If your puppy is comfortable in the crate, you can place the food dish on the far end of the crate (furthest from the door). But if your puppy is still reluctant to go inside, only place the food as far as she feels comfortable entering the crate. Then, each time you feed her, progressively push the food farther and farther back into the crate.\u00a0 4. Close the Door\u00a0 Once your puppy is comfortable standing fully inside the crate, try to close the door while she\u2019s eating. The first time you do this, you should open the crate door as soon as she\u2019s finished with her meal.\u00a0 Progressively leave the crate door closed for longer and longer periods of time, starting with 1 minute and working up to about 10 minutes after eating. If your puppy starts to whine while closed inside the crate, it\u2019s likely you increased the length of time too quickly and should go back to a shorter time period for the next few feedings.\u00a0 5. Leave Your Pup Alone\u00a0 Once your dog seems comfortable with the crate and is regularly eating her meals inside, start to confine her there for short periods of time while you\u2019re home.\u00a0 Start by using a treat to entice her to enter the crate and giving a command of your choosing, such as \u201cCrate\u201d or \u201cHouse.\u201d Once your puppy enters the crate, praise her and give her the treat, and then close the door.\u00a0 You can then sit quietly near the crate for a few minutes before entering another room for a bit. When you return, sit quietly by the crate again for another minute or two, and then let your puppy out. Repeat this process while gradually increasing the amount of time your puppy is left alone.\u00a0 6. Crate Your Dog When You Leave\u00a0 Once your puppy can relax quietly in the crate for about 30 minutes, you can start to leave her alone in the crate while you\u2019re gone for short periods of time.\u00a0 To do this, put your dog in the crate (using the command that you have chosen and a treat). Try to vary when she goes in the crate during your \u201cgetting ready to leave\u201d process so that it doesn\u2019t start to promote\u00a0separation anxiety. This can be anywhere from 5-20 minutes prior to leaving, but try to keep the timeframe short.\u00a0 The goal is to make leaving seem as insignificant as possible to your puppy. Praising her briefly and giving her a treat for entering the crate is enough, and then you can leave quietly.\u00a0 As hard as this may be, it\u2019s important that you aren\u2019t overly enthusiastic if your puppy is showing excited behavior when you come back. Keeping your return as calm as possible will help to make her feel less anxious about when you will get home and help prevent separation anxiety.\u00a0 Once your puppy is fully crate trained, it\u2019s important that you continue to crate her occasionally when you\u2019re home so that she doesn\u2019t always associate the crate with you leaving. \u00a0\u00a0 7. Crate Your Dog at Night\u00a0 Once your puppy is comfortable with the crate, you can start crating her overnight. It\u2019s important to remember that puppies often have to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night and\u00a0will cry to tell you, so it can be helpful to\u00a0put the crate in your bedroom at night\u00a0so any bathroom cries can be heard.\u00a0While puppies sometimes whine\u00a0when they\u2019re first put into the crate, these cries are typically associated with anxiety, whereas cries in the middle of the night typically indicate that they need to go to the bathroom.\u00a0 Having the crate in your bedroom can also be helpful because your pup will be able to smell you and won\u2019t feel so isolated. This can also be helpful for older dogs that are getting crate trained.\u00a0 As your puppy gets more comfortable being in the crate overnight, you can gradually begin to move it to the preferred location in your home.\u00a0 Tips for Making Crate Training a Puppy Successful  To help make crate training your puppy go smoothly, here are some things to keep in mind:\u00a0 Ideally, keep the crate in your bedroom or a nearby hallway. This helps your puppy feel close to you, which can help her to feel more comfortable in the crate.\u00a0 During the day, it can be helpful to keep the crate in the room where you and your family spend the most time. Again, this helps your puppy feel close to you, even if she\u2019s in her crate.\u00a0 The most important thing with crate training is to never use it for punishment.\u00a0 It\u2019s also critical that you train puppies in small steps and don\u2019t go too fast. If you go too fast and they feel forced to use the crate, it may cause them to have negative associations with it.\u00a0 Featured Image: iStock/SolStock\u00a0 \u00a0"}]
