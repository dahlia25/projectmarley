Read more.", "articleBody": "By Caitlin Ultimo We all have that friend, relative,\u00a0or rival who walks their dog with expert leash-wielding skills. They aren\u2019t being pulled down the block, tied &#039;round trees,\u00a0or tangled up with the friendly neighbor dog who\u2019s also out for an afternoon stroll. I don\u2019t know about you, but I silently envy the person and pet that can walk side-by-side without breaking a sweat.\u00a0 And\u00a0I have to admit, good leash walking skills are important for more than just showing off your pet-parent talents. \u201cFrom a relationship perspective,\u201d explains Sarah Fraser, a certified professional dog trainer and co-founder of Instinct Behavior &amp; Training in New York City, \u201cif your dog is walking nicely on a leash, it likely means that your dog is paying more attention to you, making it easier for you to provide direction and guidance as needed along your walk.\u201d\u00a0 A leash-puller can also run the risk of accidentally breaking away from your grip, which can pose multiple dangers to your pet if he or she continues to run, not to mention the danger for\u00a0yourself if you end up face-first on the sidewalk. Having proper leash manners minimizes the risk that you will be pulled over in a moment of overzealous leash yanking and will make the time more about walking and less about tug-of-war.\u00a0 \u201cTeaching your dog to walk nicely on a leash allows you to take her more places and for longer walks, because it\u2019s more comfortable and enjoyable for the both of you,\u201d Fraser says.\u00a0 Tips for Better Walking Behavior Whether your dog is big or small, here are six ways to improve your dog\u2019s behavior on a leash: \u00a0\u00a0 Adjust your attitude.\u00a0 First, ask yourself: \u201cWhat would I like him or her to do instead?\u201d Instead of teaching a dog to\u00a0stop pulling, think of it as teaching your dog how to\u00a0walk nicely beside you. Remember it\u2019s all about the rewards.\u00a0 One of the easiest and most effective ways to start teaching a dog to walk properly on a dog leash is to reward the dog for paying attention to you\u00a0and for being in the desired position (next to you or close to you) when out for a walk. \u201cAs the dog learns that walking next to you is a pleasant, rewarding experience, she\u2019ll spend less time pulling and more time walking nicely beside you,\u201d says Fraser. Try using very special treats in the beginning, like small pieces of boiled chicken or roast beef, to really get your dog\u2019s attention, she advises.\u00a0 If you are worried about spoiling your pup&#039;s meals you can use\u00a0pieces of dehydrated dog food or freeze-dried dog food\u00a0from your pup&#039;s daily meals. That will help you to make sure you are not overfeeding your dog while also supplying them with tasty incentives for good behavior. Play the \u201cfollow me\u201d game.\u00a0 Hold on to your leash and take several backward steps away from your dog. The backward movement is inviting, so your dog is likely to turn and follow you. Say \u201cyes!\u201d as your dog approaches you, then immediately reward him or her with a treat. \u201cThe game helps your dog focus and move with you,\u201d says Fraser. Then back away several steps in another direction. Once again, says \u201cyes!\u201d as your dog approaches and reward him or her with a treat. Repeat this pattern eight to 12 times, until your dog is actively pursuing you when you move away. Practice on your regular walks. Once you\u2019ve started your stride, each time your dog looks up at you or walks next to you, says \u201cyes!\u201d and immediately reward him or her with a treat. Reward often.\u00a0 &quot;Frequent rewards will help your\u00a0dog figure out more quickly what behavior you\u2019re looking for and make the learning process easier for her,\u201d Fraser explains. \u201cThe trick to making this work\u00a0is using very special treats at first, and keeping your rate of reinforcement high, which just means that you are marking and rewarding often\u2014maybe every 4-5 steps at first\u2014for any and all \u2018good\u2019 leash behavior.\u201d Over time, you can thin out your rate of reinforcement, rewarding your dog less frequently throughout the course of the walk, Fraser adds. Consider additional assistance.\u00a0 \u201cIf your dog is already a practiced puller, consider purchasing a quality front clip harness to provide extra control on walks,\u201d Fraser recommends. But if your dog already pulls hard with a\u00a0no pull dog harness, consider working with a certified, positive reinforcement-based trainer. Finally, remember that walking on a leash is a skill that takes time and practice for both the pet parent and dog, so celebrate incremental improvements and successes!
