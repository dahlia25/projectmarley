Here are some reasons why your dog may not be walking on their leash, from dog training to dog health issues.", "articleBody": "Image via Olena Kurashova/Shutterstock.com By Teresa Traverse Going for a walk is an important part of almost every dog\u2019s life. Many dogs require and enjoy daily strolls with their owners. So, if you\u2019re the owner of a new puppy or an older dog and they are refusing to walk on a dog leash, it can be frustrating and concerning. From dog training issues to dog health issues, a pet owner\u2019s mind can run the gauntlet when their dog refuses to walk on a leash. Here is a list of some of the reasons why a dog won\u2019t behave while on leash. She\u2019s a Puppy \u201cA lot of people just sort of assume putting a leash and attaching it to a dog is natural to the dog, but it\u2019s not,\u201d says Megan Stanley, chair of the board of directors for the Association of Professional Dog Trainers, and owner of Dogma Training &amp; Pet Services in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Take your time when leash training a dog or new puppy, and introduce the equipment slowly, suggests Stanley. \u201cAnytime they\u2019re introducing a new piece of equipment, it\u2019s good to just bring it out and let the dog explore it. Smell it. Check it out. Versus just going and putting it on it,\u201d says Stanley. Make sure your dog\u2019s okay with her dog collar by slowly introducing it so she can get accustomed to wearing it. Stanley suggests pairing the dog supplies, like dog leashes and collars, with food rewards. Once your puppy feels safe and secure with the collar on, attach the leash to it. Let your puppy drag the leash around. You should also offer your puppy rewards as she moves around with the leash on to create positive associations. Start in your home, and then take it outside. But always remember to be patient. The next step is to pick up the leash but to let your puppy lead you where she wants to go (within reason!). Only once your pup is comfortable wearing her collar and leash and having you on the other end of the leash should you try directing her movements. Stanley says that most people just expect their puppy to understand leash training and to immediately walk nicely. But Stanley explains, \u201cThey get out, and there are so many distractions. There are smells. There are people. There\u2019s wildlife like squirrels.\u201d When your dog starts to walk forward after you\u2019ve asked, be sure to reward her when she\u2019s moving and not stopping. Many owners will go back to their dog and reward the stopping, which is counterproductive. When it comes to picking dog treats, aim for a high-value treat you know your dog loves. Stanley recommends freeze-dried liver treats. Don\u2019t forget to also verbally praise them for walking forward, too. She\u2019s a Shelter Dog If your adult dog came from a rough background and is not used to walking on a leash, it will take her time to learn how to walk nicely on one. \u201cAn adult dog can be more challenging. They\u2019ve got to relearn the behavior. You\u2019re reteaching them. Everything they\u2019re doing is learned behavior. You have to teach them something new. It\u2019s going to be a longer process,\u201d says Stanley.\u00a0 The training process is identical to one you\u2019d use with a puppy\u2014start slowly, reward your dog positively and don\u2019t give up. \u201cPatience really goes the longest way,\u201d says Dr. Ryane Englar, DVM, assistant professor of clinical education coordinator at K-State University. She explains that just because they are an adult dog, it does not mean they already have leash skills or experience being on a leash. She\u2019s Anxious or Fearful \u201cThey might just find going out into the world scary. They just need to find that confidence,\u201d says Stanley. To help out your dog, start gradually. Introduce her to the world and reassure her that she\u2019s safe. If your dog sees something that scares her, soothe her and interact with her. Try not to make such a big deal out of something that\u2019s not a real threat, like a garbage truck. If your dog is fearful of a garbage truck, be proactive and try to avoid walking your dog when the truck is out, suggests Stanley. \u201cUsually they just need a few minutes to recover and realize they\u2019re not in danger,\u201d says Stanley. Sometimes it\u2019s best to take breaks if your dog just won\u2019t walk. \u201cIf you\u2019re getting frustrated, then it\u2019s best just to give up and start a different day,\u201d says Dr. Englar. She also recommends being gentle and positive, speaking in warm tones. You also can try to praise your dog or engage her during a walk to encourage her. She\u2019s in Pain \u201cI\u2019m much more worried about the dog that always walks fine and then it doesn\u2019t walk fine. That to me would be a concern,\u201d says Dr. Englar. \u201cIt might be a sign of pain.\u201d Some possible causes of your dog not wanting to walk could be an infection, an illness, a metabolic disease, undiagnosed diabetes, organ failure or Lyme\u2019s disease, says Dr. Englar. \u00a0 If you have concerns or if you notice a marked change in behavior that doesn\u2019t resolve itself quickly, book an appointment with your veterinarian. \u201cAnytime that you\u2019re uncomfortable with how they\u2019re acting, meaning something\u2019s consistently off about them, it\u2019s always better to be safe than sorry,\u201d says Dr. Englar.\u00a0 How Dog Harnesses Can Help If your pup has never been trained to walk on a leash, it might be easier with a dog harness. Stanley recommends trying a dog harness like the\u00a02 Hounds Design Freedom No Pull Dog Harness. Harnesses prevent dogs from straining their necks, too. Dog harnesses \u201cdon\u2019t put any pressure on unnecessary spots on dogs but still alleviating the pulling,\u201d says Stanley. Dr. Englar advises using the PetSafe Gentle Leader quick release dog headcollar if your dog pulls. She advises against using choke chains. If your dog has received a clean bill of health and you\u2019ve tried, and failed, to train her to walk on a leash yourself, it\u2019s time to enlist the help of a dog trainer. Trainers who use only positive forms of reinforcement (no punishment!) can quickly get your dog looking forward to calmly walking by your side on her leash.\u00a0"}]
