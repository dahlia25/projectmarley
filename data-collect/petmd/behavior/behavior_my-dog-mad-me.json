In a matter of minutes, you start to hit the panic button. Did you do something to make your coworker upset? As difficult as it is to interpret your friend\u2019s emotions and their underlying causes, it\u2019s even more difficult to do the same with your dog. And if you feel like your dog is angry with you, it\u2019s not as easy as simply asking your pup if everything is OK. So, is your dog mad at you? Here\u2019s what the experts had to say about your dog\u2019s feelings: Do Dogs Feel Emotions? \u201cThat\u2019s not even on the table in terms of debate,\u201d says Linda Case, owner of AutumnGold Consulting and Dog Training Center in Illinois and author of The Science Dog. \u201cBasic emotions like joy, fear, and anxiety\u2014dogs definitely experience them.\u201d Nannette Morgan, a certified dog trainer and associate certified dog behavior consultant based near San Jose, says affection, suspicion, excitement, and shyness are also common emotions dogs feel. She explains that a dog\u2019s emotional development caps around that of a two-and-a half-year-old human. Do Dogs Get Angry? They can, Morgan says, but dogs don\u2019t have the capacity to assign a motive to an emotion, which means being angry at you (or anything) isn\u2019t something for which there is evidence. This also means behavior that seems angry\u2014growling, snapping, barking, etc.\u2014is more in-the-moment than it is built-up and vengeful. It also means this behavior is just as likely to be indicative of frustration, fear, disappointment, or annoyance than it is anger as we tend to think about and experience it. But My Dog Seems Mad at Me. Am I Crazy? If you feel like your dog is mad at you, you may simply be reading into his behavior. It\u2019s natural for humans to shift blame in certain difficult situations, says Case, especially onto themselves. \u201cMaybe your dog isn\u2019t getting as much exercise as he\u2019s used to because your schedule has changed. Maybe, for a similar reason, he has some separation anxiety,\u201d she says. \u201cGenerally speaking, it\u2019s easier for us to say, \u2018He\u2019s mad at me for something I did,\u2019 rather than consider that he has anxiety and doesn\u2019t handle being alone well.\u201d Another strong possibility is that the appearance of anger stems from a physical problem. \u201cDogs are less inclined to show that they\u2019re in pain. It\u2019s evolutionary,\u201d Morgan says. \u201cYour dog might not limp, but if he has a sore or strained muscle or tweaks his back, that could appear as if the dog is mad at you.\u201d What Should I Do? Don\u2019t waste time trying to self-diagnose a problem. If your dog appears to be exhibiting anger, depression, or any other behavior changes that are severe or last for more than a few days, it\u2019s worth getting a professional medical opinion. \u201cIf your dog isn\u2019t eating or is generally less physical or showing signs of malaise\u2014that can be a sign of something as simple as an injury or arthritis, or it could be more serious,\u201d Case says. \u201cAnything that seems like he\u2019s not his normal self is cause for concern and should be checked out by a veterinarian.\u201d My Dog Is Healthy. Now What? \u201cSo much of what we see in terms of behavior changes are unfortunately couched in anxiety or fear,\u201d Case says. That means there could very well be some trigger in your dog\u2019s environment that\u2019s bringing on the appearance of anger. It could be something as small as a new or loud object that spooks him, or he could be reacting to something different that you\u2019re doing\u2014such as playing less or traveling more. Perhaps he\u2019s dealing with the loss of another pet or family member. Whatever the case, when you can isolate the trigger, you can start to help him acclimate to it or otherwise cope. If that\u2019s not working, you may want to consider consulting with a professional behaviorist in your area."}]
