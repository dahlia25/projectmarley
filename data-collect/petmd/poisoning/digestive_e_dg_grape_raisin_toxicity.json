All foods containing grapes and raisins including grape juice raisin filled cookies trail mix and even bagels should be avoided at all costs to prevent poisoning dogs who eat grapes or raisins may exhibit vomiting or diarrhea within just a few hours of consumption as the toxicity progresses. Dogs may become lethargic lose their appetites experience abdominal pain and show signs of dehydration.\n\nIf the toxicity levels are high a dog may eventually pass only a small amount of urine or stop producing urine altogether. If this happens the dog is in jeopardy of kidney failure. To date researchers have not been able to pinpoint the exact substance in raisins and grapes that causes this toxic reaction in dogs. But veterinarians know that even a small amount of grapes or raisins can be potentially fatal to dogs.\n\nIf you suspect your dog has eaten any amount of grapes or raisins it should be treated as a medical emergency. Pet owners may be directed to induce vomiting by their veterinarian but you should not induce vomiting. If your dog is not conscious is having trouble breathing, or is exhibiting signs of serious distress or shock. Even if you do get your dog to vomit shortly after consuming grapes or raisins you should still seek immediate veterinary treatment.\n\nEmergency veterinarians may use activated charcoal to stop absorption of the toxin and place your dog on intravenous fluids to help flush the toxins out of the system as quickly as possible. Veterinarians may perform a complete blood count a chemistry profile and a urinalysis to assess damage to the kidneys. Prognosis for the dog will depend on when medical intervention was started and how ill the dog was at the start of treatment to prevent grape and raisin poisoning. It's important to keep these food items off of counters and out of reach of dogs at all times.\n\nNever leave your dog unsupervised around grapes or raisins and make sure children and other houseguests know not to offer grapes or raisins to your pet as a snack.", "potentialAction": {"@type": "SeekToAction", "target": "https://www.petmd.com/dog/emergency/digestive/e_dg_grape_raisin_toxicity?wtime={seek_to_second_number}", "startOffset-input": "required name=seek_to_second_number"}}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "BreadcrumbList", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 0, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.petmd.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Dog Emergencies", "item": "https://www.petmd.com/dog/emergency"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "Article", "headline": "Can Dogs Eat Raisins?", "inLanguage": "en-US", "isFamilyFriendly": "True", "isAccessibleForFree": "True", "articleSection": "Poison &amp; Toxicity", "thumbnailUrl": "https://image.petmd.com/files/styles/863x625/public/2022-07/collection-of-various-raisins-picture-id1293011150.jpg", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://image.petmd.com/files/styles/863x625/public/2022-07/collection-of-various-raisins-picture-id1293011150.jpg"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hector Joy, DVM", "url": "https://www.petmd.com/author/dr-hector-joy"}, "keywords": "Dog, Poisoning, Can Dogs Eat, Symptom Checker, Raisin Poisoning", "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "PetMD", "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.petmd.com/images/petmd_logo.png"}, "url": "https://www.petmd.com"}, "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.petmd.com/dog/emergency/digestive/e_dg_grape_raisin_toxicity"}, "datePublished": "October 26, 2020", "dateModified": "September 12, 2023", "description": "Dr. Hector Joy discusses why raisins are toxic to dogs, the signs of toxicity, and what you can do if your dog has eaten raisins.", "articleBody": "Raisins may seem like a harmless and healthy snack, but for dogs, they can cause a lot of trouble. Why are raisins bad for dogs if they\u2019re fine for us to eat? Here\u2019s some valuable info on why dogs can\u2019t eat raisins and what to do if you even suspect that your dog ate even one raisin. Are Raisins Bad for Dogs?\u00a0 Raisins are toxic to dogs. They are just dehydrated grapes, which are also toxic to dogs.\u00a0 Do not give your dog raisins or raisin products, and make sure your dog does not have access to them at all times. Make sure that all family members and visitors know that raisins are toxic to dogs and should never be given to your dog. Grape and raisin toxicity in dogs can cause serious kidney damage that can lead to acute (sudden) kidney failure, which can be fatal. The exact toxic substance in grapes and raisins is unknown, but it\u2019s believed that it could be the inability of dogs to metabolize flavonoids, tannins, and monosaccharides from the grapes. \u00a0 Even bagels with raisins should not be given to dogs. Raisins and raisin products don\u2019t provide any nutritional value that can\u2019t be substituted with dog-safe fruits, such as apple slices.\u00a0 Should I Worry if My Dog Ate One Raisin?\u00a0 The toxic number of raisins is unknown, and it doesn\u2019t affect all dogs the same. Based on known cases of grape toxicity in dogs, even one or a few grapes or raisins can cause acute kidney failure, which can be fatal. Kidney failure is not seen in all dogs that eat raisins, but we don\u2019t know why some dogs are affected excessively while others are not. But regardless, raisins are bad for any dog to consume, and you don\u2019t know how your dog will react. Signs of Raisin Toxicity in Dogs\u00a0 The onset of symptoms tends to occur between 12-24 hours after a dog eats raisins. Symptoms of raisin toxicity in dogs include: Vomiting and/or diarrhea, often within a few hours of ingestion. You may see pieces of raisins in your dog\u2019s stool or vomit. Increased urination (initial stages) Drinking a lot (initial stages) Decreased urination or not urinating (sign of the kidneys shutting down) Loss of appetite Lethargy, weakness, or unusual quietness Dehydration (Check by gently pulling up the skin at the back of your dog\u2019s neck. If it doesn\u2019t go back into place right away, your dog is dehydrated.) Bad breath What to Do if Your Dog Ate Raisins\u00a0 If your dog eats raisins, treat it as an emergency situation. Take your dog to your local veterinarian or pet emergency clinic for assistance. Call the clinic to let them know you are coming and that your dog ate raisins or may have eaten raisins. You can also call the Pet Poison Helpline at 855-764-7661 or the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center at 888-426-4435 on the way to the vet\u2019s office. Do not induce vomiting if you have not been instructed to do so, and especially if you aren\u2019t sure what your dog ate or if your dog is: Unconscious Having trouble breathing Showing signs of serious distress or shock Your dog may vomit on their own, but whether or not your dog vomits, you still need to go to the vet immediately. What Will the Vet Do to Help a Dog That Ate Raisins? The mainstay of treatment at the vet\u2019s office starts with decontamination. Your veterinarian will try to induce vomiting to get the raisins out. Then they will give activated charcoal to help bind any leftover raisins in the stomach and absorb the toxin. Expect that your dog may need to be hospitalized for 48 hours so the vet can give intravenous fluid therapy and monitor your dog\u2019s kidneys through bloodwork. \u00a0 Featured Image: iStock.com/Almaje"}]
