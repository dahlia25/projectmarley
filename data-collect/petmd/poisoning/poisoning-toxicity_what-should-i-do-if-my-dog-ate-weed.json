Here\u2019s what you need to know about dogs eating marijuana and what you should do.", "articleBody": "Reviewed for accuracy on August 26, 2019, by Dr. Katie Grzyb, DVM \u201cMy dog ate weed\u2014now what?\u201d You\u2019re not alone in asking this question. According to a veterinary study in Colorado, incidences of marijuana intoxication in dogs increased dramatically following the drug\u2019s legalization. \u201cAn increasing number of pets are being diagnosed with\u00a0marijuana\u00a0toxicity,\u201d says Dr. Jim D. Carlson, a holistic veterinarian and owner of Riverside Animal Clinic &amp; Holistic Center, located in the Chicago area.\u00a0\u201cAs\u00a0marijuana\u00a0laws are changing, so is the exposure that pets have to the drug.\u201d While marijuana toxicity may be common, it\u2019s a serious condition that requires swift recognition and treatment. Are Some Forms of Marijuana More Toxic to Dogs? Since the legalization of marijuana is more widespread, it\u2019s now available in many different forms. From the plant to oils and edibles, there are plenty of opportunities for dogs to get their paws on some weed. However, each of these types of weed have their own risks for dogs. \u201cThe toxin in marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is highly concentrated in the flower buds and tiny leaves on top of the plant,\u201d explains Dr. Ibrahim Shokry, BVSC, MVSC, PHD, professor of Pharmacology and Toxicology at\u00a0Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine. \u201cMarijuana leaves have less than 10% THC. Oils and butters used in making candies and food products contain the highest concentrations of THC\u2014up to 90%\u2014and are the most toxic,\u201d says Dr. Shokry. What If Your Dog Ate an Edible? In addition to THC, many edibles contain other dangerous ingredients. \u201cEdible forms can add to the toxicity, as they are often formulated in combination with ingredients such as chocolate, which can be lethal in high enough doses, and butter, which can cause GI upset and potentially pancreatitis,\u201d says Dr. Caroline Wilde, staff veterinarian at pet medical insurance company Trupanion. Symptoms of Marijuana Toxicity in Dogs While most humans experience fairly pleasant effects from marijuana, dogs don\u2019t simply get the munchies and take a nap. \u201cClinical signs develop within minutes to hours of exposure and last for hours to days,\u201d says Dr. Shokry.\u00a0\u201cThey are mainly signs of central nervous system depression.\u201d Clinical signs include: Incoordination Sensitivity to loud noises Low heart rate Dribbling urine Dilation of the pupils Low or high body temperature Additional symptoms include: Vomiting Irregular heartbeat Urine retention Dr. Rachel\u00a0Barrack, founder of Animal Acupuncture in New York City, says that extreme cases can cause: Tremors Seizures Comatose state Dogs experience these distressing side effects more strongly than humans. \u201cDogs have more cannabinoid receptors in their brains than people,\u201d says Dr. Barrack. \u201cTherefore, the effects of\u00a0marijuana\u00a0are more severe and potentially more toxic.\u201d Don\u2019t Be Scared to Take Your Dog to the Vet If you suspect that your dog ate marijuana, seek immediate veterinary care, without hesitation. Your pet\u2019s health is more important than any embarrassment you might feel, and it\u2019s critical to be honest with your veterinarian. It\u2019s also important to inform them of the exact type of marijuana your pet has eaten, as different forms have different toxicities. \u201cRest assured that you aren\u2019t the first person to come in with a case of this nature,\u201d assures Dr. Carlson. \u201cWe are only in the business of providing the best care for your pet, not judging or getting law enforcement involved if you live in a state where\u00a0marijuana\u00a0isn\u2019t legalized.\u201d What Tests Will the Vet Do? Your dog is going to be very disoriented and confused. While you quickly get ready to go to the veterinarian, keep them in a quiet room to help reduce sensory stimulation. Once you arrive at the vet\u2019s, they will evaluate your dog to see the level of toxicity and the current state of your dog\u2019s body functions. \u201cTo determine the health status of your pet, organ function and the seriousness of the toxicity, expect your veterinarian to perform blood work and a urinalysis,\u201d says Dr. Carlson. \u201cDogs sometimes eat the container the drug was kept in or other material when ingesting\u00a0marijuana, making diagnostic imaging necessary,\u201d he explains. Blood pressure is often checked, too, since the heart rate can be greatly decreased and these animals sometimes require intravenous fluids to support their blood pressure. Treating a Dog That Ate Weed In cases where the ingestion is quickly discovered, your veterinarian may induce vomiting to prevent the onset of symptoms, says Dr. Wilde. In most cases, however, that window has passed, and symptoms must be treated on a case-by-case basis. Dr. Wilde explains that most treatment will consist of supportive care, which includes (but is not limited to): Hospitalization for continued monitoring Administration of fluids Cardiovascular support Regulation of temperature In some cases, anti-nausea medication If a marijuana edible also contained chocolate, treatment is more aggressive. Chocolate can cause high heart rates, seizures and even death, so treatment can include antiarrhythmics, anticonvulsants, fluid therapy and activated charcoal, adds Dr. Wilde. How to Prevent Marijuana Toxicity Although the symptoms and treatment can be scary, most dogs recover from marijuana toxicity.\u00a0 \u201cThis might be a noted medical episode for your dog, but\u00a0marijuana toxicity is not often fatal in pets,\u201d says Dr. Carlson. Even so, it\u2019s important to ensure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. If you use marijuana, keep an up-to-date inventory of all products, and ensure that they\u2019re out of your dog\u2019s reach at all times. \u201cOwners should take care in the storage of\u00a0marijuana\u00a0in the home,\u201d advises Dr. Carlson. \u201cStoring the drug high in a cabinet in a container such as a jar with a metal lid will prevent accidental injury.\u201d \u00a0By: Monica Weymouth Featured Image: iStock.com/Chalabala"}]
