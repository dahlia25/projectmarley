Marked by their thick, fleshy leaves, succulents are native to desert environments but adapt easily to a variety of conditions. These hardy plants can thrive both indoors and outdoors, making them a favorite among both experienced gardeners and budding green thumbs. While succulents can be great, low-maintenance houseplants for humans, they are not always a great option if you have furry family members. If ingested, some varieties of this trendy plant could harm cats and dogs. Most succulents are nontoxic to our pets, but some are dangerous and even poisonous. Succulents That Are Poisonous to Dogs and Cats If you have a dog or cat in your household, you should steer clear of the following varieties of succulents. Aloe Vera  Image via iStock.com/ek_kochetkova One of the most popular succulents, aloe vera is frequently used for medicinal and therapeutic purposes. Its sap is traditionally used to treat sunburns, and the plant\u2019s extracts can be found in supplements, cosmetics, and flavored waters. However, this succulent can be poisonous to pets. Aloe is known to cause gastrointestinal distress, such as vomiting and diarrhea, even making the pet lethargic. Aloe plants are characterized by long, spiked tendrils. Some varieties have white spotted foliage, while others flower periodically. All varieties should be kept away from pets.

Jade plants have thick, woody stems and plump, oval leaves, giving them a tree-like appearance. There are a number of varieties of jade\u2014and all should be kept out of reach of pets. If your cat or dog ingests jade, they may experience symptoms including gastrointestinal upset and incoordination.

Haworthia  Image via iStock.com/arraymax If you\u2019re a fan of aloe vera\u2019s spiked silhouette, consider a haworthia instead. Also known as the zebra cactus, this easy-to-grow succulent has a similar appearance but is nontoxic to pets. Burro&#039;s Tail  Image via iStock.com/jerryhopman With lush trailing tendrils, the burro\u2019s tail is perfect for displaying in hanging planters and on shelves. Although it doesn\u2019t usually bloom, some plants will offer pink or red flowers under perfect conditions during the summer. Protecting Your Pets From Toxic Plants With thousands of varieties of succulents and increased availability of exotic plants, the best way to protect your pets is to identify exactly which plants are poisonous to dogs and cats, and refrain from bringing them into your home. Before buying a new plant, check the\u00a0ASPCA\u2019s extensive poisonous plant database as well as the Pet Poison Helpline\u2019s toxicity list. If you already have plants in your home and garden, look up each one to verify that it is safe for pets. It\u2019s also important to note that any plant, toxic or not, can cause problems for pets. Even non-toxic plants can cause gastrointestinal upset when ingested, especially for pets with sensitive stomachs. Other plants can even have chemicals or pesticides on their leaves, causing additional issues with pets. Pets should always be discouraged from eating plants in the house. It is helpful for pet parents should know the names of every plant in their home\u2014including nicknames and Latin names. If your pet does end up eating one of your nontoxic plants, or happens to eat a plant that could be poisonous while on a walk or while visiting a friend\u2019s home, the best thing you can do is to first identify the plant. Many veterinarians would have difficulty identifying many dangerous species of succulent. It is best to know the plants in your home and if a pet ingests an unknown plant, look it up immediately for potential toxicity and call your veterinarian immediately. Before an incident occurs, you can familiarize yourself with some of the most common poisonous plants for dogs and cats that grow in your area or that friends might have as houseplants.
