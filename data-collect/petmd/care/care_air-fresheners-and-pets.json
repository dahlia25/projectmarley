Learn more about the dangers to pets from scented products.", "articleBody": "Reviewed and updated for accuracy on May 28, 2020 by Jennifer Coates, DVM As parents and caregivers, one of the earliest lessons we learn is the concept of \u201cbaby-proofing\u201d\u2014keeping toxic substances and dangerous situations well out of the way of our children. As pet parents, we need to do the same. But unlike children, instead of this being a temporary obligation, it\u2019s something we\u2019ll need to do throughout the lives of our pets. Some of the things we do to improve our environment, such as cleaning or using chemical air fresheners, can pose dangers to our animal friends, whether furry, feathered, or scaled. So, do pet owners need to forever do away with their room sprays, plug-ins, candles, oils, and solids? That\u2019s a question that\u2019s not so easily answered. However, there are some ways to play it safe when using these products in the home. \u201cIf we are putting some kind of chemical into the air merely to mask scents, then we have to be concerned about the negative implications for our pets,\u201d says holistic veterinarian Dr. Patrick Mahaney of California. Sadly, some forms of air fresheners can be quite toxic, especially to animals (and children!) who might ingest the substances or not have the wherewithal to avoid parts of the home where they\u2019ve been used. The Ingredients That Makes Air Fresheners Dangerous for Pets According to Dr. Mahaney, one of the main offenders in the ingredient list for most air fresheners are volatile organic compounds (VOC). VOCs are organic chemicals that have a high vapor pressure at room temperature. This causes these compounds to easily turn into gasses or vapors from a solid or liquid form. This transformation is called volatility. In other words, volatility is just how air fresheners are meant to behave: dissipate into the air, thereby changing its scent. Unfortunately, this is the same volatility that occurs in paints and varnishes, fossil fuels, benzene, formaldehyde, refrigerants, aerosol propellants, cigarette smoke, and the dry-cleaning process. You wouldn\u2019t open a can of paint in your living room to improve the quality of the air, but this isn\u2019t too far removed from what happens when you break out an air freshener. These substances can cause a laundry list of maladies. According to the\u00a0Environmental Protection Agency, the health effects of VOCs may include: Eye, nose and throat irritation headaches, loss of coordination, lethargy and nausea damage to liver, kidney and central nervous system Some VOCs can cause cancer in animals; some are suspected or known to cause cancer in humans. And in a\u00a0study\u00a0published in the Environmental Impact Assessment Review, testing of top selling air fresheners and laundry detergents \u201cfound 133 different VOCs emitted from the 25 products, with an average of 17 VOCs per product. Of these 133 VOCs, 24 are classified as toxic or hazardous under U.S. federal laws, and each product emitted at least one of these compounds. For \u201cgreen\u201d products, emissions of these compounds were not significantly different from the other products.\u201d Natural Alternatives to Air Fresheners: Are Essential Oils Safer? For the air freshener industry, the latest catch phrase is \u201cessential oils.\u201d Despite this natural-sounding name, these products are by no means entirely safe. Essential oils are also defined as volatile, and while these substances are extracted from flowers, bark, berries, roots, seeds, and woods, and do have some potential medicinal and positive effects, they can still be very toxic to people and animals, particularly when they are used improperly. \u201cEssential oils, which are included in many air freshener products, can be very toxic, especially to cats. If you simply have to have essential oils in the home, make sure they are kept in a location where your pets cannot come into direct contact with them,\u201d says veterinarian Dr. Jennifer Coates of Fort Collins, Colorado. \u201cAlso, birds are more sensitive to potential airborne toxins than are other animals, so I generally recommend a \u2018better safe than sorry\u2019 approach with the use of air fresheners around them.\u201d When it comes to using these products around our pets, a little information is your best defense. \u201cRead the instructions on the side of the bottle and be sure you are\u00a0spraying\u00a0the recommended amount,\u201d says Dr. Mahaney. \u201cWhen you walk into a room that\u2019s been heavily sprayed with air freshener, what does it do to your eyes and lungs? If it\u2019s doing that to you, it\u2019s also going to do that [or worse] to your pets.\u201d Signs of a Toxic Reaction to Air Fresheners in Pets According to Dr. Mahaney, the negative effects of air fresheners may appear immediately or within a few hours or days after use. When you first use them, a pet might immediately withdraw from the area or cower. A pet might cough, sneeze, produce discharge from the eyes and/or nose, or suffer from vomiting, diarrhea,\u00a0lethargy, or lack of appetite. Long term effects are also possible. Dr. Mahaney says \u201cCats have had an increase in feline\u00a0asthma\u00a0as a result of living in households where there are air fresheners, incense and cigarette smoke\u2014or even just the aroma of cleaning products.\u201d However, these dangers don\u2019t come from the air alone. They can also be caused by contamination from where air fresheners fall \u2013 where a pet might step, roll, or lick \u2013 or from products such as carpet shampoos and cleaners that are specifically made for surfaces. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to spray something that\u2019s going to leave an aroma, I suggest that you don\u2019t give your pets access to it,\u201d says Dr. Mahaney. \u201cIf you\u2019re cleaning, you don\u2019t want to leave a significant residue\u2014they could walk across it and potentially lick it off their paws.\u201d What to Do if Your Pet Eats an Air Freshener Ingesting an air freshener can be even more dangerous than simply breathing it in. Any long-term usage products, such as solid or plug-in air fresheners, need to be closely monitored, and extra care needs to be taken when you dispose of them. If your pet is inclined to go through the trash, you might want to dispose of spent air fresheners directly in an outside trash receptacle. \u201cIf an animal ingests an air freshener, I worry primarily about its effect on the\u00a0gastrointestinal\u00a0system,\u201d says Dr. Coates. \u201cThe active ingredients and/or the packaging could cause vomiting, diarrhea, etc. Systemic effects are also possible depending on the chemicals and amounts involved.\u201d \u00a0And that is not confined to chemically scented products. \u201cEssential oils can not only affect the GI tract, but they also are associated with neurological problems like agitation, weakness, unsteadiness, and tremors in dogs\u2014and especially in cats.\u201d \u201cAnything with a fibrous nature to it can cause digestive distress, and some products may be absorbed through the small intestine and get into the blood,\u201d explains Dr. Mahaney. So, how do you know if the products you use around your home are relatively safe? Dr. Mahaney recommends doing some research on the\u00a0ASPCA\u2019s Poison Control Center Website. This resource covers all sorts of toxins that your pet might encounter, from air fresheners, cleaning products, human and pet medications, foods, plants, and other substances. In case of a poisoning emergency, there is a 24-hour hotline at (888) 426-4435, although a $65 consultation fee might be required. And in the case of a true emergency, make sure to get your pet to a veterinarian as quickly as possible. By David F. Kramer Featured Image: iStock.com/Smikey26"}]
