In the car, to the beach, for walks, a swim. And now, there\u2019s something else you can do with your dog -- Yoga! Dubbed &quot;Doga,&quot; it seems this new craze is taking the nation by storm. There are books and DVDs and even classes to be had \u2026 Getting &quot;Down&quot; with Downward-Facing Dog Strange as it may seem, yoga for dogs makes sense. Just watch how your canine buddy stretches -- it&#039;s as if they were built for it. And it\u2019s not only good for Rover\u2019s health, flexibility, and relaxation, but yours, too. Loving the Limelight It should come as no surprise that your dog will love the attention a doga class offers. An instructor (or you) will watch his every move and guide him gently into the proper positions. And even if your dog isn&#039;t down with the doga, he&#039;ll still have a good time peacefully checking out all the ladies in the room. Plus, he&#039;ll be with you -- his favorite person in the whole wide world. Reaching EquilibriumWe all lead super busy lives, and sometimes it\u2019s hard to squeeze in exercise and quality &quot;together&quot; time with your favorite pooch. That\u2019s why Doga is perfect. You get to workout, relax, your dog gets to exercise, and best of all, you both get to spend time ... together! If Doga is something you\u2019re interested in, check and see if there\u2019s a class offered in your neighborhood. Or, pop your favorite yoga workout into the DVD player, get your dog, and just start doing it. You\u2019ll be surprised how quickly both of you become relaxed. Doga. It\u2019s not just for dogs.
