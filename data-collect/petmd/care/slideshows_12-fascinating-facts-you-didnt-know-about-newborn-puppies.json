But there are some things new pet parents should know to ensure their pups grow into healthy and happy dogs. Here\u2019s what our vet experts had to say.\u00a0 \u00a0 Puppies develop and grow inside their mother\u2019s womb for approximately two months. This is the normal gestation period (or length of pregnancy) for dogs. In the sense of development, \u201ca newborn puppy is not unlike a premature child,\u201d explains Dr. Margret Casal, associate professor of medical genetics at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s School of Veterinary Medicine. \u00a0 Healthy size and weight are entirely dependent on the breed, explains Dr. Richard Wheeler, owner and practitioner at Poudre River Veterinary Clinic in Fort Collins, Colorado, and a faculty member at Colorado State University\u2019s College of Veterinary Medicine. But ideally, all newborn puppies should double their birth weight after the first week, he says.\u00a0 \u00a0 Puppies can\u2019t see or hear for the first two weeks of their lives, but they can make puppy noises. \u201cThey\u2019ll vocalize right from the beginning,\u201d Wheeler says. \u201cWhen they are born, the mom will lick the placenta off to stimulate them.\u201d \u00a0 At around 10 days, they\u2019ll start to open their eyes, even though they aren\u2019t fully formed yet. \u201cThe rudimentary eyeball hasn\u2019t formed completely until up to 10 weeks,\u201d Wheeler describes. All puppies are born with a blue-gray color to their eyes, Casal adds. Their \u201ctrue\u201d eye color will be evident at around 10 weeks. \u00a0 As for hearing, Casal says, \u201cMost newborn puppies can hear a little bit when they are born. However, their ears are still closed until about 14 days of age.\u201d \u00a0 Dr. Bonnie Brown and Dr. Ashley Davis of New York City\u2019s Gotham Veterinary Center point out that newborn puppies eat every two hours. Even without vision, puppies use their reflexes and instincts to find their mother\u2019s nipple to nurse, notes Casal. \u00a0 In between feedings, they sleep about 90 percent of the day, or 22 hours, Davis and Brown share. \u00a0 Newborn puppies rely on their mothers to stimulate them to go to the bathroom. Wheeler says that if the mom isn\u2019t in the picture, humans can help with this process by gently rubbing a puppy\u2019s rear end with a wet paper towel until they urinate and defecate.\u00a0 \u00a0 Temperature is an important factor for newborn pups. As Wheeler points out, puppies can\u2019t regulate their own body temperature very well. Ideally, they should be kept in a setting of 75 degrees at 80 percent humidity so their digestive tract, immune system, and other bodily processes can function normally.\u00a0 \u00a0 Puppies \u201chave sharp little nails when they are born,\u201d Casal notes. It\u2019s typically best to wait until 4 to 6 weeks of age to clip their nails, but this can be done sooner if they are hurting the mother, she says. \u00a0 They are also born with hair and fur, but the amount depends on the breed. \u201cWhen they\u2019re born, they have a puppy coat,\u201d Wheeler explains. \u201cAs they grow over their first year, dogs that shed will shed out their puppy coats and grow their adult coat.\u201d \u00a0 Their teeth start coming in at around 4 weeks old, Davis and Brown share. Between 3 and 4 months old, they begin to lose their baby teeth to make way for their adult teeth. \u00a0 As newborns, puppies will scoot and crawl around. Between 3 and 12 weeks of age, they will really start walking and improving other motor skills (including wagging their tails), Davis and Brown say.\u00a0 \u00a0 Puppies are most vulnerable to illnesses like parvo and distemper around 4 to 12 weeks of age, Wheeler says. Newborn puppies are also susceptible to canine herpesvirus in their first three weeks of life, which they can contract from other dogs in the household or from their mother before or after birth. Unfortunately, very young puppies who are exposed to large doses of canine herpesvirus almost always die. \u00a0 A newborn puppy should not be separated from his mother and littermates before 8 weeks old and can stay for up to 12 weeks. Separating a puppy too soon can affect his health and growing immune system. \u201cBy keeping puppies with their mother, they are less likely to be exposed to infectious diseases,\u201d Casal explains. \u201cIf you take them away, their immune system is not fully developed yet, and you\u2019re exposing them to other things that could get them sick.\u201d \u00a0 It\u2019s not just health that\u2019s essential when it comes to a growing pup. Between 3 and 14 weeks of age is a critical socialization period for puppies, according to Davis and Brown. \u00a0 \u201cPuppies need to recognize and interact with dogs and other species, such as humans and cats. It is recommended to begin socialization at 3 weeks of age, as this is a period of rapid brain development. At this time, puppies are fully aware of and are able to respond to their environment.\u201d At around 4 weeks old, puppies will start to play in groups, they add. \u00a0 Once puppies are adopted and living in their new home, pet parents should take them for their first vet visit at approximately 8 weeks of age, Davis and Brown advise. \u201cIntestinal parasites can be prevented by deworming medication and by keeping your dog in a clean environment. All puppies should have their stool checked for parasites by a veterinarian.\u201d \u00a0 Puppies should also receive their first vaccinations around this time, as the antibodies from their mother\u2019s milk start to wear off, Wheeler adds.\u00a0"}]
