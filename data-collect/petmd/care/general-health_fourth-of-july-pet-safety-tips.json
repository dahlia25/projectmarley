Here is how to keep your cat or dog safe, comfortable, and anxiety-free this holiday.", "articleBody": "When gearing up for a fun-filled Fourth of July, it\u2019s important to keep in mind all of the potential risks to our pets during the festivities. While this holiday will likely include many potential stressors for our pets, there are steps we can take to minimize the impact. Here\u2019s how to keep your pets safe this Fourth of July. 1. Keep Your Pet Indoors It\u2019s best to keep pets inside during July Fourth celebrations. For one, dogs don\u2019t sweat to cool themselves the way we humans do, making them much more susceptible to overheating. Many dogs are also overwhelmed or overly excited by a large gathering of people, and some people aren\u2019t comfortable or confident interacting with dogs. Keeping your dog in the house is a great first step, but it\u2019s more ideal to have your pet behind a barrier when there are people coming in and out of the house. This helps ensure your pet doesn\u2019t have the opportunity to dart outside and get loose. This could be: A baby gate An interior door A crate A pen 2. Create a Safe Space for Your Pet Consider how the excitement of the day may affect your pet. For cats and dogs more sensitive to noise, a room that has the least exposure to the outdoors and the best sound dampening would likely be most comfortable for them. They will appreciate a cozy bed or a familiar place for them to lounge, enrichment toys or their favorite chew, and fresh water. Adding white noise or music to drown out additional noise, or a pheromone diffuser such as Feliway\u00ae or Adaptil\u2122, can provide additional stress relief. 3. Prepare for Noise Phobias If your pet has shown fear, anxiety, or stress with sudden loud noises in the past, it is best to start making arrangements for them a few weeks before the Fourth of July. This includes discussing their sensitivity with your vet and planning for the holiday. This may include: Prescription medications for your dog or cat Calming chews or supplements, such as VetriScience Composure or Nutramax Solliquin Chewable Tablets Environmental modifications Anxiety vests, such as a ThunderShirt Appeasing pheromones Practicing desensitization and counter conditioning to firework sounds leading up to the holiday can also help reduce fear. Pets who are anxious typically should not be left alone, so hiring a pet sitter or making plans to stay with them during fireworks is also important. Practicing desensitization and counter conditioning to firework sounds leading up to the holiday can help reduce fear.4. Make Sure Your Pet Has an Up-To-Date ID Even when taking all precautions, accidents can still happen. It\u2019s important to make sure your pet can be easily identified and returned to you if they do get loose. Having your pet wear a collar with up-to-date contact information can make their prompt return more likely. Having your animals microchipped\u2014and the microchip registered with all necessary information\u2014provides an added method of identification if they happen to lose their collar. It\u2019s also a good idea to have clear, up-to-date photos of your pets in case they go missing. 5. Don\u2019t Give Your Pet People Food While it can be tempting to share our Fourth of July feast with our pets, it\u2019s often not safe to do so. Many common backyard barbecue foods carry serious medical risks for both dogs and cats. Beyond the risk of gastrointestinal upset, many ingredients are also incredibly toxic to our pets, such as onions, garlic, and grapes.  Dogs cannot digest high-fat foods well, and ingesting large quantities of snacks like brisket or hot dogs can lead to a very painful condition called pancreatitis. Things like corn cobs and meat bones pose a risk of causing a GI obstruction. If bones are chewed and splinter, the sharp pieces ingested may lead to perforations of the esophagus or intestines. It\u2019s best to avoid sharing food with your pet altogether. 6. Avoid Letting Your Pet Around Alcohol Alcohol can be very toxic to dogs and cats, causing depression of the central nervous system, organ failure, and even death. It\u2019s important to note that alcohol does not have to be ingested for your pets to have a toxic reaction; it can also be absorbed through the skin. For your pets\u2019 safety, any product containing alcohol should be kept out of their reach. Alcohol does not have to be ingested for your pets to have a toxic reaction; it can also be absorbed through the skin.7. Don\u2019t Let Your Pet Play With Glow Sticks Glow sticks are very popular on July Fourth, but they are not safe for pets. Glow sticks contain the chemical dibutyl phthalate and, though it\u2019s non-toxic, when chewed or ingested glow sticks can cause reactions in dogs and cats such as: Drooling Pawing at the mouth Agitation Potentially vomiting 8. Keep Your Pet Away From Citronella Citronella is commonly used during the summer as an insect repellant. It can be found as candles, sprays, torches, essential oils, and in plant form. But none of these products are ideal for our pets to be around. Burning citronella can be a respiratory irritant for pets, and ingesting the candles can cause severe GI upset. Coming into contact with a citronella plant can cause skin irritation in pets, while ingesting the plant can cause vomiting, abdominal pain, hypersalivation, and weakness. It\u2019s best to avoid having our dogs and cats around any type of citronella. 9. Stay Alert for Signs of Overheating Pets don\u2019t tolerate hot, humid weather well, and high temperatures can put them at risk of overheating. Providing ample shade and plenty of cool water are two things we can do to minimize this risk, but it\u2019s important to keep an eye out for signs that our pets are too hot. Heavy panting, labored breathing, drooling, red mucus membranes, and an increased heart rate are all possible signs of an overheating pet. Brachycephalic pets, pets with laryngeal paralysis, or pets with other types of respiratory compromise are even more at risk of overheating, so extra precautions should be taken to protect them from the summer heat. 10. Be Wary of Open Flames Firing up the grill for a yummy barbecue is a quintessential Fourth of July tradition. Unfortunately, grilling is not an activity that\u2019s safe for our pets to take part in. All pets should be a minimum of 3 feet away from open flames or hot grills. It\u2019s even more ideal to have the grill be inaccessible to them completely. Smoke inhalation can cause significant respiratory irritation, so avoid having pets downwind of any flames. Lighter fluid, matches, and lighters are all toxic to our pets, and the grease drippings from the grill are also not safe for them to lick up. Preparing ahead of time and taking the necessary precautions to ensure the well-being of our pets can allow us all to have a fun\u2014and safe\u2014holiday. Featured Image: Adobe/otsphoto"}]
