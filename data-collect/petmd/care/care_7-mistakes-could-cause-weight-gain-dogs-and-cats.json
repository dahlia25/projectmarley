If your pup is looking a little on the plump side, it&#039;s possible that you are the culprit. Here are seven common pet parent mistakes that could pile the pounds on your furry one. You&#039;re \u201cGuestimating\u201d How Much to Feed If you&#039;re not measuring your dog&#039;s food\u00a0and instead just filling the dog bowl, there&#039;s simply no way to know if you&#039;re overfeeding or not. \u201cWhen I ask owners how much they feed, most have no idea,\u201d says holistic veterinarian Dr. Judy Morgan, DVM, who regularly lectures and writes on pet nutrition topics. \u201cWhen I use a measuring cup and actually show them what 1 cup of food looks like, they are amazed.\u201d If you&#039;re using a cup, fistful or bowl to scoop out the food, Dr. Morgan suggests switching right now to a measuring cup, before you make any other changes. Read the bag to find out how much you should be feeding your dog or cat based on his ideal weight, or ask your vet if you&#039;re not sure. Then use a proper measuring cup so you can feed the correct amount every time. For both dogs and cats, leaving food out all day can also lead to overeating. If you&#039;re gone for long periods of time during the day, consider using a portion control programmable feeder, like the Aspen Pet LeBistro pet feeder, so your pet still has access to food, but only in the right amounts. You\u2019re Adding an Extra Treat Here or There Dogs need approximately 20-30 calories per pound of body weight per day, according to Dr. Morgan. \u201cIf you consider a 20-pound dog, for example, the average caloric daily requirement will only be around 500 calories; maybe only 400 if pretty sedentary,\u201d says Dr. Morgan. \u201cSome store-bought treats can be very high in calories, and many are filled with sugar.\u201d Unfortunately, the calorie content of some treats is out of control, according to\u00a0Dr. Justin Shmalberg, DVM, one of less than 100 board-certified veterinary nutritionists in the country. \u201cI routinely see treats, especially dog biscuits, make up more than one third of a dog\u2019s overall daily caloric needs,\u201d says Dr. Shmalberg.\u00a0 A good example of this is a 50-pound dog, who, according to Dr. Shmalberg, should eat an average of about 1000 calories per day, but gets much more than that because of dog treats. \u201cA medium-sized dog biscuit can contain about 40 calories, and it\u2019s not uncommon for some people to give five of those biscuits to their dog per day,\u201d Dr. Shmalberg says. \u201cThat\u2019s a 20 percent higher intake than what\u2019s needed; over the course of a year, this could easily add pounds of fat to a dog\u2019s body.\u201d If you&#039;re using dog treats\u00a0as a way to keep your dog entertained between meals, consider switching to something like the Outward Hound Fun Feeder Interactive Dog Bowl, which challenges your dog to work for his food and slows down eating, keeping him busy for longer. You\u2019re Forgetting to Account for Training Treats In general, you don\u2019t want more than 10 percent of a pet\u2019s daily calories coming from treats, and you want those treat calories accounted for in your daily targets, says Dr. Shmalberg. \u201cYou can use a bigger treat so long as you break it up, and you are aware of the overall number of calories in each treat, so that you can keep track of what you\u2019re feeding,\u201d Dr. Shmalberg adds. When choosing treats for training, Dr. Morgan points out you should be reading labels to find a treat that&#039;s low in calories, as you\u2019ll probably be giving many of them throughout a training session. \u201cPureBites is a treat that is very low-calorie, contains dried meats and organs, and is easy to break into small bits,\u201d Dr. Morgan says. You\u2019re Suddenly Walking Your Dog Less Switching to walking your dog once around the block instead of twice might not seem like a big deal, but it might leave you with a chubbier pup. \u201cWe know that the amount of calories used during walking is proportional to the distance traveled, so it\u2019s better to look at distance rather than time,\u201d says Dr. Shmalberg. \u201cIf you cut the distance in half, you\u2019re also cutting the calories burned in half.\u201d The bad news for pet parents everywhere is that exercise can\u2019t substitute for portion control or caloric restriction in overweight animals, according to Dr. Shmalberg. So while cutting exercise sessions short can result in weight gain, increasing activity probably won\u2019t make much of a difference if your dog is already chubby. \u201cI was involved in a study that looked at dogs doing relatively intense exercise on an underwater treadmill at a trotting speed,\u201d Dr. Shmalberg says. \u201cWe found that 30 minutes of exercise only resulted in a daily increase in how many calories were consumed by about 5 percent\u2014that\u2019s better than nothing, but an overall small impact.\u201d You\u2019re Feeding Low-Quality Food Low-quality dog food can absolutely cause weight gain, according to Dr. Morgan. Unfortunately, Dr. Shmalberg emphasizes that there isn\u2019t a single specific ingredient that experts can malign and identify as the sole culprit of pet weight gain. \u201cIt\u2019s really just a mismatch between what a pet needs and the number of calories that pet is given,\u201d says Dr. Shmalberg. A well-balanced, high-quality pet food\u00a0is always the best choice. When in doubt, talk to your veterinarian about your pet\u2019s specific nutritional needs. You\u2019re Not Using Prescription Foods (When You Need To) Prescription dog food, like Hill&#039;s Prescription Diet r/d Weight Reduction dog food, and prescription cat food\u00a0could be a good move if your dog or cat is already overweight. \u201cWeight management diets often have published research studies showing that they cause pets, specifically dogs, to lose weight, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re the only diet that will be effective,\u201d says Dr. Shmalberg.\u00a0\u201cThe need for these diets should be evaluated by a pet\u2019s veterinarian, who can give targeted advice based on an individual pet\u2019s goals.\u201d Prescription dog food\u00a0is not the right choice for every pet, however. Dr. Shmalberg points out many of these diets are high in fiber, and this can make some of them less palatable, especially if your pet is used to treats and table scraps. You\u2019re Being Too Generous With Table Scraps People food is not always a bad thing, as long as you pick the right kind and feed it in moderate amounts\u2014but most pet parents probably don\u2019t. \u201cI&#039;m fine with the dog having an egg, as long as 75-100 calories are deducted from the processed food fed that day,\u201d says Dr. Morgan. \u201cThe down side of table scraps is when the fatty trimmings from meat, gravies and high-calorie, unhealthy scraps are fed.\u201d Dr. Shmalberg is also a big proponent of fresh foods (including steamed vegetables) and even other people foods, but all in moderation. \u201cA 10-pound Chihuahua, for example, should be fed an average of about 280 calories per day,\u201d says Dr. Shmalberg. \u201cIf his parent sneaks in half a slice of deli meat or maybe a quarter of a Polish sausage, that\u2019s 50-60 calories\u201420 percent more than he needs.\u201d Something else to keep in mind is that in addition to causing weight gain, table scraps can also cause other issues. \u201cHigh-fat ingredients \u2026 will contribute to pancreatitis and hemorrhagic gastroenteritis,\u201d Dr. Morgan says.
