Putting the work in ahead of time will also make you less nervous, which will in turn help keep your pup calm in the air. \u00a0 \u201cWe are so fearful of [our dogs] misbehaving, we transmit our anxiety to them through our breathing [and] nervous movements,\u201d says Harrison Forbes, celebrity dog trainer and animal behaviorist. \u201cThe dog thinks \u2018mom or dad is nervous, something awful is going to happen. I am nervous, too.\u2019 We feed off each other and become more and more anxious. I\u2019ve witnessed that on airplanes, trains and other confined spaces.\u201d \u00a0 This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you shouldn\u2019t fly with your dog, however. It just means that you\u2019ll want to spend plenty of time coming up with a plan to keep your dog happy and comfortable in the air. Here\u2019s how: Before you book a ticket, talk to your veterinarian to determine if your dog can fly. Dogs that are very young, old, in heat, pregnant or have chronic illnesses or poor temperaments should not fly, says Dr. Carol Osborne of Chagrin Falls Veterinary Center and Clinic in Ohio. \u00a0 Then, you\u2019ll want to confirm airline restrictions and regulations. \u00a0 \u201cThe first thing to do before you travel is to check with the airlines,\u201d says Osborne, noting that some airlines ban certain breeds. \u201cFind out all the restrictions including the weight of the pet, type of carrier and other specifics.\u201d \u00a0 Finally, you\u2019ll want to ask yourself why you\u2019re bringing your pet with you. Is it for a long trip or a quick vacation? If it\u2019s the latter, your dog might be better off not travelling. \u00a0 \u201cYou know your dog better than anyone else does,\u201d says Forbes. \u201cDo an honest assessment before your trip to determine if your dog should travel and how.\u201d Some airlines only allow large dogs, often those in excess of 70 pounds, into cargo. Placing a dog into cargo is controversial, but Forbes says that, in general, flying with a dog in cargo is usually not a problem. \u00a0 Osborne, however, does not recommend flying a dog in cargo but says that pet owners who opt to go this route need to take extra precautions. It\u2019s best to fly with dogs in cargo in spring or fall, on direct flights and at non-peak times, she says. Flat-nosed dogs, such as Pugs and French Bulldogs, should never fly in cargo. \u00a0 \u201cAlways ask if flowers will be shipped on the same flight,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey are packed in dry ice and those fumes can be toxic.\u201d \u00a0 Make sure your dog\u2019s name, photo and all of your contact information is on the crate or carrier that your dog will be flying in. Always carry your dog\u2019s recently-issued health certificate, says Osborne, as some airlines require a health certificate dated within ten days of travel. Also, check to see if the state or country you visit requires special vaccinations, laboratory tests, or a quarantine period. \u00a0 No matter how your dog travels, he should be wearing a collar with his identification on it, and keep a recent photo of our dog on your phone in case of emergency, says certified professional trainer Nicole Ellis. Microchips linked to current contact information are also a good idea. Airlines have specific rules about what pet carriers can and can\u2019t be used on a flight. Check with your airline for specifics. Remember that your dog should be able to lie down, sit, stand up and turn around in the carrier, says Osborne. \u00a0 If you opt to bring your dog on a leash, always bring an extra one in case of emergencies, says Ellis. In addition, Ellis always checks all of her luggage when she travels with a dog. That way she can concentrate on the dog\u2019s safety and comfort. Once you select the crate or carrier you\u2019ll be transporting your dog in, work on making him comfortable getting in and out of it ahead of time. \u00a0 \u201cTeach the dog to go into the carrier, then slide it under a coffee table and read the paper for ten minutes. Then slide it out,\u201d Forbes says. \u201cYou want your dog to feel that getting in and out of the carrier is normal and even fun. We underestimate how simple it is to train a dog and create a positive association.\u201d \u00a0 You\u2019ll also want to get your dog used to the sights and sounds of an airplane and airport. Take him to the airport in his carrier if you\u2019re able to and sit in the public waiting area so he can experience the environment, Ellis says. If that\u2019s not possible, Osborne recommends finding audio of airplane and airport noise to play for the dog. Supplies are key to a happy, healthy trip. Here\u2019s what Ellis recommends bringing: \u00a0 Your dog\u2019s food\u00a0 Treats\u00a0 Collapsible food and water bowls.\u00a0 An extra leash\u00a0 Plastic bags and hand cleaners in case of accidents.\u00a0 A safe toy or bone for chewing on during the flightAccording to Osborne, giving your dog a sedative or medication before flying is not recommended. \u201cThey cause a drop in blood pressure and heart rate and make the pet unsteady,\u201d she says. \u201cAsk your vet to recommend holistic alternatives such as essential oils made specifically for pets.\u201d If your dog is so anxious or rambunctious that you feel a sedative will absolutely be required, you probably need to reconsider whether putting him on a plane is in his best interests."}]
