But they might overlook the need for mental stimulation, which is also crucial for a dog\u2019s well-being. Why Is Mental Stimulation Important for Dogs? Dogs are incredibly smart animals, so mental stimulation is just as important for them as physical exercise. Mental exercises can actually make dogs even more tired than physical exercise. This is especially important for high-energy working dog breeds such as German Shepherds, Border Collies, Australian Shepherds, and Australian Cattle Dogs. In fact, many destructive behaviors in dogs can be resolved simply by implementing mental exercises every day. Some of the many benefits of mental stimulation are: Improving mental health Improving cognitive function Building confidence Releasing stress Helping to eliminate destructive behaviors Decreasing hyperactivity Tiring a dog out Improving brain development in puppies Keeping dogs happy Strengthening our bond with them Is Your Dog Bored? Dogs are pack animals who were originally bred to perform jobs. But now, most of them don\u2019t have a job to do (even if they want one!) and they spend a lot of time alone when their human parents are gone. It\u2019s only natural that they would get bored. Signs your dog may be experiencing boredom include: Chewing up furniture, pillows, trash, toilet paper, etc., while you\u2019re gone Knocking over the trash Digging holes in the yard Overexcitement when you come home Persistently begging for attention Acting restless Excessive licking Escaping/running away from home Barking excessively Pacing Chasing their tail Fighting with other pets in your household Some of these signs can also be associated with separation anxiety or other behaviors or disorders. Talk to your veterinarian to help determine the root cause of your pet\u2019s behaviors. How To Keep Your Dog Engaged  While it\u2019s stressful to worry that your pup may be bored, there are countless ways to keep your dog mentally stimulated and happy. The best part? Many of them are free (or very inexpensive). 1. Play Hide-and-Seek Just like people, dogs can find hide-and-seek to be great fun. This is easiest to do if your dog knows \u201cstay\u201d or if you have a friend who can help keep the dog in one room while you hide. Once you\u2019re hidden, call your pup to come find you. Playing hide-and-seek requires two things from your dog: critical thinking skills and a good nose. In a home setting, dogs don\u2019t need to use these skills as often, and having the opportunity to use them is lots of fun for them. 2. Go \u201cFind It\u201d \u201cFind it\u201d is a great alternative to hide-and-seek. First, put your dog in another room or a crate. While he\u2019s confined, hide toys or treats (whichever your dog prefers) around the house. When you go back to release your dog, allow him to smell your hand for the scent of what you hid, and tell him to go \u201cfind it.\u201d Start easy with the treat/toy in an obvious place. As he starts to understand the game, you can progressively make it harder. This provides the same benefits as hide-and-seek, but it can be easier to play alone with your pup. 3. Take a Scent Walk Set aside specific walks where you allow your dog to take his time, explore wherever he\u2019d like to go, and sniff all the smells. Sniffing has been shown to not only decrease a dog\u2019s heart rate (decreasing their stress), but it also releases dopamine, the \u201chappy\u201d brain chemical. These walks are less about the distance or time and more about quality, allowing them to take their time and explore the area they\u2019re in. Some of the best settings for these walks have lots of grass, bushes, and trees.\u00a0 4. Try a New Route Have you ever gotten bored doing the same thing over and over again? Dogs do too. This is why changing up your walking route can be very stimulating for them. Walking somewhere new allows them to see and smell new things. Regularly changing your route helps keep things exciting for your dog\u2014which is mentally stimulating. 5. Play With Puzzles and Interactive Toys Puzzle toys and other interactive toys typically have compartments where you can hide food, and your dog has to figure out how to access those tasty treats. There are countless puzzle toys, all with varying degrees of complexity. Similar to hide-and-seek and \u201cfind it,\u201d interactive toys require critical thinking skills. They\u2019re great for keeping your pup occupied for an extended time, distracting him from things that make him anxious, and mentally exhausting him. Dogs also receive a food reward when they play, leading to a dopamine release. As a bonus, puzzle toys are a great way to slow down dogs that eat their food too fast. 6. Munch on Frozen Treats Frozen treats are perfect for keeping your pup mentally stimulated year-round\u2014but especially in summer. There are all sorts of pupsicle recipes you can make for your dog, and you can also give them plain frozen fruits and veggies (such as carrots) as a treat. Frozen treats give your dog something yummy to eat, but they also take a bit of work (hence why they\u2019re mentally stimulating). Because the food is frozen, dogs usually end up licking it until it melts. This provides them a fair amount of entertainment while they\u2019re trying to eat. 7. Scatter Feeding Scatter feeding is where you take portions of your pet\u2019s dry food and hide them around the house. Put your dog in one room, hide the food in small piles around the house or yard, then release him to go find it all. Like other feeding exercises and games, this requires mentally stimulating nose work. Snuffle mats are similar to scatter feeding, but the food is all kept on one mat that has ruffles and pockets that hide the food. Your dog will then have to use his nose to sniff out the food between the fabric.\u00a0 8. Practice Training Training is a phenomenal way to mentally stimulate and exhaust your dog. It also teaches him all sorts of new tricks. Dogs like to know the rules of a household, and training not only bonds them with you, but also makes them feel more secure at home. Even just 5\u201315 minutes of training exercises a day can be exhausting for your dog. Compare it to whenever you\u2019ve tried to learn something new\u2014it\u2019s using new parts of your brain, which tires you out quickly. But when you do finally get it, you feel incredibly accomplished (thanks to a dopamine release). The same goes for our furry friends. 9. Rotate Toys From a mental perspective, dogs are very similar to children. They love their toys, but they can get bored with them over time. An easy way to keep things interesting for your dog is to leave out only a few toys at a time and keep the rest hidden. Then, switch out and rotate the toys he has access to. This simple trick keeps your dog\u2019s toys exciting and helps prevent boredom. Each week feels like he\u2019s getting the toys for the first time. While this list provides several examples of ways to keep your pup mentally stimulated, ultimately, anything you can think of that changes things up for your pup\u2014or that requires their brain power\u2014can be a great way to keep him mentally stimulated and happy. Use your creativity to make up your own games or mentally stimulating activities for you and your pup! Featured Image: Adobe/Eva"}]
