Dogs are irresistible, after all, but you should always use caution before approaching any dog. Making contact with a service dog, in particular, can inadvertently place his person at risk. Learning proper service dog etiquette can prevent mishaps and help human handlers preserve the special bond they have with their animals. What Is a Service Dog, and How Can You Identify Them? The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) considers an ADA service dog as one who\u2019s been specifically trained to assist a person with a disability. In most cases, trained service dogs are required to be tethered, leashed or harnessed while in public. Although the ADA doesn\u2019t require it, service dogs often wear vests or patches, like the Doggie Stylz do not pet dog patch. How Service Dogs Differ From Companion Dogs \u201cService dogs are only different from companion dogs in the training they receive and that their behavior is to always be amicable towards other people and other animals. This means too, that they cannot get distracted from their work,\u201d says Mark Castillero, director of Pro-Train in the San Diego, California area. While any breed can become a service dog, it\u2019s essential that he not have behavioral issues, be aggressive or fearful, says Marsha Tonkinson, owner and lead trainer of K9 Paws Behavior Dog Training\u00a0in Golden Valley, Arizona. The dogs go through extensive training that experts say can last from several months to two years. The length of the training period depends on the dog\u2019s age and how much training he\u2019s already received. \u201cIn addition to learning basic obedience and leash manners, the dog should be able to pass a public-access test, and be trained to perform work or a specific task for their human,\u201d says Morgan Karol, dog training manager with Freedom Service Dogs of America based in Englewood, Colorado. Service Dogs Are Lifelines for\u00a0People With Disabilities Guiding a blind person, alerting a patient to low blood sugar, or preventing someone with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or autism from performing a destructive behavior, are examples of life-saving tasks service dogs perform,\u201d says Karol. Trainers say the dogs are lifelines for people with disabilities. \u201cTo watch a person who wouldn\u2019t really leave their home from fear, to getting a service dog and watching them getting involved in their community helping others, is the greatest thing ever,\u201d says Tonkinson. Learning to Respect Boundaries To be a lifeline to a disabled person, a service dog needs to be able to focus on his job. Trainers are adamant that people should ignore service dogs completely\u2014no petting, calling or staring. \u201cI wish people would just smile at the handler and move on. We see more adults acting up than kids out in public. Treat the service dog team with respect and think, \u2018If this was my loved one, how would I feel if a stranger ran up to the dog and was talking to the dog in baby talk and making kissy sounds?\u2019\u201d says Tonkinson. She adds that people make assumptions of what a disabled person looks like, and will even question the handler. \u201cPeople need to understand that most disabilities are invisible.\u201d \u201cDistracting service dogs is an issue,\u201d says Karol.\u00a0\u201cThe interference we receive as service dog trainers on a daily basis while we are in public training these dogs, is immense.\u00a0We know our clients face this struggle as well.\u00a0A simple task, such as going to the grocery store, can take much, much longer than it should when a person working with a dog is constantly interrupted with questions, comments, stories and requests to pet the dog.\u201d Consequences of Not Following Proper Service Dog Etiquette By distracting a service dog, you could literally be putting someone\u2019s life in danger, says Karol. \u201cIt may prevent them from alerting their person to a drop in blood sugar or a seizure.\u00a0It may be that person\u2019s first time in a public place in five years, and they are doing everything they can to complete a task or errand, and your interference could set them back immensely.\u201d Picture a scenario in which a service dog is walking down a busy sidewalk, focusing on keeping his human safe, when someone stops to pet him, offers Castillero. \u201cThe dog most likely will smash its handler into some obstacle or pole instead of clearing its handler around it. And the blind person most likely had no idea that someone was distracting his dog.\u201d In some cases, the service dog may have to reenter training or be rendered unable to work. This can result in a loss of thousands of dollars and hours of training, says Tonkinson. Service dogs help people with disabilities to stay healthy, survive and even thrive. In order for this relationship to work, the dog has to stay focused. Proper service dog etiquette boils down to respecting these boundaries."}]
