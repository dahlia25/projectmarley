It's best to choreograph all of their interactions as they get used to each other. On the day you bring your new dog home. Start off by going to a neutral location and doing parallel walking.\n\nGet a friend or family member to help out. You're basically walking both dogs about 20 feet apart from each other double back on the areas that you've already crossed. So the dogs can actually catch each other's scent. Now pay close attention to their body language.\n\nYou're looking for loose happy curiosity about each other with no tension hard stares or high tails if they seem relaxed you can slowly close the distance between them, allowing them to meet. Keeping the leash is loose at the same time. Praise all appropriate interactions then go back to your yard and do an abbreviated version of parallel walking with both dogs when their body language tells you that they're getting along. You can drop the leashes and allow them to play.\n\nAllow your new dog some time to explore his home before you let your resident dog back inside. Make sure to pick up any resources that could cause a scuffle between them like bones toys or half filled food bowls. Then once your new dog has had a chance to survey his new home you can let your resident dog back in. It's helpful to give both dogs alone time during the transition.\n\nYou can set up a quiet room for your new dog where he can go to relax or if he's comfortable. Use a crate. This gives both dogs a chance to relax. You can also put up a baby gate so they can get used to each other slowly on their own time.\n\nEven if your new dog and your resident dogs seem like the best of friends from the very first day it's still a good idea to separate them when they eat. You can either use a baby gate or just close the door between them so they can eat in peace until they learn to understand each other. Try to acknowledge positive encounters between your dogs. If your new dog offers a play about to your resident dog as an invitation to play praise that behavior.\n\nIf your resident dog sits quietly beside your new dog praise that as well. This type of feedback helps your dogs understand the behaviors that you appreciate it. Finally to be 100% safe always separate your dogs when you leave the house and you can't supervise them. You can use a baby gate or crates if your dogs are comfortable in them Follow these tips and before you know it your new dog and your resident dog will be best.", "potentialAction": {"@type": "SeekToAction", "target": "https://www.petmd.com/dog/training/evr_introducing_a_new_dog_to_a_resident_dog?wtime={seek_to_second_number}", "startOffset-input": "required name=seek_to_second_number"}}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "BreadcrumbList", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 0, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.petmd.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Training & Behavior", "item": "https://www.petmd.com/dog/behavior"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "Article", "headline": "How to Introduce Dogs the Right Way", "inLanguage": "en-US", "isFamilyFriendly": "True", "isAccessibleForFree": "True", "articleSection": "Pet Care Center", "thumbnailUrl": "https://image.petmd.com/files/styles/863x625/public/dogs-meeting-picture-id900016076.jpg", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://image.petmd.com/files/styles/863x625/public/dogs-meeting-picture-id900016076.jpg"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "PetMD Editorial", "url": "https://www.petmd.com"}, "keywords": "Dog, Training, Behavior", "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "PetMD", "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.petmd.com/images/petmd_logo.png"}, "url": "https://www.petmd.com"}, "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.petmd.com/dog/training/evr_introducing_a_new_dog_to_a_resident_dog"}, "datePublished": "March 18, 2020", "dateModified": "September 6, 2022", "description": "How do you introduce a new dog to your longtime canine friend? Here are some steps you can follow and helpful tips for introducing dogs.", "articleBody": "Reviewed on March 18, 2020, by Dr. Alison Gerken, DVM, and Victoria Schade, dog trainer Introducing a new dog to your family dog is sure to spur a mix of nervousness and excitement. In order to make the transition smooth, you should plan each step of the process\u2014from the dogs\u2019 first meeting to the steps you\u2019ll take to keep the peace for the first few months. The first step toward ensuring a lifelong doggy friendship is for you to have a plan and a calm approach.\u00a0\u00a0 Steps for Introducing a New Dog to Your Current Dog\u00a0 If you know how to introduce dogs properly, you\u2019ll set them both up to make a good first impression. Follow these steps for introducing dogs to each other. 1. Find a Neutral Spot to Make Introductions If possible, find a neutral, outdoor, fully fenced space\u2014an area that neither dog has \u201cclaimed\u201d through frequent visits or walks. The space should be quiet with no other dogs or people, like the backyard of a friend who doesn\u2019t have pets or a park during off hours when no one is there. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t always possible, so the next best option is an outdoor space with enough room for the dogs to roam on-leash as they get to know one another. If outdoor space isn\u2019t available, opt for a large garage or basement. Put away anything that might cause a scuffle\u2014like dog toys, bones, beds, and even empty\u00a0food bowls. Consider everything, including objects that don\u2019t seem to interest your dog. An old bone might suddenly become valuable again if your new dog takes an interest in it. 2. Watch for Positive Dog Body Language Since the dog introduction process begins with both dogs on-leash, you\u2019ll need a partner that understands\u00a0canine body language\u00a0to help out. Watch the dogs for happy, waggy body language and interest in one another without hard stares, tense postures, freezing in place, or a lowered or tucked tail.\u00a0 Look for signs that one dog is trying to get away, which are often missed or misinterpreted. If your dog runs over to you, don\u2019t send them back \u201cinto the fire\u201d because this is usually an indication that your dog needs a break from the interaction.\u00a0 If you\u2019re not comfortable with how the dogs are interacting during this first step, or you\u2019re unsure of what your dogs\u2019 behaviors mean, enlist the help of a trainer during the introduction process. 3. Walk the Dogs Together After introducing a new dog, the next step is parallel walking with both dogs. They should be far enough apart that they\u2019re aware of each other, but not so close that they fixate on trying to reach one another. Walk both dogs in the same direction with a comfortable\u00a0buffer\u00a0of distance between them (this will vary by dog). Then, turn back and trade places with the other dog-human team so that each dog has a chance to scent where the other dog walked. Allow the dogs to investigate potty spots, since urine-sniffing is one of the ways dogs pick up information about other dogs. Both handlers should remain calm and keep their grip on the leashes\u00a0as loose as possible. If both dogs are offering relaxed, social behaviors towards one another, gradually decrease the distance between them while continuing the parallel walking. Don\u2019t allow a direct face-to-face approach as the dogs get closer, since head-on is a stressful and unnatural way for dogs to meet. 4. Allow the Dogs to Interact Off-Leash If you feel comfortable with how the dogs are interacting, return to an enclosed area, drop the leashes, and allow them to interact. Give the dogs a few minutes to sniff one another while praising their calm interactions, and then encourage the dogs to continue moving with you for a final, brief walk together. At this point, the dogs might continue sniffing to learn more about each other, or they might begin playing. Look for the universal dog invitation to connect: a play bow where dogs put their elbows on the ground and rear end in the air.\u00a0 As the dogs play, watch for the signs of a respectful interaction: a mutual give-and-take with pauses in the action.\u00a0 Introducing a New Dog to Your Home After you introduce your new dog to your resident pet, you can introduce your new dog to your home. Instead of bringing both dogs inside right away, you should have a helper take your resident dog for a stroll. Then give your new dog a chance to check out his new living space alone. Keep an eye on your new dog as he investigates. When he\u2019s checked everything out, bring him to an open area of your home, away from the front door. Cramped spaces can lead to jockeying for position and accidental scuffles. Once again, pick up any dog toys, treats, beds, prized possessions, or food that could create tension between the dogs. Then you can have your helper bring your resident dog inside. Daily Life After Introducing a New Dog Try to keep your household calm as the dogs\u00a0acclimate\u00a0to one another. Don\u2019t throw a \u201cwelcome to the family party\u201d on the first day home.\u00a0 Maintain your resident dog\u2019s typical daily schedule, and try to set aside one-on-one time with each dog, like going for solo walks. Always be aware of signs of brewing tension between your dogs, like low growling, hard stares, and body blocking. If you notice any of these signs, you should intervene immediately.\u00a0 Separate the dogs and direct their attention to something else. Give them a break from one another for at least 20-30 minutes before allowing them to engage again.\u00a0 Here are some more important tips for keeping the peace after introducing dogs: Monitor Mealtimes Always separate your new dog and resident dog during mealtimes. You can either place their bowls in different rooms or use a\u00a0dog gate\u00a0to separate them.\u00a0 If one dog finishes first, don\u2019t allow him to hover as the other dog eats. To prevent tension, you should keep them apart until both dogs have licked their bowls clean. Always pick up the bowls\u00a0after feeding time. Give Each Dog Their Own Bed Some dogs are possessive of their resting spaces, so watch to make sure both dogs are acting appropriately around their beds. Even if a bed is big enough for both dogs to share, it\u2019s a good idea to get a different bed for your new dog.\u00a0\u00a0 Introduce Toys Slowly Introduce toys back into the house slowly after the first introduction rather than bringing out the entire toy chest right away. Always supervise your dogs when they are trying out a new toy.\u00a0 Look for playful interactions without signs of guarding, like standing over the toy or snapping at the other dog if he gets too close to it. Separate the Dogs When You\u2019re Away\u00a0 Alone time is an important aspect of the getting-to-know-you process. Whether you\u2019re leaving the house for the day or just taking a shower, always separate your dogs when you can\u2019t watch them. This obviously keeps them safe, but it also provides them with downtime apart from one another. In the long-term, it is always wise to supervise them together and separate them when no one is home. This will keep everyone safe and interactions more positive. Create Playtime Breaks Many dogs don\u2019t understand when to say \u201cwhen,\u201d particularly if they\u2019re having a good time together.\u00a0 But that nonstop play can tip over into inappropriate behavior when dogs get overtired. Giving your dogs a break from one another allows them to relax and regroup.\u00a0 Create spaces for each dog so that they can be separated\u2014either in different rooms or behind a dog gate. Dogs needs a break from their housemates, just like all of us do.\u00a0 Have Patience It can take months before your new dog and resident dog mellow into true comfort with one another, so have patience with them as they get used to siblinghood. Always acknowledge positive interactions between your dogs and enjoy watching the lifelong friendship bloom. Featured Image: iStock.com/YuriyS"}]
