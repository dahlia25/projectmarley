But in the rush to share the festivities with your beloved canine, you want to make sure that pet safety doesn\u2019t take a back seat to fun. \u201cMy feeling about taking your dog to a street festival is the same as taking your dog to a dog park,\u201d says Dr. Jeff Werber, DVM in Los Angeles. \u201cThe most important thing is that the dog is okay with people and with other dogs.\u201d If he\u2019s not, he\u2019ll be happier staying at home. Dog safety, health and enjoyment should be pet owners\u2019 main consideration when deciding whether their dogs attend public events. And that truly depends on the individual animal. If you think your dog would enjoy it, or if happenstance finds you at an event with your dog by your side, here are the steps you should take to ensure pet safety. Buckle Your Dog Up If you\u2019re driving to the event, secure your dog, says Amy Burkert, author of the book \u201cThe Ultimate Pet Friendly Road Trip.\u201d \u201cIt is terrifying to me how few people have their pets buckled up in their vehicles.\u201d Buckling a dog into a dog car seat minimizes driver distraction, ensures the dog remains safe and protects people, says Burkert, who lives with her husband and two dogs in an ever-moving RV. Burkert, founder of GoPetFriendly.com, says, \u201cHaving them buckled up also ensures they don\u2019t jump out of the car when you stop and get lost or leap into traffic and cause accidents.\u201d Feel the Heat You may think that nice weather is ideal for a walk through a festival or outdoor event with your dog, but you should stop and feel the sand, pavement, etc., with your hand. If it is burning or uncomfortable, it\u2019s too hot for your dog, says the Emmy Award-winning Dr. Jeff Werber, who hosted \u201cPetcetera\u201d\u00a0on\u00a0Animal Planet and\u00a0\u201cLassie\u2019s Pet Vet\u201d\u00a0on\u00a0PBS.\u00a0 Pavement and asphalt retain heat after the sun sets, so you should check the temperature no matter the time of the day and at night, he adds. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many dogs I\u2019ve seen on beaches with no umbrellas, no dog booties and no hydration,\u201d says Dr. Werber. \u201cThat\u2019s unfair to the dog and can make [him] ill.\u201d Dogs who are out in the summer need plenty of water and plenty of shade, advises Dr. Werber. \u201cTake plenty of breaks and check their feet,\u201d he adds. \u201cIf they are panting or agitated, it might be too hot for them. It\u2019s time to go home.\u201d Control Your Dog \u201cBe sure your pets have well-fitting collars with up-to-date ID tags just in case your pet gets lost,\u201d says Dr. Carol Osborne, DVM at Chagrin Falls Veterinary Center and Clinic in Ohio. \u201cToday, in addition to permanently identifying your pet with a collar or microchip, newer services geared to help locate lost pets include Pet Amber Alert and pet GPS.\u201d Some dog experts recommend that owners only use a non-retractable dog leash, especially at large outdoor events. To help ensure dog safety, it is important to closely control your dog while around large crowds. A dog on a retractable leash can get tangled around objects or people, which may lead to injury, or at the very least, a potentially unpleasant situation. You May Love a Parade, But Your Dog Doesn\u2019t \u201cEven the most gregarious, socialized pet shouldn\u2019t go to a parade,\u201d says Russell Hartstein, certified pet behaviorist and CEO of FunPawCare in Los Angeles. \u201cNo dog loves to do those things. Some will behave if they are forced to go, but that doesn\u2019t mean they thrive or enjoy it. People become intoxicated, step on the dog\u2026 It\u2019s only a matter of time before a dog might growl or bite because they are stressed and overwhelmed.\u201d Hartstein recommends against taking dogs to public events like festivals. Dogs and other animals can also be fearful of loud noises and other boisterous forms of human entertainment, like fireworks. \u201cLoud noises scare pets and most dogs and\u00a0cats\u00a0do NOT enjoy fireworks,\u201d says Dr. Osborne. \u201cLeaving pets home during fireworks is wise. Pet ears are far more sensitive to loud noises than ours.\u201d To keep your pet calm during loud noises at home, have your pet listen to classical music, which has been shown to reduce canine anxiety. Pet ThunderShirts are also an option to help comfort stressed dogs. In extreme situations, your veterinarian can recommend dog anxiety medication, supplements and behavioral modification techniques that will help your dog deal with loud noises. Watch What Your Dog Eats Most people like barbeques, but the combination of foods, beverages and grills can prove unsafe or deadly, says Dr. Osborne. Beer, wine and alcohol can lead to life-threatening seizures and/or respiratory failure in dogs and\u00a0cats, says Dr. Osborne, so take special care that they are well out of reach. It\u2019s also wise to keep dogs away from the grill. Obviously, fire is a hazard, but so are unlit matches and lighter fluid if they are ingested. According to the ASPCA, both might contain chlorates, which can potentially damage blood cells and result in respiratory issues and even kidney damage in severe cases. The ASPCA also says, lighter fluid is irritating to skin and can cause gastrointestinal irritation and central nervous system depression in dogs. Inhaling lighter fluid can leave your pet vulnerable to pneumonia. Many types of human food can make dogs ill, adds Dr. Osborne. \u201cBarbecues are tantalizing,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, keeping your pet\u2019s meals and snacks as close to normal as possible helps avoid upset stomachs, vomiting, diarrhea and emergency room issues like pancreatitis.\u201d Having fun with your dog might involve some outdoor dog activities in public venues, but make sure your pet\u2019s safety and health come first."}]
