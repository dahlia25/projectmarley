Learn how to find the perfect dog seat covers for your car.", "articleBody": "Image via iStock.com/N8tureGrl By Diana Bocco If traveling with dogs is part of your routine, you probably already know how quickly dirt and dog hair can accumulate in your car. Using a back seat dog cover\u00a0is not only great for protecting your car against the elements, but it can actually make driving with your dog safer for both you and your pet. Here are five things to keep in mind when choosing the best dog car seat cover\u00a0for your traveling needs. Opt for Water-Resistant If Your Dog Loves the Outdoors Taking dogs out in inclement weather (rain or snow) or taking dogs to the beach are just a few instances where a water-resistant dog cover for car seats\u00a0is great to have, according to Katherine Hanscom, customer service supervisor for Kurgo Products. \u201cWater-resistant\u00a0seat\u00a0covers make the most sense any time you\u2019re traveling with dogs (and human kids), because dogs get dirty and liquid messes happen,\u201d says Hanscom. Waterproof or water-resistant materials also make for the best rear seat cover dogs\u00a0because they are easier to clean, according to Natalie Le, a representative for Pet Magasin customer service. Pick Quilted Materials for Comfort and Durability Quilted dog car seat covers are made with a heavyweight material that is strong and durable, especially for dogs that scratch or chew on it, according to Le.\u00a0 If you\u2019re looking for a soft and smooth material that doesn\u2019t trap hair, Hanscom recommends loft-quilted back seat dog covers like the Kurgo loft dog hammock because it\u2019s easy to shake dirt and hair off them, and they wash well. \u201cI would recommend it to anybody who is looking for a soft material versus one with a more \u2018canvas-like\u2019 texture.\u201d \u00a0 Choose a Hammock-Style Cover for Max Protection Hammock-style dog seat\u00a0covers\u00a0are a great option for pet parents looking for a seat\u00a0cover that protects the back of the front seats, the foot wells and the bench seat, according to Hanscom. \u201cThey can help prevent a dog from falling into the foot wells and offer a soft barrier that may keep some dogs contained in the back\u00a0seat,\u201d says Hanscom. \u00a0\u00a0 Hammock-style covers also give better protection if you have to stop suddenly or in the case of an accident, adds Le. The safest options are those, like the Pet Magasin blue hammock style car seat cover, that have buckle slits to allow you to easily attach your dog\u2019s Kurgo direct to\u00a0seat-belt tether. And while they work great for daily use, Le points out that covers are especially great for long road trips. \u201cThey prevent the car from being covered in fur everywhere, as well as dirty or muddy footprints, and claw marks on leather upholstery,\u201d Le says. \u00a0\u00a0 Finally, hammocks like the K&amp;H Pet Products car seat saver are also a deterrent for dogs jumping over the\u00a0seat, according to Fara Erspamer, director of product development and design for K&amp;H Pet Products.\u00a0\u201cAlong with cell phones, pets are a distraction while operating a motor vehicle,\u201d says Erspamer. \u00a0\u00a0 Go With the Right Materials Bench-seat\u00a0covers like the Kurgo extended width dog bench seat cover can be a good option for larger dogs and for pet parents who are looking for a more \u201ctailored look/fit\u201d in their\u00a0seat\u00a0cover, says Hanscom. When it comes to price and look, it\u2019s all about what you\u2019re comfortable with. For example, Hanscom points out that, generally speaking, the canvas-like covers\u00a0tend to be the most durable choice for larger, active dogs. \u00a0 And if you have a large dog, Le adds that the strong, heavyweight, waterproof fabric is better because it will stand up to dog paws and toenails, even if your pet is scratching at the seat. If you have a relatively quiet pet, a simple dog cover for car seats\u00a0may do the trick most of the time, except if you\u2019re planning an outdoor adventure that might involve getting wet, according to Erspamer.\u00a0\u201cWaterproof covers protect from stains, spills and dirt, including muddy paws,\u201d says Erspamer. \u201cEven our micro-suede covers are quilted with a water-resistant backing that will protect from spills, muddy paws and dirt.\u201d Make Sure You Get the Right Fit Although dog car seat covers are designed to fit most cars, trucks and SUVs, there are a couple of different sizes available. The best way to determine which size\u00a0car\u00a0seat\u00a0cover will fit is to measure the width of the seating area of your rear bench\u00a0seat\u00a0from door to door, says Hanscom.\u00a0 Most\u00a0car\u00a0seat\u00a0covers\u00a0are either 54 inches or 57 inches\u2014and it depends on the type of vehicle, according to Erspamer.\u00a0\u201cAlways measure across the longest part of the rear\u00a0seat,\u201d Erspamer says. \u201cMost midsize SUVs, crossovers and standard cars are 54 inches; large, full-size SUVs and trucks are 57 inches.\u201d"}]
