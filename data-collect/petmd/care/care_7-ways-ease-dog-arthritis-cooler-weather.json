Here a few ways that you can help ease dog arthritis symptoms during the winter time.", "articleBody": "Reviewed and updated for accuracy on November 26, 2018, by Katie Grzyb, DVM If you live with an arthritic dog, you know all too well that cooler weather can aggravate her symptoms. While there is no cure for arthritis in dogs, there are actionable, vet-recommended steps you can take to help relieve the pain, stiffness, joint popping and other dog arthritis symptoms. Because your pup has specific health needs, always discuss any new treatment options with your veterinarian. Here are seven things you can do to help a dog with arthritis. 1. Manage Your Dog\u2019s Weight Veterinarians say weight control is one of the most important tools for managing arthritis in dogs. \u201cThe heavier our pets are, the more stress that gets placed on their joints. Studies have shown that keeping your dog lean can improve mobility and exercise tolerance,\u201d says Dr. Liliana Mutascio, a veterinary surgeon with VetMed in Phoenix, Arizona. How can you tell if your pup is overweight? Dr. Mutascio says that \u201cIdeally, you should be able to easily feel your pet\u2019s ribs, and your pet should have a natural waistline when viewed from above and from the side.\u201d Having your veterinarian perform regular weight and body condition scoring checks is ultimately the best way to monitor her weight. When consulting with your veterinarian about your dog\u2019s diet, ask about dog hip and joint care dog food, like Hill\u2019s Prescription Diet j/d joint care or Purina Pro Plan Veterinary Diets JM joint mobility. Dr. Mutascio says prescription dog food\u00a0contains ingredients like fish oil that has omega-3 fatty acids for joint health. \u201cThere is some evidence that animals on these types of diets are more comfortable and require less anti-inflammatory medication.\u201d 2. Get Your Dog Moving Movement can provide pain relief for dogs with arthritis, says Dr. Elizabeth Knabe, a veterinarian with Wildwood Animal Hospital and Clinic in Marshfield, Wisconsin. \u201cDogs that move less due to arthritis get into a cycle of pain, causing less motion that then leads to stiffness. The stiffness makes it harder to move, which causes more pain.\u201d Arthritic dogs should avoid high-impact activities like running, jumping and rough playing, says Dr. Mutascio, whose clinical interests include orthopedic surgery. \u201cInstead, consistent and regular low-impact activities like leash walks and swimming can help avoid additional joint damage, as well as improve mobility. You should strive to achieve the same level of activity each day and avoid overdoing it on weekends.\u201d If your dog is small or thin-haired, she may benefit from wearing a dog coat\u00a0or dog sweater\u00a0when it\u2019s cold outside, says Dr. Jo Ann Morrison, a board-certified veterinary internist with Banfield Pet Hospital in the Portland, Oregon area. \u201cBut be careful when putting it on or taking it off, especially if you have to manipulate your dog\u2019s legs. Consider coats or sweaters with Velcro attachments that wrap around, which may be easier to put on and take off.\u201d (Examples are the Ultra Paws red plaid cozy dog coat and the Canada Pooch Everest explorer dog jacket.) 3. Consider Dog Supplements Dog joint supplements containing glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate for dogs have natural anti-inflammatory properties, which can help ease joint pain associated with dog arthritis, says Dr. Mutascio. The caveat is that dog supplements are not regulated by the FDA, so the amount of active ingredients can vary, she adds. \u201cNutramax Dasuquin and Nutramax Cosequin are good name brands formulated for dogs that can be purchased over the counter or from your veterinarian. A joint supplement called Adequan canine injectable for dogs is also available and can be administered by a veterinarian.\u201d Other key ingredients to look for in dog hip and joint care products\u00a0are omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA), phycocyanin and manganese, says Dr. Morrison. \u201cTalk to your veterinarian about the best options for your dog based on their unique needs and medical history, while keeping in mind that some dogs may do better on multiple supplements,\u201d she advises. 4. Ask Your Veterinarian About Arthritis Pain Relief for Dogs Some dogs may occasionally need stronger pain medicine for dog\u00a0arthritis pain, especially if they over-exert themselves, says Dr. Mutascio. \u201cA non-steroidal anti-inflammatory dog medication\u00a0called Galliprant tablets for dogs recently became available and is approved for use in dogs to treat pain and inflammation associated with arthritis. You can ask your veterinarian if this or other NSAIDs such as Rimadyl chewable tablets and Metacam (Meloxicam) oral suspension for dogs are right for your pet.\u201d Since pain killers carry side effects, she recommends avoiding long-term use. \u201cIf your pet is on long-term pain killers, it is recommended that you visit your veterinarian regularly for checkups and blood tests to screen for systemic side effects,\u201d she says. 5. Prevent Falls and Slipping Falling can be especially painful for a dog with arthritis. To help your dog rise safely, consider using a sling or a dog lifting harness\u00a0for additional support, offers Dr. Morrison. \u201cCommercially available options \u2026 exist, but a large beach towel can also serve as a sling to provide support. If a sling is used, ensure it does not interfere with your dog\u2019s ability to urinate.\u201d (One option is the GingerLead support and rehabilitation unisex dog lifting harness.) To prevent falls and slipping outdoors, provide surfaces that give your dog better traction. You should also check your dog\u2019s paws to make sure they\u2019re free of snow, ice and dirt when they make their way back inside after a trip outdoors, says Morrison. Dr. Knabe says some dogs may benefit from the increased traction that dog socks\u00a0or dog boots\u00a0can offer.\u00a0\u201cThese help arthritic dogs navigate smoother surfaces, as the rubber on the pad or nails acts like grippers we use on our shoes. These also help indoors on smooth flooring.\u201d Products like Ultra Paws durable dog boots and Doggie Design non-skid dog socks provide pets with a little extra traction so they can maneuver safely. Dog steps\u00a0and ramps can also help your pup get up onto the couch or bed safely without falling. 6. Try Physical Therapy to Relieve Arthritis in Dogs Physical therapy can relieve some of the symptoms of arthritis in dogs. A veterinary physical therapist can tailor exercises for your dog\u2019s specific needs, helping her to achieve low-impact activity levels, says Dr. Mutascio. \u201cOften, an exercise regimen can be developed for use at home, with or without regular therapy appointments. Physical therapists may recommend additional therapies such as warm compress, massage and passive range of motion to help relieve discomfort and build muscle.\u201d Other complementary treatments, like acupuncture, may also offer some relief, she says. \u201cAsk your veterinarian about where you can pursue these options for your pet.\u201d 7. Provide Comfy Bedding Comfortable bedding is important for all dogs, but is especially essential for those who suffer with arthritis, says Dr. Morrison. \u201cThis could be an orthopedic mat, a memory foam bed or an elevated platform. Some dogs prefer a low-to-the-ground option that doesn\u2019t require stepping up or over into a bed, so it may take some trial-and-error to find the best solution for your pet.\u201d (Examples of orthopedic dog beds\u00a0include the Frisco orthopedic sherpa cuddler and cushion dog and cat bed and the FurHaven plush and suede orthopedic sofa dog and cat bed.) While some dogs may enjoy additional heat, others might prefer cooler temps, says Dr. Morrison. \u201cIf using a heating pad or blanket (or heated dog bed), it is critically important to always keep it on the lowest setting, and ensure the heating element does not take up their entire bed or crate. Your pet needs to be able to quickly and easily move away from the heat if it becomes too warm. It\u2019s also imperative to ensure there is always additional bedding in between your dog and the heating element. Never allow them to lie directly on top of a supplemental heat source.\u201d If your dog has trouble going up and down staircases, be sure to set up your pet\u2019s bedding appropriately so that they can nap in a comfortable spot without climbing stairs. While these tools can provide pain relief for dogs, keep in mind that every dog has individual needs, reminds Dr. Morrison. \u201cAs such, there is no one-size-fits-all recommendation for pets with arthritis. That is why it is important to monitor and keep track of what works best for your dog, what he or she does not tolerate as well\u2014like temperature, environment and stairs\u2014and partner with your veterinarian on their long-term care.\u201d By Paula Fitzsimmons Image via iStock.com/ap-images"}]
