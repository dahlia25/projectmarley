Get a veterinarian\u2019s take on how powerful a dog\u2019s sense of smell really is.", "articleBody": "Have you ever noticed that when you are feeling fearful, your dog becomes more attentive and clingy? Have you also noticed that your dog may behave differently around people who like dogs versus people who are afraid of dogs? Dogs have an incredible sense of smell, but can they smell fear? And if so, how? Is It True That Dogs Can Smell Fear? The science is in, and the answer is a resounding YES\u2014dogs can smell fear. Dogs have olfactory superpowers that can detect a human\u2019s emotional state by the scent that a human emits. That\u2019s right\u2014you can\u2019t hide fear from dogs. They\u2019ve got your number! Until recently, the idea that dogs can smell fear was only a theory, but a study called \u201cInterspecies transmission of emotional information via chemosignals: from humans to dogs\u201d actually proves that dogs (or at least Golden Retrievers and Labrador Retrievers) can smell human emotions and respond accordingly. When a person gets scared, their sweat glands will start secreting moisture, especially in the armpits. This sweat contains chemical signals that dogs can pick up on. Can Dogs Smell the Difference Between Fear and Happiness? Researchers correctly postulated that dogs would respond differently to human odors that were emitted under different emotional states\u2014namely, fear and happiness. In the study, dogs were exposed to three stimuli\u2014their owner, a stranger (the control) and an odor dispenser. Dogs were assigned to different odor conditions randomly. They collected odors from humans in three different emotional states: fearful, happy and neutral (no sweat). The odors were collected from the armpits of random male donors who were not otherwise involved in the experiment procedures. The dogs were then observed for responses, including behaviors directed at the three targets, stress behaviors and heart rate. Researchers found that when the dogs were exposed to \u201chappy odors,\u201d they interacted more with the stranger and had lower heart rates. In contrast, when the dogs were exposed to the \u201cfear odor,\u201d they displayed more stress behaviors and had higher heart rates associated with the fight, flight or freeze response\u2014a \u00a0bodily response of the\u00a0autonomic nervous system\u00a0that is essential for adaptation and survival. The dogs also sought more reassurance from their owners and interacted with the stranger less than the dogs that were exposed to the \u201chappy odor.\u201d Researchers concluded that chemosignals\u2014odors that we emit in response to our emotional state\u2014communicate across species to dogs. So, if we are scared, they can smell it and get scared, too. What Your Dog\u2019s Senses Can Tell You About Your Own Emotions Dogs can help us recognize our own emotional states. Many people who have chronic anxiety may not even be aware that they are walking around in fight, flight or freeze mode. A dog that\u2019s in tune with how you exhibit stress or fear can help signal the onset of these emotions and help you better work through feelings of anxiety. It\u2019s also important to acknowledge that dogs can feed off of your energy. So, try to temper your mindset throughout tense situations\u2014say, like at your next vet visit\u2014to help keep your pet more at ease. Your mental health and that of your pet are both important. If you take note of how your dog is behaving, you might learn more about your own mood and mental state than expected.
