Follow these pet safety tips to make sure you\u2019re prepared for a day of fun in the sun.", "articleBody": "By Helen Anne Travis \u00a0 The beach is a place to relax and have fun. And for many pet owners, bringing your dog to the beach or taking them to a dog beach makes for an even more relaxing and fun beach day experience. But the very things that make the beach so pleasant\u2014the water, sun and sand\u2014could also prove harmful to your pet. \u00a0 Here are five pet safety tips to help keep your dog safe at the beach.\u00a0 Protect your dog from heat exhaustion and heatstroke, says Dr. Libbie Fort, a veterinarian at Pekin Veterinary Clinic in Pekin, Illinois. This is especially important during the summer months. \u201cThese conditions can be fatal,\u201d says Dr. Fort. \u00a0 To keep your dog safe, avoid the dog beach at the hottest parts of the day, and provide your pup with plenty of access to shade and fresh, cool water. Try to keep activity to a minimum, says Dr. Fort. Sure, you can play fetch with your dog\u2014just make sure they have plenty of time to rest, get out of the sun and drink water in between games. \u00a0 If your dog seems overly tired or is panting more than normal, it\u2019s a good idea to wrap up the day early and get them into the air conditioning, says Dr. Fort. \u00a0 But if your dog is exhibiting symptoms like extreme lethargy, excessive panting, red (rather than pink) mucous membranes, diarrhea and vomiting, bring them to a vet immediately. Those could be signs that the dog is suffering from extreme heat stress. Drinking salty seawater could dehydrate your dog, says Dr. Fort. Make sure to bring plenty of fresh, cool water and a portable dog water dish so your dog isn\u2019t tempted to drink from the ocean. \u00a0 Ingesting a small amount of sea water won\u2019t do any harm as long as dogs have access to fresh water, but if they swallow enough seawater, they can become seriously dehydrated. Signs include vomiting; thick, ropy saliva; and dry, tacky gums. Dr. Fort recommends establishing what your dog\u2019s saliva and gums look like under normal conditions so you can immediately recognize\u2014and hopefully prevent\u2014a potential problem at the dog beach. \u00a0 If your dog is vomiting and having trouble walking, those could be signs of severe dehydration. \u00a0 \u201cBring them to the vet immediately,\u201d says Dr. Fort. Senior dogs, puppies and those that have health problems could be especially predisposed to dehydration.\u00a0 Another pet safety item for your pre-beach to-do list is to \u201cLet your dog practice her swimming skills in a controlled environment,\u201d says Dr. Robert Trimble, co-founder and head of veterinary services at Fuzzy Pet Health in San Francisco. You want her to feel confident in the water before exposing her to the tides and currents at the beach. \u00a0 Take a look at the tide charts\u2014in some regions, the size of the waves can vary drastically based on the time of year\u2014and avoid days when the currents are strong, says Dr. Trimble. \u00a0 Consider putting even good swimmers in a flotation device, says Dr. Fort. A dog life jacket with a chin support flap and bright colors can help keep pups safe in the water. And always keep a close eye on your pup when she\u2019s off-leash. \u201cNever turn your back on the ocean,\u201d says Dr. Trimble. Dog sunscreen and wipes are specially formulated for dogs to protect your pup from the sun without exposing her to potentially harmful ingredients like zinc, which is often contained in sunscreen made for people. \u00a0 Apply dog sunscreen to areas like the nose and ears, where the fur is thinner, says Dr. Fort. \u00a0 \u201cAnything pink and hairless is at risk for sunburn,\u201d says Dr. Trimble. He recommends rubbing the dog sunscreen in thoroughly and letting it dry before bringing your dog outside. \u201dYou don\u2019t want to just slather it on and walk away.\u201d \u00a0 After your dog beach day, check your pup for signs of sunburn, including red and inflamed patches. While you\u2019re checking your dog\u2019s skin, you should also make sure their eyes weren\u2019t irritated by the sun or sand, says Dr. Fort. \u00a0 If their eyes are goopy or they\u2019re squinting more than usual, bring them to the vet. \u201cIt\u2019s better to be safe than sorry,\u201d says Dr. Fort.\u00a0 A day on the beach can expose your pet to harmful bacteria and parasites. The pools that form along the shore could be a breeding ground for bacteria that cause diseases like leptospirosis, which could lead to kidney failure, says Dr. Trimble. Don\u2019t let your dog wade through or drink from stagnant pools of water. \u00a0 There is a vaccine to help prevent leptospirosis, says Dr. Trimble. Consider talking to your veterinarian to see if it\u2019s appropriate for your pup. \u00a0 Staying up to date with dog flea and tick prevention also keeps your dogs safe if they have to walk through any woods or vegetation on their way to the dog beach. And don\u2019t forget their heartworm medicine, says Dr. Trimble. \u00a0 \u201cIt only takes one mosquito to pass heartworm disease to your dog,\u201d he says."}]
