You\u2019ll probably want to bring your dog outdoors for some fresh air, sunlight and exercise, but warmer temperatures can create certain hazards for your pet, including overheating and dehydration. Here are eight veterinarian-approved tips that will show you how to keep a dog cool in summer while enjoying some fun exercises.\u00a0 Beat the heat by limiting your dog exercising activities to the early morning or late evening hours. This is when it\u2019s most likely to be cooler outside, says Dr. Brenda Stephens, DVM, clinical associate professor at the College of Veterinary Medicine in the Department of Clinical Sciences at NC State University in Raleigh. If you\u2019re exercising outdoors with your dog, you also can try to walk him in shady areas to keep him cooler. \u00a0 Besides the temperature, be mindful of the humidity, says Dr. Stephens. It will feel hotter to the dog if the humidity is higher due to the added moisture in the air. Dr. Stephens explains that dogs cool themselves by panting. When dogs pant, they breathe out moist air and inhale dry air, and evaporation helps keep them cooler. Air that\u2019s dense with humidity is already moist and doesn\u2019t help the dog cool down.\u00a0 Another way to keep your dog cooler is to take breaks between dog exercising sessions. Be sure to find a shady area for your dog to rest and recuperate. You also can try exercising in short spurts\u2014like 10 minutes three times per day\u2014versus one long period of exercising.\u00a0 You should always have a water bottle and a collapsible dog travel bowl\u00a0(such as the Prima Pets Collapsible Travel Bowl) with you during outdoor dog exercising activities so your dog has access to cool, fresh water. Dr. Stephens suggests pausing every 15 minutes to take water breaks.\u00a0 During the summertime, outdoor surfaces can get extremely hot. Asphalt can heat up fast and can even burn your pet\u2019s paw pads. Sand also gets very hot. \u00a0 It is important to test if the surface you\u2019re walking on is too hot for your dog\u2019s paws. Dr. Stephens advises that you take your hand and place it on the sand, concrete or walkway. If you can\u2019t hold your hand to the surface for more than five seconds, it\u2019s probably too hot for your dog to walk on. You can also try using protective dog boots\u00a0made for hot weather, but if you do, Dr. Stephens says to take it slow when getting your pup used to his new shoes. \u00a0 \u201cThere are very few dogs that will acclimatize to things being on their feet right off the bat,\u201d says Dr. Stephens. Gradually get your dog used to these booties before heading out on a long walk. If it\u2019s just too hot or your dog doesn\u2019t want to exercise outdoors in the heat, you can always try some air-conditioned, indoor dog activities to help get your dog exercising. Dr. Stephens suggests using a hallway to play fetch. \u00a0 \u201cIndoor exercises can be a great alternative to overheating outside,\u201d says Dr. Deborah Linder, DVM, DACVN, head of the Tufts Obesity Clinic for Animals at the Cummings Veterinary Medical Center at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. \u201cFor smaller dogs, supervised swimming in the bathtub may be all they need.\u201d Dog pools are becoming more common, and, while not indoors, many dog parks include swimming ponds. \u00a0 \u201cAgility courses, behavioral training or dispensing toys that require some mental or physical energy are great ways to keep your pet moving and satisfied,\u201d adds Dr. Linder. If you have a brachycephalic dog (dogs with shortened nose/faces like Pugs, Boston Terriers and bulldogs), you\u2019ll want to take extra precautions when it comes to working out in the heat. These dogs can\u2019t pant and cool themselves as efficiently as other breeds because their short noses give them a shorter airway, says Dr. Stephens.\u00a0 It is important to know the signs of heatstroke in dogs so that you can make sure your pet is enjoying their outdoor time. Many dogs will stop walking, seek shady spots to rest, or walk closer to their owners if they\u2019re overexerted. \u201cLook for signs of stress, such as excessive yawning or blinking; panting or [signs of] dehydration, such as dry gums; or changes in your pet\u2019s behavior, such as walking in front of you or tugging on the leash. If your dog will allow it, you can gently work up to taking your pet\u2019s temperature with an ear thermometer yourself. The normal temperature range for dogs is 101 to 102.5,\u201d says Dr. Linder. \u00a0 \u00a0 Other signs to watch out for include vomiting and diarrhea or bright red gums or tongue, which can be a sign of a circulation problem. Dr. Linder notes that obese dogs are prone to overheating and should also be monitored carefully. If you observe these signs, it\u2019s best to get your dog to the vet. Call ahead to let the staff know that you believe your dog is overheating so they can prepare. If you sense that your dog is overheating, get your dog into an air-conditioned or cool building as soon as possible. Offer your dog a bowl of ice water to drink or cold treats like frozen peanut butter or dog popsicles, but don\u2019t force them to eat or drink if they\u2019re not interested. Putting a dog in a cool (not cold) shower may also help, but only if they seem to enjoy the experience. You can also try spritzing your pup with water or wrapping them in a cold towel, says Dr. Stephens. If their condition doesn\u2019t return to normal quickly, call your veterinarian. \u00a0"}]
