Every doodle dog is a little different, based on the dog breed that the Poodle is mixed with and whether the Poodle was a Standard, Miniature, or Toy-sized Poodle.\u00a0 Each dog also has slightly different genetic outcomes. Not only does this apply to the dog\u2019s appearance and temperament, but also to any hereditary health issues they may inherit from their parents.\u00a0 An interesting study was done on Labradoodles and Goldendoodles that compared how they expressed inherited behavior traits with the traits of purebred Standard and Miniature Poodles / Labrador Retrievers / Golden Retrievers. For Labradoodles, many of the traits were similar to the purebred parents, but they scored much lower in dog rivalry than Miniature Poodles. Goldendoodles scored much higher in aggression toward other dogs and fear of other dogs and strangers than Golden Retrievers or Miniature or Standard Poodles. 14 Most Popular Doodle Dogs Even although every dog is unique\u2014just like every human\u2014below are a few stereotypical characteristics of each doodle mix, plus fun facts and what you can typically expect.\u00a0 1.
