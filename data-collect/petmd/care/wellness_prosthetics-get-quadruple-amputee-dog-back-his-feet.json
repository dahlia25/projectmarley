Foster parents Laura and Rick Aquilina of Loveland, Colo., have been fostering Brutus and announced on April 1 that they were adopting him. It\u2019s a happy outcome for a dog whose short life has been marked by pain and uncertainty. Brutus, now two years old, suffered frostbite as a puppy after he was left outside in freezing temperatures, according to his Facebook page,\u00a0Better Paws for Brutus.\u00a0His owner/breeder then crudely amputated all four of the dog\u2019s paws. \u201cBrutus was left maimed and crippled and, due to the poor way in which this was done, he is in pain every day of his life. He cannot run and play like all puppies want to do, he can barely walk,\u201d according to the Go Fund Me Page set up to help pay for the dog\u2019s prosthetics and physical therapy. The site has raised more than $12,600. Brutus\u2019s Rescuers The dog\u2019s rough road to his new life included being put up for sale with his siblings from the back of a truck in a Wal-Mart parking lot, says Laura Aquilina. The owner/breeder gave Brutus to a family who later relinquished him to animal rescuer Laura Ornelas after deciding they couldn\u2019t take care of a crippled puppy. Meanwhile, the owner/breeder disappeared, Aquilina said.\u00a0 The Aquilinas responded to a call for help fostering Brutus. Aquilina explains that she and her husband have experience fostering special needs pets for a local rescue. \u201cI knew it would be a lot of work but I didn\u2019t understand how much work,\u201d she admits. But nine months later, the couple adopted Brutus. \u201cHe deserved a second chance,\u201d says Aquilina. \u201cHe\u2019s an awesome boy.\u201d Ornelas enlisted\u00a0OrthoPets\u00a0of Denver to create prosthetics for Brutus in 2014 to support and protect his limbs\u00a0and make his legs equal lengths. Pet orthopedics experts at Colorado State University\u2019s\u00a0James L. Voss Veterinary Teaching Hospital\u00a0agreed to provide physical therapy to help Brutus get accustomed to his new \u201cpaws.&quot;\u00a0 OrthoPets fitted Brutus with the prosthetics in 2014. He\u2019s actually the second dog OrthoPets has outfitted with four prosthetic limbs, says founder Martin Kauffman. OrthoPets makes prosthetics for pets as well as for a variety of exotic animals. Learning to Adapt Brutus received prosthetics for his rear legs first, then for his front legs several weeks later, says Aquilina. Brutus is still adapting to his new situation with the help of intensive physical therapy. \u201cNobody told Brutus these legs would help him,&quot; says Kauffman. The dog didn\u2019t know what to make of the prosthetics and it took him several months to accept the devices, he added. Brutus has had to adjust to the fact that he can\u2019t feel the ground with the prosthetics on, but overall he has handled it \u201csurprisingly well,\u201d Aquilina points out. Brutus\u2019s prosthetics continue to be fine-tuned for comfort and effectiveness, and he\u2019ll ultimately need a final set made, she explained. In spite of all that Brutus has suffered, he\u2019s a playful, smart, and affectionate dog, Aquilina says. The young dog is bursting with energy and sometimes has to be restricted from being as active as he wants to be, she says. That is, at least until he\u2019s fully used to his new paws.
