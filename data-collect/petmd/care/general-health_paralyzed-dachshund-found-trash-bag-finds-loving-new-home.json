The paralyzed dog received care from veterinarians at the University of Pennsylvania and is now in a loving home. Watch her incredible story.", "articleBody": "By Deidre Grieves No dog should have to endure what happened to Frances. The longhaired Dachshund was found in the Lawncrest neighborhood of Philadelphia\u2014put out on the streets in the freezing cold like garbage. \u201cA Good Samaritan found a dog in their neighborhood in a trash bag,\u201d says Gillian Kocher, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania SPCA (PSPCA). \u201cIt\u2019s not every day that you find a dog in a trash bag. Dogs aren\u2019t trash. They are living, breathing beings that deserve to be cared for and loved.\u201d That Good Samaritan brought Frances to an animal shelter in the city and she was eventually transferred to the care of the PSPCA. Shelter workers brought Frances to the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Ryan Veterinary Hospital where doctors quickly realized that Frances was paralyzed in her hind limbs and couldn\u2019t walk. She also couldn\u2019t feel anything in her back legs. \u201cWe know from her status\u2014and from studies of dogs\u2014that once they have lost that ability to feel, doing a large surgery isn\u2019t actually going to restore their ability to move or to walk or to feel most of the time,\u201d says Dr. Jonathan Wood, who specializes in neurology at the hospital. Wood and his team assessed that Frances\u2019 injury was an old one, and decided that the dog would be better off without surgery. After staying in the hospital to recover, the PSPCA started working to find Frances a caring, loving home. That\u2019s where Christine Gacano and her family come in. Gancano immediately fell in love with Frances and welcomed the dog into her home with open arms. \u201cI give the best to my dogs\u2014I treat them like my kids,\u201d says Gancano with tears in her eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine somebody actually doing that act of putting her in a bag and putting her out in the cold in January.\u201d Frances is fitting in nicely with the Gancano clan, which also includes two other Dachshunds. To help Frances get around, the veterinary team at PennVet made Frances a custom set of wheels so that she can walk, run, and play with her other furry family members. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how she was going to take to it, but she didn\u2019t mind at all,\u201d says Dr. Alex Tun. \u201cShe immediately started to take off down the hallway.\u201d Frances\u2019 disability presents no concern for Gancano and her family, who are thrilled to have Frances as part of their lives. \u201cEvery single day I can\u2019t wait to get up and see her in the morning,\u201d says Gancano. \u201cShe brings happiness to every single person she comes in contact with. All she wants to do is love and be loved.\u201d Frances\u2019 case is still under investigation in Pennsylvania."}]
