Dr. Sandra Mitchell explains the potential reasons behind female dogs humping other dogs, objects, and humans.", "articleBody": "Humping is normal canine behavior, and it\u2019s not limited to male dogs. Female dogs hump, too, though the behavior isn\u2019t exactly socially acceptable to us. But why do female dogs hump?\u00a0 Despite a popular myth, dogs don\u2019t hump to establish social dominance. Instead, the behavior can arise from feelings of stress or anxiety, a surge in hormones, or because it\u2019s a learned behavior (a behavior continued from previous, rewarded experiences).\u00a0 Is It Normal for Female Dogs to Hump? All dogs can and do hump, whether they are male or female. This is considered a very normal behavior, although it can be embarrassing or annoying to us humans.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s important to set expectations for our dogs so they learn what is acceptable and what is unacceptable behavior. This begins by learning to effectively read your dog\u2019s body language and communicate with them. If your dog is humping, never yell, swat, or give any attention to the behavior. The goal is to modify the behavior and not use force or punishment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s also important to recognize that humping behavior is not just sexual\u2014it can be a learned behavior that, while usually driven by hormones, can arise from stress, anxiety, and fear. Female dogs may hump just as commonly as male dogs.\u00a0 Why Female Dogs Hump There are several reasons why male or female dogs will hump, including:\u00a0 Juvenile hormone increases: Puppies that are just learning to explore the world and discovering appropriate behavior may hump quite frequently. Hyperarousal: Many dogs will respond to meeting a new dog or person by humping them or a nearby piece of furniture or toy. Under-socialized dogs may mount other dogs excessively, since they have not learned how to play well with others and can become over-aroused. Unfortunately, in some animals, this can lead to a learned behavior that can increase with anxiety and interfere with other normal routines.\u00a0\u00a0 Natural sexual behaviors: When dogs hump as part of a sexual behavior, you may also notice \u201cflirtatious\u201d behavior such as play bows and pawing. Stress and anxiety: For some dogs, humping is a natural response to stress or excitement. Dogs that have other mechanisms to deal with stress may not hump as often as dogs that don\u2019t.\u00a0 Abnormal hormone production: Humping can also indicate potential medical issues, particularly if the humping started up suddenly. If a dog starts humping suddenly, a trip to the vet is probably warranted.\u00a0 It\u2019s become a learned behavior: Many dogs will hump as an attention-seeking behavior, especially if it gets a response from their humans. Most people are not able to ignore being humped by a dog, so the behavior gets a response. Therefore, humping is a guaranteed form of attention, from a dog\u2019s perspective.\u00a0 Why Do Female Dogs Hump After Being Spayed?\u00a0 Hormones don\u2019t immediately leave a dog\u2019s body after they\u2019re spayed; it can take up to three months post-spay for a dog\u2019s hormones to do so. If your dog is humping after being spayed, it could be because of lingering hormones, or it could be because the behavior has been reinforced and learned. Why Do Female Dogs Hump Specific Things or People?\u00a0 Dogs will often pick specific things that they enjoy humping. These items can include toys, the arm of a sofa, or the leg of a person. Sometimes the choice is targeted for attention, like in humping a person. Other times, dogs just choose something nearby that is favored, or something soft. Usually, humping is just a release of pent-up energy.\u00a0 Why Do Female Dogs Hump Another Female Dog?\u00a0 A female dog humping another female dog is likely doing it out of excitement or stress, such as from resource guarding. Pet parents must identify the cause of the humping and begin behavior modification. A certified fear-free professional do trainer can help. Why Does My Female Dog Hump Male Dogs?\u00a0 Again, they may be demonstrating some excitement or stress at meeting a new dog. Why Does My Female Dog Hump Me?\u00a0 Female dogs will often hump their pet parents due to anxiety or stress, like if they\u2019re experiencing separation anxiety. After all, they are very likely to get attention every time they do it. They may also hump you out of excitement, particularly when you first come home and greet them.\u00a0 Why Do Female Dogs Hump Certain People?\u00a0 Often, dogs will hump the people that give them the biggest reaction. Some dogs that hump for attention will pick the person that responds the most, effectively rewarding the behavior.\u00a0\u00a0 Dogs may also have specific targets for their humping behavior due to stress. For example, your pup might hump another dog in your house if they are experiencing resource guarding anxiety.\u00a0 When Should You Worry About Female Dogs Humping? Humping in female dogs can be a normal behavior or caused by medical certain conditions. If your adult dog suddenly begins humping, it may be an indication of a health problem that should be checked out by a veterinarian, particularly if the dog is also\u202flicking excessively\u202fat their private areas.\u00a0 If the behavior is extremely frequent, it may have become learned. However, some dogs will appear to hump out of boredom, and this indicates that perhaps more physical and mental enrichment is needed. Other dogs will hump more if they are stressed. Looking closely at your dog\u2019s lifestyle for indications of stress may help identify the problem.\u00a0 Should You Try to Stop Your Female Dog From Humping? Even though humping is a normal behavior in female dogs, it\u2019s something most people wish to stop. There are multiple ways to discourage your dog from humping.\u00a0 First, have your female dog spayed. Not only does this have several health benefits, but it may also have the behavioral benefit of discouraging humping. Remember that it can take up to three months post-spay for the humping behavior to stop, and that behavior modification may be needed if the humping has already become a learned behavior.\u00a0\u00a0 If your dog is humping, never yell, swat, or give any attention to the behavior. The goal is to modify the behavior and not use force or punishment.Next, watch your dog closely when they are getting ready to mount someone/something. They generally will show signals such as panting, whining, or pawing. As soon as you see these warning signs, distract your dog with a toy or a training cue (such as sit, shake, lie down, etc.). The distraction must be something more high-value and rewarding to your dog than humping. Some good distractions are:\u00a0 Teaching a cue to \u201cleave it\u201d is very helpful in these types of circumstances. When your dog tries to mount something, giving the cue \u201cleave it\u201d can break the cycle.\u00a0 If your dog is mounting to get attention, do not reward them with any attention\u2014ignore them entirely in that moment. For dogs that are very persistent, working with a fear-free certified professional dog trainer may help. Featured Image: Adobe/Robert Petrovic"}]
