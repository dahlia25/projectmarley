But what about the toys we buy for our dogs\u2014are we vigilant enough about safety hazards? \u201cToys are an important part of a pet&#039;s life,\u201d explains Dr. Rory Lubold, a veterinarian with Paion Veterinary in Scottsdale, Arizona. \u201cThey serve as an\u00a0enrichment tool and source of\u00a0mental stimulation to keep our pets active and engaged.\u201d But because plastics and other materials can pose hidden dangers, he advises that you should \u201calways monitor your pets after giving them a new toy.\u201d Unlike with children\u2019s toys, there is no body that regulates the safety of dog toys. \u201cPet toys do not fall under our jurisdiction,\u201d explains Thaddeus Harrington, public affairs specialist with the US Consumer Product Safety Commission, and he notes that the only time a pet toy might be recalled is if it poses a hazard to human consumers through its intended use. That means that the onus is on the consumer to sort the safe from the unsafe, and understanding the labels can help. Some dog toys feature labels like \u201cBPA-free,\u201d \u201cphthalate-free\u201d and \u201cnontoxic,\u201d but for those who are not scientifically inclined, these terms can be confusing. So, what should pet parents look for when purchasing toys, and what should we avoid? What Is BPA? The first step to understanding labels on dog toys is decoding the terms. BPA is short for bisphenol A, a chemical used in the manufacturing of polycarbonate plastics. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), BPA is found everywhere\u2014from beverage containers and food can linings to car parts. Both humans and pets are generally exposed to it through food and drink containers. What Are Phthalates? The term \u201cphthalates\u201d refers to a group of chemicals also sometimes called \u201cplasticizers,\u201d which the CDC explains make plastics more flexible. These are found in a lot of plastic packaging, toys for children and pets, and storage containers. As with BPA, exposure to phthalates mainly comes via food and drink that has been stored in plastic containers, or through toys that are placed in the mouth. Labels that read \u201cBPA-free\u201d or \u201cphthalate-free\u201d imply that the company has tested its materials to ensure they are free of these chemicals. As Harrington explains, dog toys are not regulated\u00a0by the government, meaning there is no law requiring companies to test these toys or meet a\u00a0certain standard (unlike with children&#039;s toys).\u00a0Some companies will back up their claims with information about testing on their website, but others don&#039;t have very much information. While a label might imply that they have done testing, the best bet for pet parents is to contact the company directly.\u00a0 What Does Nontoxic Mean? Still wondering what the \u201cnontoxic\u201d label means? That one is a bit trickier. According to the Environmental Working Group, \u201cThis common marketing term implies that the ingredient or product will not harm human health or the environment.\u201d Potential Risks of BPA and Phthalates The dangers of BPA and phthalates are still relatively unknown, but one thing is clear: these chemicals are ubiquitous in the environment and our bodies. According to the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences, \u201cThe 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) conducted by the CDC found detectable levels of BPA in 93 percent of 2,517 urine samples from people 6 years and older.\u201d BPA has become a public concern in recent years due to a number of studies that have shown the chemical to be an \u201cendocrine disruptor,\u201d meaning it can alter hormones. These studies have linked BPA with fertility issues in mice (which has implications for human fertility) and altered thyroid hormone levels in pregnant women. Similarly, recent studies on phthalate exposure have indicated that it may have an impact on child development or even an increased risk of diabetes in humans. Though there is less research on the effects of these chemicals on pets, a 2013 study showed that products intended for chewing and mouthing by dogs often contained BPA and phthalates, which can, in some cases, leach out of the plastic and into dogs\u2019 saliva. A more conclusive study conducted just last year indicated that BPA in canned dog food also has an impact on pets\u2019 BPA levels, introducing changes into their gut microbiome. \u201cThe amount of BPA in canned dog food is likely more significant than the amount in toys,\u201d Dr. Lubold says, adding that \u201cThere is not a lot of data on health concerns with BPA and phthalates or other\u00a0toxins when it comes to their inclusion in toys.\u201d Because there\u2019s still so much we don\u2019t know about these chemicals, it\u2019s best to be on the safe side. \u201cAs a general rule, it would be good to avoid the additional chemicals and plasticizers whenever possible,\u201d Dr. Lubold says, but he notes that the likelihood of pet health issues from these chemicals is fairly low. \u201cMost dogs will chew toys occasionally and not ingest enough of the chemicals to be significant,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, the chemicals used can mimic estrogens and have far-reaching environmental impact.\u201d Other Dog Chew Toy\u00a0Dangers Chemicals aren\u2019t the only things to watch out for when selecting a toy for your pooch\u2014in fact, veterinarians see a fair amount of ailments related to unsafe chew toys. Dr. Rachel Barrack, a licensed veterinarian with experience in both Western and Eastern medicine and owner of Animal Acupuncture in New York City, says that rawhide chews, pig ears and bully sticks can cause gastrointestinal upset and present a choking hazard. Sticks and bones are similarly problematic, she says, as they \u201ccan fragment and cause gastrointestinal blockage or perforation, medical emergencies requiring surgical intervention.\u201d \u201cThe biggest health concern with unsafe chew toys is the ingestion of small parts,\u201d explains Dr. Lubold, who has years of experience in emergency medicine. \u201cThese pieces can become lodged in the stomach or intestines and require surgery to remove. Even toys that claim to be \u2018indestructible\u2019 may be chewed apart by some dogs. I have removed many toys from dogs from all different brands.\u201d Because of this, he stresses, look for dog toys that work with your dog\u2019s particular style of play. Dr. Barrack agrees. \u201cAny toy with small parts can be a choking hazard and/or cause intestinal obstruction.\u201d She adds that you should \u201cnot leave your pet with soft toys unattended if they tend to destroy them and rip them into little pieces.\u201d What to Look for in a Dog Toy \u201cWhen choosing chew toys for dogs, there are many options, depending on your goals,\u201d says Dr. Lubold. If your dog is an aggressive chewer and needs a hardier toy, he advises careful selection. \u201cToys that are too rigid can wear down the teeth over time or even break a tooth. A good general rule is for hard toys to be soft enough that you can press your fingernail into them and leave an indentation,\u201d says Dr. Lubold. Dr. Lubold approves of West Paw\u2019s Zogoflex Hurley, which is made from BPA-free, phthalate-free and latex-free food-grade plastic that is FDA-compliant\u2014this is an extra assurance meaning the product meets FDA guidelines for a material that comes into contact with food. If your dog likes a squeak, try the Gnawsome squeaker football dog toy, which is made from plastic that follows those same guidelines. The Nerf Dog nylon flyer works well for more athletic dogs, and it\u2019s likewise made with BPA-free, FDA-approved, tear-resistant nylon. While not all dog toy companies provide information behind their product labeling, it\u2019s worth taking a moment to investigate companies\u2019 websites for more dog toy safety information. For example, the company Planet Dog provides detailed information on its website about how its toys are made, explaining how they developed their special plastic with white olefinic oil instead of chemical softeners. Armed with a bit of information about labeling practices, chemicals and other potentially dangerous materials, you should find selecting a safe and environmentally friendly dog toy a bit easier. And don\u2019t forget to consult your four-legged friends as well: your pup\u2019s preferences and personality will go a long way in helping you make an appropriate choice. \u201cThere isn&#039;t a one-size-fits-all,\u201d Dr. Barrack says. \u201cIt is important to know your pet when selecting toys.\u201d"}]
