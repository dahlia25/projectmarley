It may also be\u00a0required\u00a0to prevent or treat health issues. However, cleaning your dog\u2019s ears can be challenging, especially if\u00a0you\u2019ve\u00a0never cleaned a dog\u2019s ears and\u00a0are not\u00a0sure what to expect.\u00a0\u00a0 Dogs produce wax in their ears just like humans and usually need periodic cleaning to\u00a0maintain\u00a0normal health. Your dog\u2019s ears may also need cleaning if\u00a0they\u00a0develop an ear infection. Since proper ear care is an essential part of caring for your beloved pet,\u00a0it is\u00a0important\u00a0that the\u00a0ear cleaning is performed correctly to prevent injury or damage to your dog\u2019s ears.\u00a0 Are You Supposed to Clean Your Dog\u2019s Ears?\u00a0 Your veterinarian can help you determine if\u2014and how often\u2014you should clean your dog\u2019s ears. Some of the factors that determine how often you clean your dog\u2019s ears include:\u00a0 Does your dog produce a lot of ear wax?\u00a0\u00a0 Do you have your dog groomed regularly?\u00a0\u00a0 Does your dog like to swim, which can cause water getting into their ears?\u00a0\u00a0 Does your dog have an underlying allergy?\u00a0\u00a0 Some dogs\u00a0do not\u00a0produce much ear wax or have lifestyles that require frequent ear cleaning. However, dogs that swim and get water into their ears, or those that get water into their ears during a bath,\u00a0will\u00a0benefit\u00a0from having their ears cleaned. Dogs with allergies and who suffer from repeat ear infections will also\u00a0benefit\u00a0from\u00a0routine ear cleaning to prevent or reduce the frequency of ear infections.\u00a0\u00a0 A good rule of thumb is to check your dog\u2019s ears for wax once a month. Bath time\u00a0provides\u00a0a great opportunity\u00a0to inspect your dog\u2019s ears. You can also\u00a0peek\u00a0at their ears when\u00a0you are\u00a0brushing them or\u00a0providing\u00a0other routine care like trimming nails.\u00a0\u00a0 A groomer may also perform a routine ear check when your dog is groomed. If you notice a buildup of wax in your dog\u2019s ear,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0time to clean them. Since dogs are all unique and can develop wax in their ears based on breed, health, and other factors, there\u00a0is not\u00a0a standard timeframe to follow for routine ear cleaning. Your veterinarian can help you\u00a0determine\u00a0a schedule that makes sense for your dog.\u00a0\u00a0 When a dog\u2019s ears are red, seem painful, or have\u00a0a bad odor, they might have an ear infection. If you spot these symptoms,\u00a0do not\u00a0attempt\u00a0to clean your dog\u2019s ears. Instead, contact your vet as soon as possible. Some ear infections can be minor, while others can be severe, and your veterinarian will guide you on the best course of treatment and follow-up care.\u00a0 There are some instances where a veterinarian will\u00a0recommend against\u00a0routine ear\u00a0cleanings. Dogs that have damage to their eardrum or severe inflammation of the ear canal may suffer further damage from ear cleaning.\u00a0\u00a0 If\u00a0you are\u00a0uncertain whether routine ear cleanings are recommended for your dog, ask your veterinarian to examine your dog\u2019s ears to\u00a0determine\u00a0if there is any reason to avoid ear cleanings. If home ear cleaning\u00a0isn\u2019t\u00a0recommended, your vet may also\u00a0provide\u00a0ear cleaning services. This may be a good\u00a0option\u00a0for dogs with an infection, other health issues, or if you are simply uncomfortable cleaning your dog\u2019s ears.\u00a0\u00a0 What Can I Use to Clean My Dog\u2019s Ears?\u00a0 It\u2019s\u00a0important to only use a\u00a0cleaner\u00a0that\u2019s\u00a0approved specifically for dogs\u00a0or cats. Avoid using ordinary household items like water, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, vinegar, essential oils, etc. These materials will not efficiently clean the ear canal and may lead to your dog developing ear infections or even damage to the ear canal. Approved ear cleaners can be\u00a0purchased\u00a0from your veterinarian, online, or from major pet retail stores.\u00a0\u00a0 Clean cotton\u00a0balls, or\u00a0cotton wipes are\u00a0recommended for ear\u00a0cleanings. Cotton swabs should never be used because they can push wax down into the ear canal, making it harder to dislodge the build-up. In certain situations, cotton swabs could also potentially cause damage to the eardrum.\u00a0 \ufffcDog Ear Cleaning: A Step-By-Step Guide:\u00a0 Get ready. Make sure you have all your supplies within arm\u2019s reach: an approved cleaner, cotton balls\u00a0or wipes.\u00a0 Have support. If your dog is not used to ear cleanings, you may need another person to help hold them while you clean their ears. Restraining your dog can be done by gently placing an arm around their neck to prevent it from pulling away. Use the other hand to gently stabilize the head or the back half of their body if they are trying to pull away. Remember not to squeeze too tightly.\u00a0 Expect a mess. Until you know how much your dog will fight or wiggle, clean your dog\u2019s ears outside or in a place that\u2019s easy to clean, if possible.\u00a0A towel may be helpful to keep the rest of their body clean.\u00a0 Be gentle. Carefully hold the exterior floppy or erect portion of the dog\u2019s ear that is made up of hair, skin, cartilage, and blood vessels (called the pinnae) to allow for exposure to the ear canal.\u00a0 Use a cleaner. Fill the ear canal with an\u00a0\ufffcapproved ear cleaner, making sure it fills both the horizontal and vertical ear canal. Gently massage the base of your dog\u2019s ear while slowly moving your hand upward so the entire ear canal is massaged.\u00a0 Shake it out. Allow your dog to shake their head. Even though it\u2019s messy, shaking lets your dog expel most of the cleaner and wax on their own, making your job easier.\u00a0 Wipe up. Use a clean cotton ball to wipe out as much of the ear canal as you can see. Do not shove the cotton ball into the ear to avoid injury or the cotton ball getting stuck. Repeat the wiping process using clean cotton balls until the cotton ball is clean and there is no more visible discharge in the ear canal.\u00a0 Featured image: iStock.com/M_a_y_a"}]
