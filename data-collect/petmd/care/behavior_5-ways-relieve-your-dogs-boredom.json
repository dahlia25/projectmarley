Follow these tips to relieve and prevent your dog\u2019s boredom.", "articleBody": "By Maura McAndrew When we think of dogs, life\u2019s simple pleasures come to mind: a nice long nap, a good bowl of food, a casual stroll around the neighborhood. And while it\u2019s true that dogs enjoy having a daily routine, they can still get restless and bored. Just like humans, dogs need mental and physical stimulation to lead fulfilling lives. \u201cBoredom is not the trivial annoyance it is sometimes dismissed as. Animal boredom is biologically plausible: animals avoid monotony and seek stimulation,\u201d stated University of London biologist Charlotte C. Burn, in an August 2017 paper published in the journal Animal Behaviour. Recognizing Boredom in Dogs So how can you tell if your dog is experiencing boredom? \u201cMost often, boredom is going to result in negative behaviors, whether it be chewing, destroying, clawing, whining, or barking,\u201d explains Dr. Abby Coodin, veterinarian with Painted Sky Veterinary Services in Amery, Wisconsin. And there\u2019s not just one particular type of dog that gets restless, either. While younger dogs and working breeds may need the most stimulation, \u201cany breed or dog can become bored,\u201d says Tiffany Talley, a certified canine behavior counselor and specialist with All Things Canine in Tulsa, Oklahoma. If your dog is bored, Talley says, \u201cYou can come home to multiple holes dug in your yard, destruction in the home\u2026you may also come home to a very stimulated dog just when your day is winding down.\u201d This can be a challenge, she says, but \u201cwe have to remember that when we come home from work at the end of our day, our dog&#039;s day is just beginning. That&#039;s when the awesome family interaction and affection starts.\u201d We all want to give our dogs the best possible lives, and this includes mental stimulation, entertainment, and fun. With this in mind, we asked our experts to share some of the best ways to relieve\u2014and prevent\u2014feelings of boredom in our furry friends. 1. Get Some Exercise (and Mix It Up) Your dog doesn\u2019t care how tired you are\u2014he needs to get out and about for exercise daily. According to Coodin, boredom and obesity often go hand in hand for dogs. \u201cCertainly boredom can lead to obesity because they\u2019re not moving around as much,\u201d she explains, \u201cand owners often don\u2019t recognize obesity as frequently as we\u2019d like them to.\u201d And with some dogs, just walking every day is not enough to stave off boredom or weight gain. Talley suggests \u201ctaking the dog to a new environment\u201d (in fact, even riding in the car to a new place can be mentally stimulating for a dog) or \u201cdoing a new activity, game, or a new behavior.\u201d Coodin recommends running or biking, if you and your dog are able, as this promotes added mental stimulation in addition to fitness. \u201cIt releases more energy than an actual walk,\u201d she says. \u201cTheir mind has to be focused, because they\u2019re doing the job. Walking around, they can kind of look here, look there, smell this, smell that. But running with you or biking with you, they have to pay attention.\u201d 2. Socialize \u201cSocialization is one of the most important aspects of training,\u201d Coodin explains, and it\u2019s also key to keeping boredom at bay. \u201cIt can help them interact a lot more with their general outside world and be more entertained,\u201d she says. Socialization is twofold: your dog should be able to interact easily with humans as well as other dogs. If they\u2019re socialized, they\u2019re less likely to be isolated and bored. This process works best during puppyhood, Coodin explains: \u201cThose first eight to 10 weeks are extremely important for them to be exposed to all different aspects of the environment\u2014the people, the pets, and all of that\u2014to be sure that they see things, so when they\u2019re an adult, they\u2019re not scared of them.\u201d Other perks of a social dog? Physical exercise and mental stimulation are that much easier to achieve. \u201cHaving play dates with other dogs is great exercise,\u201d Talley says. \u201cPairing dogs with comparable temperaments and play styles is beneficial for not only your dog but the play dog also.\u201d Play dates are lower stress, but dog parks or doggie day care are also good options for more boisterous mutts. 3. Use Food Puzzles Alleviating dog boredom can be as simple as changing your feeding routine\u2014make it a task instead of a given. \u201cHumans can avoid feeding dogs out of a bowl, which is quick and routine,\u201d Talley says. \u201cThey can use puzzles to give dry diet\u2026hide diet under bowls and around the kitchen, or hide treats in the yard to have the dog use their nose, brain, and body to get the rewards.\u201d Coodin notes that \u201cthey make tons of puzzle toys these days for dogs.\u201d Talley recommends interactive bowls and stick and ball puzzles, among others. Dogs identify which compartment the food is in and then figure out how to open it, Coodin explains. She adds that this doesn\u2019t work with all dogs, as some figure it out quickly and lose interest. But a puzzle can be just the right thing, depending on your dog\u2019s needs and level of craftiness. 4. Put Your Dog to \u201cWork\u201d Many dogs\u2014particularly herding and hunting breeds\u2014long to be put to work. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean training as a K-9 police officer or pulling a dog sled; it can be any kind of task or game that involves work. When boredom strikes, explains Coodin, it\u2019s often \u201ca high-energy dog that an owner has put into a low-energy family or situation.\u201d If these dogs are \u201cnot walked regularly or given any sort of a job\u2026they become inherently sort of excited but have nowhere to release that excess energy,\u201d she says. Jobs can include nosework, which Coodin explains \u201ccan just be dogs identifying certain things in the home\u201d (i.e., hiding treats and encouraging your dog to find them). Teaching new behaviors and tricks can also feel work-like to a dog, and even exercise can include an element of work. \u201cIf they become a running partner or an agility partner, where they have something they\u2019re going out and training to do,\u201d that can scratch that itch for a \u201cjob\u201d as well, Coodin says. \u00a0 5. Enroll in Classes If you have the means, enrolling your dog in a class with a local trainer can be a wonderfully stimulating way to relieve boredom. If your dog enjoys nosework, for example, a class can take it to the next level. \u201cWe have certain dogs that are actually in training or classes for scent identification,\u201d Coodin says, \u201cwhether it be dogs that are cadaver trained or just trained as scent dogs with herbs or something like that.\u201d Other options for classes include obedience and agility training. \u201cAgility or jumps classes can be great to help,\u201d Talley notes. Jumps classes are just what they sound like\u2014kind of like mini-equestrian courses for dogs\u2014and agility classes combine jumps with weave poles, tunnels, and other obstacles. These courses typically require a certain level of obedience training prior to enrollment. \u201cThese are not play session classes with other dogs,\u201d Talley clarifies. \u201cThey focus only on the activities. In these classes, the dogs are all off-lead but have \u2018jobs\u2019 or \u2018exercises\u2019 to do in the presence of other dogs and humans.\u201d\u00a0 Managing Your Dog\u2019s Boredom If enrolling your dog in a class, make sure you find a legitimate training facility that uses positive reinforcement. Trainers, behaviorists, and veterinarians can also be a good first step for advice when dealing with a bored dog who is acting out. According to Coodin, \u201cThe best thing is to talk with a dog trainer or someone who is knowledgeable in animal behavior training to see, number one, if there is some medical reason why the dog is not interacting appropriately, or they can help come up with some ideas\u201d to manage the issue. The key is not to give up: you will find the appropriate level of stimulation that will improve your dog\u2019s life\u2014and yours as well. With the right approach, Coodin says, \u201cnine times out of 10, we can \u2018cure\u2019 a problem with a dog that has these behaviors.\u201d"}]
