So, what can you do now that you are doing all of the work? Don\u2019t worry. Our experts have answers. The Behavioral Chart One approach \u2014 especially for younger children \u2014 is to create a behavioral chart. \u201cChildren do the best with limits and consequences but not if you become emotional,\u201d notes therapist and author Judith Belmont. \u201cA chart can be a successful tool.\u201d Basically, you give your child very specific responsibilities. \u201cSpell out what you want them to do, for example, walk the dog after dinner Monday, Wednesday and Friday; feed the dog in the morning on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Check off when they\u2019ve done each task. When a certain number of boxes are checked, they have earned something. For example, five checks and you take them to a movie.\u201d Coming Up Against Resistance Okay, so what if they still won\u2019t do what is expected of them? \u201cThere needs to be a consequence,\u201d says Janette Sasson Edgette, Psy.D, an author and licensed clinical psychologist who specializes in family counseling. A dawdling child who consistently misses the school bus might be required to pay back her mom for having to drive her to school. For slacking on pet responsibilities, \u201cpay back time can include helping with paperwork at the parent\u2019s office, or donating time to the parent\u2019s favorite charity,\u201d suggests Sasson Edgette. \u201cIf they are older, have them run errands such as taking the pet to the vet or going to the grocery store. I call these types of repercussions \u2018consequences of inconvenience.\u2019\u201d These repercussions don\u2019t need to be harsh and they shouldn\u2019t be done to punish. \u201cIt\u2019s as if you\u2019re saying, \u2018Well, that was an unfortunate decision. As you know, here\u2019s what happens now.\u2019 It works to motivate because the next time she\u2019s about to be casual about time in the morning, she remembers having to work over the weekend.\u201d Don\u2019t Pick Up the Slack \u201cIf at any time the chores are neglected,\u201d adds psychotherapist Tina B. Tessina, Ph.D., \u201cthe penalties should be the same as for not doing homework or neglecting other household chores. Be firm. Until they have completed the tasks do not allow the child certain luxuries, like the use of electronic devices, their smart phone or watching TV. If you pick up the slack you\u2019re teaching your child to be irresponsible.\u201d Positive and Negative Consequences \u201cChildren can adhere to a behavior to avoid a negative consequence,\u201d says Belmont. \u201cAvoiding a negative consequence is knowing ahead what to expect. If it is raining and you bring your umbrella, you can open your umbrella and stay dry; if you don\u2019t bring your umbrella, you will get wet. That is a negative consequence directly related to your behavior. You want to teach a child responsibility. You give them a choice. They can avoid a consequence by doing a positive behavior.\u201d What about Teens? \u201cTeenagers always want something and they want it very badly,\u201d notes social worker Tara Kemp. \u201cIt may be they want to go to a party, or to the mall for new clothes. So, it is up to you to say, \u2018Yes, you can do those things, as soon as you walk the dog.\u2019 It is an unavoidable part of parenting to set limits for your kids. That is your job.\u201d"}]
