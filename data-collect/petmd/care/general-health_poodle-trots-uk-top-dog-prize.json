Ricky, from Preston in north west England, will now retire from UK competitions, his owner revealed. &quot;I couldn&#039;t have asked for anything more,&quot; Jason Lynn said after his triumph at Birmingham&#039;s National Exhibition Centre. &quot;He gave an absolutely beautiful performance and I am so proud of him. &quot;He was top dog all breeds last year and we decided that this would be his last show -- and he has ended it in the most wonderful way possible.&quot; &quot;The poodle fought off competition from a Pomeranian, a wire fox terrier, an Irish Wolfhound, a Samoyed, a Rottweiler and an American Cocker Spaniel in the final round of competition. The show celebrates its 123rd anniversary this year. Image via Crufts"}]
