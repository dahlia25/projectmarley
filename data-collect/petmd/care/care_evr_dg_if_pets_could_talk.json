Dunn, Jr., DVM  Do pets grieve the passing of their human friends? The answer is easy if you understand the message of this story. If pets could talk, this is what they would say \u2026 I\u2019m waiting for you! Where did you go? Since that day when the whole family was upset and crying, and you weren&#039;t there for our evening walk, I\u2019ve had an empty feeling inside me and all I want to do is find you. Now all I have are memories because you just aren&#039;t where you always used to be. I remember how you and I would be the first ones up in the morning \u2026 we would take our walk before all the other people and cars would wake up. You and me, the soft morning sunlight and a chorus of birds happily announcing the arrival of another new day \u2026 that\u2019s how every day would start. Now I walk alone when the family lets me out. Sometimes we\u2019d go one way, up the hill to the old cemetery under the broad, outstretched arms of the big White Pine trees. Some days you\u2019d pick the other way and down the road we\u2019d hike to Eddy Creek where I could swim and look for frogs. I never knew which way you were going to choose, you always made me guess and sometimes I\u2019d guess wrong and you\u2019d say, &quot;No. We\u2019re going this way today.&quot; Those walks we took were our private times together. I got really excited before our walks because you always let me beI&#039;ll wait here for you. myself. You let me run and follow the scent trails of other animals. You let me dig up things that smelled good. You let me carry sticks in my mouth just because it felt good. I think you knew how proud I was whenever I could prance about with a useless old stick in my mouth. Sometimes I\u2019d drop it at your feet and you\u2019d pretend you didn\u2019t know what to do with it. You\u2019d tease me and ask, &quot;What\u2019s this for?\u00a0 What do you want me to do with this ole stick?&quot; I\u2019d dance around and bark and crouch really low and you\u2019d say, &quot;Oh, I see&quot; and you\u2019d send it flying through the air for me to fetch. You knew I especially liked it when you\u2019d throw a stick into Eddy Creek and I\u2019d have to do some fancy swimming to retrieve it before it was carried off around the bend. I liked Eddy Creek, even when you\u2019d tell me to lie down under the big willow tree for long naps while you worked your newest homemade trout fly across the water\u2019s surface. I liked those naps and you liked those smelly little trout we\u2019d take home for supper. I liked waiting for you back then because I always knew we\u2019d play again tomorrow. Where did you go? I\u2019m waiting for you! Ever since that awful night so long ago when you didn\u2019t take me for our evening walk through the yard, everything has been so different and strange. Where did you go? The family lets me out the door now, early like when you and I use to have our walks, but now all I do is walk by myself up to the old cemetery.\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019ve given up visiting Eddy Creek in the morning. It\u2019s too quiet there and I don\u2019t see the little trout anymore. For a long time after you were gone I used to think I could still see you there at the water&#039;s edge with your teeth showing, your brown straw hat shading your eyes and your fly line looping over the water. I\u2019d be so happy to see you I\u2019d jump up and run to you\u2026 but you\u2019d be gone when I\u2019d get to the creek. I think the birds have left too because I don\u2019t hear their happy songs celebrating the misty mornings like they used to when we were together. \u00a0 The only place I feel like I\u2019m close to you, where I think I can still feel your hand on my head like I did when I sat next to your reading chair, is when I sit near the stone with your name on it. That\u2019s the only place I feel close to you now, where it feels like you are close to me. But that\u2019s okay because I have lots to think about while I\u2019m waiting for you. Sometimes I think back to my first day with our family. I was happy and afraid at the same time and very curious about my new surroundings that were to be my home. Everyone was busy rubbing my ears and patting my head, picking me up and clapping their hands to get my attention.\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, I found you, quietly sitting in your chair reading. It looked safe there by your side, so I sat there, too. I felt your gentle hand rub my cheek and all you said was a soft &quot;Good boy&quot;. Then you said to the rest of the family, &quot;I think he just needs to rest now&quot;.\u00a0 From then on I always felt safe next to you.\u00a0 You are my true friend. Maybe that\u2019s why I spend every day here \u2026 waiting for you. I know you\u2019re here. I just don\u2019t know why we can\u2019t play anymore. Where did you go? Sometimes I hear myself whine and sigh because I miss you so much \u2026 I wonder if you hear me. I can\u2019t see you or hear you or smell you, but you must be near because this is the only place I feel safe. So I\u2019ll keep coming here to be with you, I\u2019ll sit by the rock with your name on it and remember all the fun we had together. Deep inside me I know we will have more walks to take again someday. We\u2019ll turn left at the road and hike down the hill to Eddy Creek. You\u2019ll patiently tie on your newest trout fly and I\u2019ll be lying under the willow tree watching you. Until then, I promise you, with all the loyalty in my heart, I\u2019ll stay right here so you can find me. I&#039;ll be next to the rock with your name on it, waiting for you. *** \u00a0 Are you struggling with thoughts of having to put a beloved pet to sleep?
