Consider these eight risks before treating your pet at home.", "articleBody": "By Paula Fitzsimmons With an abundance of pet care advice flowing freely online, it\u2019s tempting to enter a few search terms, read the first article that seems legit, then proceed to treat your pet. Convenient, yes. But in doing so, you could be putting your beloved pet\u2019s health in jeopardy. \u201cThe internet is a powerful tool, and when you find appropriate websites, it can be the source of very good information,\u201d says Dr. Anne Stoneham, a veterinarian with University Veterinary Specialists in McMurray, Pennsylvania. \u201cHowever, there is also a wealth of misinformation on Google\u2014or Dr. Google, as many of us in the vet biz call it\u2014and from your non-veterinarian friend.\u201d If you\u2019d like to treat a minor ailment at home, do so only after consulting with your vet. In contrast to the few minutes you spent reading that article, your vet has gone through undergraduate education, four years of rigorous vet school training, and perhaps an internship and residency as well. \u201cYou should trust that they do have a great deal of knowledge and have your pet\u2019s best interest at heart,\u201d says Stoneham, who is board-certified in veterinary emergency and critical care. \u201cIf you do not trust your veterinarian for whatever reason, get a second opinion from another veterinarian, not from Aunt Sylvie, who raised Otterhounds for 15 years or had a cat once.\u201d Consider these eight risks before treating your pet at home. 1. Giving Over-the-Counter Drugs Not Intended for Companion Animals Some human medications work for pets, but unless you\u2019ve talked to your vet first, you\u2019re inviting trouble. \u201cA person and a dog have different physiologies, a person and a cat have different physiologies, and all that needs to be taken into account,\u201d says Dr. John Gicking, a veterinarian with BluePearl Veterinary Specialists in Tampa, Florida. Sometimes the same medicine can benefit both pets and people, he says, \u201cbut there are a lot of differences.\u201d That\u2019s why a vet should always be consulted. Take over-the-counter pain relievers, for example. Pet parents might be tempted to reach for their own old standbys like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, but Stoneham says that in dogs \u201ctheir use is rarely recommended because side effects (kidney failure, liver failure, stomach ulcers) are seen so frequently.\u201d And Stoneham warns, \u201cBoth of these medications are very toxic for cats\u2014even low doses are life-threatening.\u201d Other over-the-counter medications can be just as dangerous. Gicking, who is board-certified in veterinary emergency and critical care, has treated dogs with severe gastrointestinal problems, including perforations in the stomach, and kidney failure, after their owners gave them naproxen (Aleve). Aspirin falls in the same category. \u201cWe see so many owners who give pets aspirin. It can cause gastric or intestinal ulceration. Just don&#039;t do it,\u201d says Dr. Susan Jeffrey, a veterinarian with Truesdell Animal Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin. \u201cInstead, talk to your vet about pain control designed for pets.\u201d Even if a drug is deemed safe for animals, you also need to consider additives, which Jeffrey says can be toxic to animals. \u201cAn example of this is the additive xylitol. It&#039;s used as a sweetener, but can cause low blood sugar levels and liver toxicity in dogs.\u201d 2. Giving the Wrong Dosage of Over-the-Counter Drugs Even a product considered safe for animals can do damage if it\u2019s misdosed. Dosage requirements vary greatly (by species and even between individuals of the same species), says Dr. Nicholle Jenkins, an emergency veterinarian with University Veterinary Specialists. \u201cMost humans, with the exception of children, are dosed the same. This is not the case with pets,\u201d she explains. \u201cFor example, a 3-pound Chihuahua will not use the same dose as a 100-pound Great Dane. When these medications are incorrectly dosed, they are either useless or harmful.\u201d Take Benadryl, for instance. \u201cThe dosing is different for pets than it is for people,\u201d says Jeffrey, whose professional interests include preventative care. \u201cAlthough it&#039;s fairly safe, it can cause sedation. If it is given with other medications that have sedative effects, then it may make a pet too sleepy, which could be dangerous.\u201d 3. Giving a Product that Interferes with Prescription Drugs Over-the-counter products can also adversely interact with vet-prescribed medications, says Jenkins, who specializes in emergency veterinary medicine. Aspirin is one of these. \u201cIf an owner starts using this before bringing their pet in to see the veterinarian, it limits which medications can be used.\u201d When given in combination with a prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory, aspirin increases the risk of stomach and intestinal ulceration, she says. For these reasons, she stresses the importance of telling your vet about any over-the-counter drugs and supplements your pets are taking. 4. Treating the Wrong Ailment That article or friend you consulted may mention symptoms that seem similar to your pet\u2019s, but only vets are trained to detect subtle differences.\u00a0 \u201cFor example, there have been many instances of pet owners administering medications for musculoskeletal pain when in reality their pets are suffering from gastrointestinal pain,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cThose medications may make the original problem worse. This may also delay a pet from getting proper treatment and being on the road to recovery.\u201d Although it\u2019s a secondary consideration, treating the wrong ailment can lead to financial losses. \u201cSicker pets are probably going to require hospitalization instead of care at home,\u201d Stoneham says. \u201cThey will likely need a longer time in the hospital than they would if they were not so sick, and all of this generally means a higher cost of care.\u201d 5. Giving Medications Prescribed for Other Pets Giving a pet a drug prescribed for another pet\u2014even for the same breed\u2014can result in several complications, Stoneham says. \u201cFor example, metoclopramide may be prescribed for a pet that is vomiting once the doctor has ruled out the possibility of an intestinal blockage,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if you use metoclopramide on your pet at home who does have an intestinal blockage, it could lead to intestinal rupture (and a much, much sicker patient).\u201d It\u2019s also a bad idea to give products intended for one species to another. \u201cSome over-the-counter flea medications that are safe for dogs are highly toxic to cats and that mistake is easy to make,\u201d Gicking explains. \u201cPeople will buy a big dog\u2019s dose and they\u2019ll split it among multiple cats, causing a big problem.\u201d 6. Using Natural Products Incorrectly Natural does not necessarily mean safe. Herbal remedies, homeopathy, essential oils, and other natural products are being used more frequently in veterinary medicine, says Stoneham. She says most medications have been derived from something natural\u2014like atropine from the belladonna plant and digoxin from the foxglove plant\u2014but have been processed to a more pure product. Stoneham recalls how, about 15 years ago, dogs started presenting with severely high blood pressure and tremors. It turns out they had gotten into their owner\u2019s bottle of herbal weight loss pills. \u201cIt contained ephedrine, a stimulant that is very toxic for dogs,\u201d she says.\u00a0 Another consideration is that these products are often not regulated, and may not contain the ingredients specified on the label, Jeffrey says. \u201cAlso, many of the homeopathic medications haven&#039;t been evaluated in conjunction with other medications, so the side effects of the medications combined are unknown. Just because it might be good for a human, doesn&#039;t mean it is good for a pet.\u201d 7. Accidentally Ingesting Natural Oils While essential oils are often used to treat skin irritations or as a flea and tick repellant, animals can accidentally ingest these oils, says Stoneham. \u201cBecause dogs and cats groom themselves and each other, any animal in the home is at risk, not just the ones who are treated,\u201d she says. \u201cSome essential oils can be absorbed through the skin.\u201d For example, oil of wintergreen is not only absorbed through the skin but is metabolized to aspirin, which can be toxic to both cats and dogs, Stoneham warns. Improper dilutions of essential oils can be toxic for pets, which is why it\u2019s important to consult with a veterinarian first. According to Stoneham, dogs treated with pennyroyal oil have ended up in liver failure, and animals treated with tea tree oil and citrus oil can develop neurologic problems that can manifest as depression, unsteadiness, tremors, and coma. 8. Waiting Too Long to See a Vet If your cat or dog is sick, waiting to see a vet is a bad idea. \u201cIf, for example, a pet has an intestinal foreign body and it is stuck, it could result in perforation of the intestine,\u201d Jeffrey says. \u201cThis requires emergency surgery and can even kill a pet.\u201d If you think your pet has swallowed something other than food, it is very important to call the veterinarian, she says. You should also call your vet if your pet won\u2019t eat. \u201cCats who don&#039;t eat for a few days can develop a life-threatening condition called hepatic lipidosis (fatty liver),\u201d Jeffrey says. \u201cTaking the cat to the vet at the onset of a poor appetite can save a kitty&#039;s life.\u201d Another example is vomiting in cats. \u201cMany owners think vomiting is a normal occurrence for a cat when it is not,\u201d Jeffrey says. \u201cCats should not vomit more than once every few months.\u201d Cats who vomit more frequently than this may have conditions such as chronic renal disease, inflammatory bowel disease, hyperthyroidism, or even lymphoma. \u201cIn addition, kitties who have lost a lot of weight over a period of time are not \u2018just getting old.\u2019 Many of these kitties can have the same diseases as noted above.\u201d When in doubt about your pet\u2019s health, call your veterinarian, advises Jenkins. \u201cMost veterinary clinics would prefer for a pet owner to call and ask questions instead of administering a medication or supplement without direction.\u201d"}]
