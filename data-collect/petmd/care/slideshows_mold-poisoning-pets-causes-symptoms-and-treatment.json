Learn more here.", "articleBody": "By David F. Kramer \u00a0 For far longer than there have been pets and their people, there has been mold. Mold is neither a plant nor an animal but a member of the fungus family. Molds help in the\u00a0biodegradation\u00a0of organic matter, which is a crucial function for our ecosystem. But some molds can lead to serious consequences for our pets, as well as for us. The problem with mold is that it can be found almost anywhere\u2014both inside our homes and outside\u2014provided there\u2019s sufficient warmth and moisture to support it. \u00a0 According to Dr. Patrick Mahaney\u00a0of Los Angeles,\u00a0mold can be found in drywall, around windows and floors, and even in clothing and towels that we\u2019re about to wash\u2014and sometimes even after they\u2019re washed. Mold can easily be inhaled or licked off of a tainted surface. That smelly towel your dog is always chewing on might be more than just smelly. \u00a0 Dr. Jennifer Coates, veterinary advisor with petMD adds, \u201cToxic mold is of particular concern for pets because these organisms produce mycotoxins that can cause health problems.\u201d \u00a0 There are five categories of toxic mold:\u00a0Cladosporium, Penicilium, Fusarium, Aspergillus, and\u00a0Stachybotrys. These molds can cause anything from a sneezing or coughing fit to, in extreme cases, neurologic problems and death. \u00a0 Mold can be found pretty much anywhere pets like to spend time, whether in your dog\u2019s prime snoozing or play area, or on your cat\u2019s\u00a0favorite sunning spot\u00a0on the windowsill. Once you let your pet outside, mold can be found in decaying food, rotten tree stumps, and in the soil itself. So even in the relative safety of your own backyard, pets aren\u2019t necessarily safe from mold. According to Coates, problems with mold in pets fall into three categories: inhalation, ingestion, and allergic reactions: \u00a0 Inhaling mold can cause respiratory distress (breathing that takes more effort or occurs more rapidly than normal), nasal discharge, coughing, wheezing, sneezing, lethargy, and sometimes bleeding from the mouth and/or nose.According to Dr. Mahaney, the ingestion of mold can lead to gastric symptoms such as decreased appetite, vomiting, and stool changes.Signs of an allergy to mold might include excessive scratching, chewing, or licking, which sometimes progresses to the point of fur loss and the development of sores.\u00a0 In all cases, getting to the vet is crucial. According to Mahaney, veterinary treatment for mold inhalation or ingestion is generally focused on supportive care, including the management of respiratory symptoms, vomiting, and the administering of IV fluids for dehydration from gastric distress. Mold allergies can be treated with medications that lessen the immune system\u2019s response.\u00a0 \u00a0 The prognosis for a pet afflicted by mold is generally good, and provided the source of the mold is properly removed to prevent continued problems, your pet should fully recover. As is the case with any sort of health problem, getting your animal to the vet as soon as possible is key. According to Coates, this last point is especially true if you are dealing with one of the mycotoxin-producing molds that can cause serious health problems in pets. If you suspect mold growth in your home, there are several ways to confirm it. While professionals are available who specialize in discovering and treating household mold, there are also some do-it-yourself methods, including test kits that can be purchased in stores and online. If you discover mold yourself, you can tackle it with a mix of water and bleach, but if the affected area is large, it\u2019s best to call in a professional. It\u2019s best to keep your pet away from any areas in your home that are contaminated with mold. If a case is particularly bad, it might be a good idea to relocate your pet to a friend or relative\u2019s house while yours is being professionally treated. \u00a0 Store pet food in an air-tight container to discourage mold growth. Water bowls, food bowls, and plastic or rubber chew toys should be thoroughly cleaned at least once a week. Launder and completely dry pet beds, plush toys, and other similar items your pet may use frequently to lessen the chances of mold growth. A best practice is to keep anything your pet touches clean and dry. \u00a0 It\u2019s also important to keep your pet from eating out of the trash or from having access to spoiled food or drink. People often leave containers and leftover food on the ground, so when you and your pet are out for walks, always be aware of anything they might get into. \u00a0 \u201cProtect your pet from dietary indiscretions; no eating things they shouldn\u2019t, both inside and outside of the home,\u201d says Mahaney. \u201cThat means not letting your pets have free rein outside by walking them on a leash. Inside, we need to make sure that our baseboards, drywall, and windows are not growing mold that the pets could potentially be exposed to, and keeping down the humidity in our homes to prevent the growth of mold.\u201d Mushroom, Mold, Yeast Poisoning in Dogs \u00a0 Mushroom, Mold, Yeast Poisoning in Cats \u00a0 Geography Matters with Blastomycosis \u00a0 Water Mold Infection (Pythiosis) in Dogs \u00a0 Water Mold Infection (Pythiosis) in Cats \u00a0 4 Pet Food Storage Tips to Keep Your Dog Safe \u00a0 4 Pet Food Storage Tips to Keep Your Cat Safe \u00a0 What You Don&#039;t Know About Mushrooms Can Kill Your Dog \u00a0 6 Poisonous Mushrooms That Are Toxic to Dogs \u00a0 Mushroom Poisoning in Dogs"}]
