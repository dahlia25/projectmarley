And what are some tips for making the new name stick?", "articleBody": "By Helen Anne Travis Every year, the Michelson Found Animals Foundation helps thousands of animals in the Los Angeles area find their forever homes. The majority of pets are strays, which means shelter staff and volunteers have to come up with new names for thousands of cats and dogs each year. Sounds like fun, doesn\u2019t it? \u201cIt is for the first few hundred,\u201d says Aimee Gilbreath, executive director of the rescue organization. \u201cBut then it gets a little challenging.\u201d To make the process as easy and fun as possible, the volunteers and staff use shortcuts. They might name a litter of puppies after the characters on Game of Thrones or Star Wars. Sometimes they\u2019ll take their inspiration from the season (there are a lot of white kittens named Snowflake each winter). If the animals have distinct personalities or physical features, those traits might influence their names. The foundation once worked with a local shelter that was trying to find a home for an older pup with only three legs, Gilbreath says. They named her Eileen (get it?). But what if you had a horrible boss named Eileen and don\u2019t want to be reminded of her every time you see your new dog? That is a conundrum faced by almost all prospective pet owners who visit shelters nationwide. Is it OK to rename an adopted pet? And what are some tips for making the new name stick? Why Shelters Name Pets Naming shelter animals helps potential adopters form a bond, says Gilbreath. It\u2019s a lot easier to fall in love with \u201cSnowflake\u201d than \u201cCat Number 3,298.\u201d \u201cThere are so many animals looking for homes,\u201d says Jme Thomas, executive director of the Motley Zoo Animal Rescue in Redmond, Washington. \u201cAnything you can do to better market an animal to an adopter is essential to saving their lives.\u201d At Motley Zoo, most animals are named after musicians or celebrities. Right now Celine Dion, Mario Batali and John Mayer are all looking for forever homes. To further appeal to potential adopters, the animals are sometimes photographed with their celebrity namesakes, like Gin and Juice, two cats who got to meet Snoop Dogg. \u201cIt gives the animal an identity,\u201d says Thomas. But what if the animal comes to the shelter already named? Say a dog\u2019s owner died or a cat had to be surrendered because a landlord didn\u2019t allow pets? For the most part, the name stays, says Thomas. Gilbreath agreed that\u2019s standard practice. \u201cAt most shelters, if an animal has a name you keep the name unless there\u2019s a good reason not to,\u201d she says. Good reasons to change a pet\u2019s name include instances of past abuse. Shelters will also rename pets whose current name might prevent them from finding a forever home. Gilbreath remembers working with a rescuer who was trying to find a home for a dog named Killer after his owner passed away. The dog was renamed Keller, something that sounded like his original name but was perhaps more appealing to potential adopters. Can You Rename Your Pet After Adoption? Even if a pet has had a name for years, if you don\u2019t like \u201cKeller\u201d, \u201cGin,\u201d or \u201cJuice\u201d, the Motley Zoo staff and volunteers tell adopters it\u2019s okay to come up with a new name for your new pet. \u201cI feel like 99 percent of the time it\u2019s completely okay to rename your pet,\u201d says Thomas. \u201cIt\u2019s a fresh start for you and them, and it can be a bonding experience.\u201d Gilbreath agrees, especially when it comes to kittens and puppies who have only had their shelter name for a few days or weeks. But when it comes to renaming an adult cat or dog who may have had a name for almost a decade, she warns there might be some confusion during the transition. But that shouldn\u2019t hold you back, says Gilbreath\u2014especially if it\u2019s a name you dislike. \u201cIf the name is going to interfere with your relationship with the pet then by all means rename it,\u201d says Gilbreath. How to Teach Pets Their New Name It could take a few days or a few weeks for the pet to understand their new name, says Gilbreath. You may have to use their old name a few times during the transition, Thomas says, especially if your pet is unknowingly ignoring you because she thinks she\u2019s still Snowflake. But both agreed that if you consistently pair the new name with positive reinforcement like treats, pets and praise, the animals will start to understand and respond to the new name. Even cats, who get a reputation for being untrainable, will start to get the hint if you say their names when it\u2019s dinner time, says Gilbreath. \u201cPets are really good at reading us,\u201d she says. \u201cThey will quickly learn that the new name makes you happy and they will adapt to that.\u201d"}]
