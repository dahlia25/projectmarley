Find out once and for all whether it\u2019s safe to sleep with your pet.", "articleBody": "By Nancy Dunham Go ahead and sleep with your dog\u2014it\u2019s perfectly safe, as long as you are both healthy. In fact, sharing your bedroom with your canine companion\u2014as long as he isn&#039;t under the covers\u2014may actually improve your sleep, according to recent research published by Mayo Clinic Proceedings. Although researchers didn\u2019t study the impact of felines sleeping with their pet parents, anecdotally, veterinarians suggest the results are mostly positive (though the nocturnal cat may be a bit more disruptive). \u201cToday, many pet owners are away from their pets for much of the day, so they want to maximize their time with them when they are home,\u201d stated Lois Krahn, M.D., study coauthor and a sleep medicine specialist at the Center for Sleep Medicine on Mayo Clinic\u2019s Arizona campus in a press release. \u201cHaving them in the bedroom at night is an easy way to do that. And, now, pet owners can find comfort knowing it won\u2019t negatively impact their sleep.\u201d The report left many pet owners puzzled, though. Pet experts have long advised pet parents not to sleep with their dogs or cats for at least two main reasons: it will promote poor behavior in the animal and could lead to serious illness in humans. Many vets now believe concerns over such issues are overstated or just incorrect. The resultant behavior can negatively impact both pet parents and their four-legged friends, says Dr. Ann Hohenhaus, a staff doctor at the Animal Medical Center in New York City, who specializes in small animal internal medicine and\u00a0oncology.\u00a0\u201cSleeping with your pet is an important ritual for many people,\u201d she says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need to be avoided if both pet and owner are healthy.\u201d Behavior Issues Related to Pets Sleeping on Beds Despite what you\u2019ve heard, allowing a dog or cat on the bed doesn\u2019t cause behavioral problems. There are aggressive animals that you may not want to allow on a bed. Their aggression is often rooted in fear and is not caused by allowing them on beds or furniture, says certified dog behavior consultant and professional trainer Russell Hartstein. \u201cThere is chronic confusion over this issue. It is completely fine to have them on the bed,\u201d says Hartstein, CEO of FunPawCare, based in Los Angeles and Miami. \u201cIt\u2019s actually funny this question even exists. These dominance theories were debunked (long ago). One reason people believe some of this is that some animal TV show hosts don\u2019t follow evidence-based science.\u201d The bigger issue, Hartstein says, is the pet owner\u2019s lifestyle. Do they mind pet hair on furniture? Are they comfortable sleeping with a pet by their feet? Will a cat\u2019s decision to leave in the middle of night disrupt the person\u2019s sleep? If owners don\u2019t mind these inconveniences, the pet will enjoy the bed as much as the owner. \u201cPets love their parents and are drawn to their scents,\u201d he says. \u201cThey also prefer sleeping on elevated spaces.\u201d If sleeping on the bed isn\u2019t comfortable for the pet parent, Hartstein suggests installing a comfortable, clean pet bed in or near the bedroom. Put a piece of your clothing\u2014such as a T-shirt\u2014in the bed so the pet can enjoy your scent. Can Children Share a Bed with Pets? Like adult pet parents, young children often want to sleep with the family dog or cat. All cases differ, of course, but it\u2019s generally unwise to have a child of 6 or younger sleep alone with a pet. \u201cBefore a child should sleep alone with a pet, it\u2019s my opinion they should show that they can handle the responsibility,\u201d says Dr. Carol Osborne, a veterinarian who practices at Chagrin Falls Veterinary Center &amp; Pet Clinic in Ohio. \u201cA parent should monitor a child to make sure they use good judgment when they feed, water, or walk it. That\u2019s very important.\u201d Pulling a pet\u2019s tail, rough play, or neglecting his needs are all indications that the child is not yet mature enough to sleep with a pet. Dogs and cats may tolerate some childhood mischief but become fearful and will eventually strike out. Wait until the child has a record of maturity with the pet before allowing them to sleep together. One point you needn\u2019t worry about, though, is a cat smothering a sleeping infant. That\u2019s an old wives\u2019 tale, says Osborne and others. A tale of such an incident was told more than 300 years ago and has not faded from the public consciousness. \u201cMost cats are not interested in babies,\u201d she says. \u201cThey make random motions and they smell bad.\u201d It\u2019s still a good idea to keep pets away from babies, though. Babies, especially those younger than 3 months, are more susceptible to certain kinds of infections because of undeveloped immune systems. Health Concerns of Sleeping with a Pet Perhaps the greatest concern pet parents have about sleeping with a dog or cat is that they will catch a disease from him. It would be \u201cvery rare\u201d for something like that to occur if the pet and person are both in good health, our experts agree. Good health for a pet means no fleas, ticks, or other parasites, no illnesses, up-to-date vaccinations, and regular vet checkups. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason your vet wants to see your pet every year,\u201d Hohenhaus says. \u201cA vet wants to keep the pet healthy and identify risks so you don\u2019t get sick, too...But with the average, healthy pet, there is a very low risk they will spread an illness to a person.\u201d And for people, good health in these cases is basically defined as those who are not immunosuppressed. Cancer patients, transplant recipients, and H.I.V.-positive people are among those who should not sleep with pets. Although there was a recent report of a dog infecting a human with the plague, such transmission is extremely rare, our experts agree. The Centers for Disease Control reports that the majority of the approximately eight annual cases of plague in the United States occur in rural parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and California and are transmitted by rodents. \u201cKeep in mind that the CDC reports that contracting a disease from a family pet is \u2018rare,\u2019\u201dOsborne says. \u201cAnd sleeping with a pet has its benefits. A dog\u2019s body temperature is higher than ours, so particularly on a cold night, it\u2019s nice to snuggle with a dog. And dogs help us relax and allow some people with insomnia to sleep without [medications].\u201d"}]
