Fear not\u2014we\u2019ve got the full poop scoop right here. Why Dog Poop Can Be Dangerous As Dr. Chavez mentioned, there are some inherent dangers when it comes to handling dog poop, so it\u2019s important to always be vigilant and careful when doing so. \u201cDiseases that are transmitted from animals to humans are called zoonotic diseases,\u201d he said. \u201cZoonotic diseases that we can get from contaminated dog feces include Salmonella, Campylobacter, Giardia, roundworms and potentially hookworms.\u201d Complicating matters is the fact that sometimes our pets can be carrying these diseases \u2014 like Salmonella \u2014 without actually becoming ill themselves, so it\u2019s important to treat every one of your dog\u2019s bowel movements as carefully as possible. How to Properly Clean Dog Poop How you go about cleaning up your dog\u2019s poop will depend on where the accident actually occurs. In general though, the following are some expert-approved ways to scoop the poop that will keep you safe and help ensure that all fecal matter is properly disposed of. If dog poop happens outdoors: An outdoor cleanup is the best-case scenario for all involved, but that still means you should be careful removing the feces. If it\u2019s possible, Dr. Chavez suggests trying to have your dog poop on sand or grass, since this is the easiest to clean and the threat of transmitted disease is lessened. \u201cIf on sand or grass, use a thick plastic bag to cover the feces and entrap it, then turn the bag inside out immediately, trapping the feces in the bag,\u201d he said. \u201cTie the open end of the bag together and discard into a wastebasket as soon as possible. Some bags even have additional features that provide protection like double layers on the end in contact with the feces, and draw strings.\u201d Whatever bag you use, be certain it\u2019s new, and doesn\u2019t have any holes or punctures. Of course sand or grass isn\u2019t always readily available for pooping purposes, so if your pup ends up on another type of surface (gravel or asphalt, for example), and it\u2019s an area frequented by people (especially children), remove the poop in the same manner as above and consider washing down the surface with water and diluted bleach, if possible, to kill any bacteria or protozoa, and then scrubbing the area with a metal brush. If it\u2019s in an obscure area, however \u2014 like the middle of a busy street \u2014 remove the dog poop, but it\u2019s probably not necessary to scrub with bleach, as the bacteria will eventually die on its own without the potential hazard of being touched by people.\u00a0 If dog poop happens indoors: Cleaning dog poop on your new carpet or your grandmother\u2019s old reclining chair comes with its own set of issues, but all is not lost. If it\u2019s diarrhea you\u2019re dealing with, Bill Masters, owner of Diamond Carpet Care, suggests scraping up as much of the feces as you can, and then allowing it to dry out overnight. \u201cThe next day, scrape up again,\u201d he says Then use a solution of 2-3 drops of Dawn dish soap, 3 oz. of white vinegar and 16 oz. water. Pour the solution directly onto the stain and allow it to sit for three minutes before laying a folded towel on top and blotting as needed.\u201d You might need to repeat the solution another time to ensure that the spot is lifted, and then use a dry towel to blog the area dry. Solid poop will of course be easier to remove than diarrhea, but it still might require some extra elbow grease on your part. For solid messes, Mike Sheridan, senior technician with Randy\u2019s Carpet Care, suggests using a solution of white vinegar and water mixed 50/50, after you clean the area, to neutralize the PH so the stain doesn\u2019t brown as it dries. (Another bonus to vinegar? It kills germs!) Finally, when the mess is clean, put a spray nozzle on your brown hydrogen peroxide bottle and give the area a good misting, but don\u2019t saturate it (which could leave a stain). \u201cPeroxide is great for organic stain removal, and it also helps prevent browning,\u201d Sheridan added.\u00a0 If dog poop lingers on your pet: If you find that your dog\u2019s poop has had some lasting effects on his person, the best thing to do is give him a bath with warm water and dog shampoo. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have dog shampoo, a mild human shampoo like Johnson &amp; Johnson Baby Shampoo will work,\u201d says Dr. Chavez. \u201cMost bacteria area killed by soap and warm water.\u201d Of course wearing gloves \u2014 like dishwashing gloves, for example \u2014 while doing so is never a bad additional precaution. At the end of the day, if your dog is healthy, the threat of your dog\u2019s poop harming yourself or others is greatly minimized. \u201cHealthy, clean dogs make healthy, formed stools, which are safer and easier to clean up,\u201d says Dr. Chavez. \u201cThe best way to reduce any risk of cleaning up your dog\u2019s poop is to feed him a high quality diet that isn\u2019t contaminated in the first place, to keep your dog in good health and monitor his fecal consistency.\u201d Learn about \u201cthe 4 Cs\u201d of dog poop: How Should My Dog\u2019s Poop Look?
