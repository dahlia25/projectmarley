And every day, pet parents\u00a0go through the task\u00a0of cleaning up and disposing of feces. But do you know how to dispose of dog poop properly? Whether you scoop it with a shovel or pick it up with a poop\u00a0bag, there are a few things that pet parents need to know about the daily ritual.\u00a0 Let&#039;s separate\u00a0the fact from the fiction about disposing\u00a0of pet poop. Fact Flushing dog poop down the toilet \u2013 without a bag, only the waste \u2013 is perhaps the best disposal method, says the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the\u00a0National Resources Defense Council. Leaving pet waste on the ground increases public health risks by allowing harmful bacteria and nutrients to wash into storm drains, and eventually into local waterbodies. But cat feces should never be flushed, as it may contain Toxoplasma gondii, a\u00a0parasite that can infect people and animals. Municipal water treatment systems do not always kill this parasite. Fiction Leaving dog poop behind is good for the soil. Reality: In order for feces from a carnivorous animal to be used as an effective fertilizer, it has to be fully composted with other materials such as egg shells and grass clippings and allowed to break down over time. Fact America&#039;s 78.2 million dogs collectively deposit 10 million tons of waste per year, according to waste clean-up service,\u00a0Doody Calls. That\u2019s enough to fill some 268,000 tractor trailers. Fiction Dog waste cannot harm your health. Reality: Dog feces can carry a host of disease and worms -- including heartworms, whipworms, hookworms, roundworms, tapeworms, parvovirus, giardia, salmonella, and even E. coli. This is why it\u2019s imperative to clean it up after Fido does his duty. Fact If not flushing (again only bagless dog poop, never cat waste), it\u2019s best to use a biodegradable bag and place in the garbage. Fiction Bagged poop can be flushed. Reality: It can clog home plumbing and stress sewer systems."}]
