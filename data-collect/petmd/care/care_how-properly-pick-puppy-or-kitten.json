Pick one up incorrectly, however, and you risk causing injury or losing her trust. \u201cIt is important to remember that they are delicate creatures who need us to be careful as we pick them up and carry them around,\u201d she adds. So what precisely, is the correct way to pick up that little ball of fluff? Our experts weigh in on proper technique, practices to avoid, and how to tell if you\u2019re picking up a puppy or kitten the wrong way. \u00a0 Best Practices for Picking Up a Puppy or Kitten Learning to properly pick up a puppy or kitten makes handling easier as time passes, says Pam Johnson-Bennett, owner of Nashville-based Cat Behavior Associates. \u201cFor cats and smaller breed dogs, being picked up will be necessary throughout their lives, so take the time now to do gentle training,\u201d she says. \u201cUsing the proper technique, do short training sessions that end on a positive note. Soon, the puppy or kitten will see that being picked up and held has a purpose and is a part of the bond you share.\u201d The safest way to pick up a puppy or kitten, Downing says, is the one most comfortable for them. \u201cSlip one hand between the front legs from the front of the body, and slip the other hand between the rear legs from behind,\u201d she recommends. \u201cThen lift them as a unit with their spine relatively straight.\u201d If working with a tiny animal that can fit in one hand, she says you can slip your hand under the middle of the chest with your fingers facing the head so that the chest cavity fills your palm. \u201cThis supports them at the largest part of their torso and helps them feel both safe and secure,\u201d Downing says. Heights can be scary for baby animals. \u201cOnce you have them off the ground, tuck them into your body to reassure them that they will not fall,\u201d she says. Dr. Susan Jeffrey, a veterinarian at Truesdell Animal Care Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin, says she likes to \u201cscoop up\u201d pets when she picks them up. \u201cThe motion allows me to put my hand underneath the abdomen and chest, giving them support and stability.\u201d Sitting down at floor level is another suggested way to protect those fragile bones from falls, while helping them feeling secure. \u201cEspecially for kids, it\u2019s best that they pick up a puppy or kitten while sitting on the ground,\u201d says Dr. Jason Nicholas, chief medical officer at Preventive Vet, based in Portland, Oregon. \u201cThat way, if the puppy or kitten wiggles out of their arms, it\u2019s a much shorter distance that they\u2019ll drop.\u201d Should you let kids pick up a puppy or kitten? It depends on the child\u2019s age, our experts agree. \u201cIf you have young kids, do not allow them to pick up (young or old) animals,\u201d Jeffrey says. \u201cIt may be dangerous for both the child and the pet.\u201d What to Avoid Puppies and kittens don\u2019t like surprises, Nicholas says. \u201cBe careful not to startle a puppy or kitten or pick them up too quickly, as this can cause them to panic and fall, or even turn and bite.\u201d Knowing which areas not to pick them up by is also essential. \u201cYou definitely don\u2019t want to pick a puppy or kitten up by their legs, and\u00a0even\u00a0sometimes picking\u00a0them up by their armpits can be uncomfortable and less secure,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd yes, never pick up by their collar or tail.\u201d Picking up an animal by the leg or tail can result in a dislocated limb or broken leg, says Downing, who has dual board-certification in pain management, and veterinary sports medicine and rehabilitation. \u201cAlso, this will be uncomfortable enough for the pet that they may decide that humans hurt them, and they may actually learn to resent being handled at all,\u201d Downing says. \u201cThis can completely undermine the human-animal bond, and fracture the loving relationship between pet and family.\u201d You may have seen images of cats being carried by the scruff, but this is innaprorpaite and could cause significant harm to the pet. \u201cCarrying by the scruff of the neck is something only the mother cat should do,\u201d advises Bennett. How to Know If Your Technique Is Wrong Cats and dogs naturally wiggle when picked up, says Jeffrey, whose professional interests include preventative care. \u201cBut if they are uncomfortable, they may cry out, try to bite or scratch, or even growl,\u201d she says. \u201cThey may also try to escape, but that doesn&#039;t always mean they&#039;re uncomfortable. It just may mean they don&#039;t want to be held.\u201d Do not repeteadly attempt to pick up, chase, or grab an animal after she has given you signs that she does not want to be held. This can cause more overt evasive behavior or fear. Flaying or crying out can also indicate pain or a sense of not feeling feel safe, says Dr. Patti Iampietro, a staff veterinarian at Best Friends Animal Society. \u201cWhen this happens, put them down immediately,\u201d she advises. \u201cLet the puppy or kitten calm down and relax.\u00a0Then try again in a different manner being more gentle or supportive. Every puppy and kitten is different and each will have a preferred method of being picked up and held.\u201d \u201cIt is tempting to pick up a puppy or kitten just any old way,\u201d Downing says. But doing this can have serious consequences. Learning the correct way to pick up and hold a puppy or kitten can help prevent injury and fatality\u2014and help strengthen your bond for years to come."}]
