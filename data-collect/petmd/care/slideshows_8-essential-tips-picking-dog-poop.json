It\u2019s messy and smelly, but cleaning up is a very necessary part of being a responsible pet parent. Dog waste carries harmful microorganisms that can have a major impact on wildlife and the environment, so picking it up is not only good manners, in most locations it\u2019s the law. The following tips will help you get down and dirty with all things poop-removal related. You\u2019re ready to embark on weekly yard cleanup, and even though you know your dog has been eliminating at least twice a day every day, you can\u2019t seem to find a single pile! Rather than wandering aimlessly, start in the corner of your yard and work methodically across your property. Walk in a straight line from one corner of your yard to the other, scanning the ground not only in front of you (to avoid stepping in it) but also on either side of you. Zig-zag carefully, picking up after your dog along the way, until you\u2019ve covered the entire space. Some dogs like to put distance between their piles, while others are creatures of habit that prefer to deposit in the same vicinity over and over. No matter what your dog\u2019s pooping preference is, scour the entire surrounding area once you find a single pile. It\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll find others either very close to the original pile, or within the general region. Your dog is off leash at the dog park and decides to do his business on the other side of the field from where you\u2019re standing. You\u2019re a responsible pet parent, so of course you\u2019re going to clean it up, but when you get to the spot you can\u2019t locate the evidence. The best strategy to assist with long-distance pickups is to find a landmark like a branch on the ground, fence post or plant that\u2019s close to where your dog is doing the deed. That way you\u2019ll be able to close in on the precise spot quicker when you get there. If you walk your dog at night, or are in the process of potty training a young puppy, you\u2019re probably well-acquainted with the challenges of finding deposits in the dark. Rather than relying on the moon and squinting at the grass, grab a flashlight so you can zone in on the pile quicker.\u00a0 You know if your dog is a wandering pooper (meaning, she travels as she goes), so don\u2019t shirk on picking up the extra nuggets that fall outside the main pile, no matter how small they are. Similarly, if your dog\u2019s stools are loose, do your best to \u201cexfoliate\u201d the grass or sidewalk under the business. Sure, even modest cleanup efforts are appreciated considering that some people don\u2019t pick up after their dog at all, but stepping in hidden poo residue can be just as offensive as stepping in a full pile. We\u2019ve all used grocery store bags to clean up, and while picking up poop is always the right idea, this tool isn\u2019t necessarily the best one for the job. Plastic bags stick around for years\u00a0and actually \u201cpreserve\u201d your dog waste in landfills. While there is no perfect solution for cleaning dog waste, biodegradable bags are a much more environmentally-friendly option. These bags are made from recycled materials and eventually break down, some types within a year. Flushable poop bags might seem like an even better option, but many waste systems, whether municipal or septic, can\u2019t handle the unique properties found in canine excrement, like extra hair. Research your bathroom setup before flushing your dog\u2019s deposits. Waste is waste, and waste is compostable, right? By now, it should be clear that dog waste is in a category by itself. Unfortunately, the constant heat required to kill the parasites present in dog poo far exceeds what the typical DIY composting set-up can produce. It is possible to compost dog waste in the right conditions, but even then it should only be used as fertilizer for ornamental plantings, not edible plants.\u00a0 Because dog waste contains so many parasites, it\u2019s critical that indoor \u201cnumber two\u201d accidents are properly sanitized. An odor eliminator created for pet messes will tackle the smell, and an environmentally friendly, dog-specific disinfecting cleanser will kill the dangerous parasites. Remember, even though it might look clean it doesn\u2019t mean that it actually is clean until you take care of the invisible nasties. \u00a0 Victoria Schade is a certified dog trainer and author."}]
