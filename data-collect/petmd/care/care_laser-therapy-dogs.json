So when your pet is uncomfortable or in pain, alleviating his distress is more important than anything else. Laser therapy for dogs can help in many cases by promoting healing and reducing inflammation and pain. This increasingly popular treatment option goes by many names: red-light therapy, photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) and low-level laser therapy (LLLT). So how and when can it help pups to recover? Benefits of Laser Therapy for Dogs Many canine health issues have responded positively to laser therapy. \u201cTherapeutic laser is used to treat a myriad of conditions, including osteoarthritis, intervertebral disc disease, lick granuloma, cellulitis, and others, in dogs,\u201d says Dr. Robin Downing, hospital director of the Windsor Veterinary Clinic in Colorado. \u201cIn fact, any place we find inflammation and/or pain, we can apply the principle of photobiomodulation,\u201d she says. Dr. Erin Troy, owner of Muller Veterinary Hospital in Walnut Creek, California, agrees that dog laser therapy reduces pain and inflammation and promotes the healing of many tissues in the body, including skin, ears, gums, muscles and tendons. Veterinarians are also using laser therapy for dogs as part of their multimodal approach to address ear infections, which often recur or become chronic. Dr. Downing says that laser therapy for dogs can also help with: Surgical wound healing Traumatic wound healing Increasing the metabolism of specific tissues Reducing the formation of scar tissue Immunoregulation Improving nerve function and nerve regeneration Releasing of painful trigger points Speeding the healing of infections How Does Laser Therapy for Dogs Work? Therapeutic laser therapy uses light energy, which is cold or low-level, to work its \u201cmagic.\u201d Light used at specific frequencies causes a physiological change at the cellular level, explains Dr. Troy, an integrative veterinary practitioner. These changes can include replenishing adenosine triphosphate (ATP, the molecule that carries energy in the cells of every living being), reducing inflammation and decreasing pain transmission. While the exact method of action for laser therapy has not yet been identified, it is thought that, in essence, it provides a \u201cjump start\u201d to the cells needed for healing and other body processes. What to Expect During a Dog Laser Therapy Session During a typical treatment, the pet will lie on a padded bed or blanket on a table or the floor, says Dr. Downing. \u201cI generally deliver my treatments on my own, using a handheld device, with the animal simply reclining,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes the owner positions himself or herself by the patient\u2019s head and pets them while we chat during the treatment.\u201d Both the dog and the people in the room must wear goggles to protect their eyes while the laser is in use. How Long Does Each Laser Therapy Session Last? Dr. Downing says that the length of a single laser treatment depends on the power density of the laser unit but is usually under one minute per site. Lasers are categorized into four classes, with Class 4 delivering the highest power output. According to Dr. Downing, the most commonly used therapeutic lasers in veterinary medicine are Class 3 and Class 4. The higher the power of the laser, the shorter the time that is needed to deliver a particular dose of energy into the animal\u2019s tissues. How Many Laser Therapy Treatments Will Your Dog Need? The frequency of dog laser therapy treatments varies depending on the type of laser used, the\u00a0disease being treated, and whether it is a chronic or acute issue. Typically, Dr. Downing treats her patients two to three times per week for two to three weeks, and then reduces the frequency depending on the outcome she achieves. For very acute, painful conditions like a ruptured anal gland, she treats the dog daily for three to five days, then several times the next week, and then increases the time between treatments until she\u2019s attained her set goal. The first treatment for surgical wounds is done before the animal even wakes up. How Much Does Dog Laser Therapy Cost? The costs of the procedure can also fluctuate. \u201cSingle treatments typically cost anywhere from $40 to $100 each,\u201d says Dr. Downing. \u201cMost practitioners bundle treatments and provide a discount to make the treatments more affordable. Then the treatments can be used at whatever pace seems optimal for the patient.\u201d The fee often also includes other forms of care. The Research Behind Dog Laser Therapy Although laser therapy has been available for 40 years, evidence to support its use for alleviating pain and accelerating healing has only recently emerged, says Dr. Downing. As more robust studies have been carried out, interest in therapeutic laser for treating various conditions has grown dramatically, Dr. Downing explains in an article published by the Integrative Veterinary Care Journal. In one study, dogs with interdigital follicular cysts (painful nodular lesions) on their feet responded well to laser therapy. Another study, conducted by The Canine and Conditioning Rehabilitation Group, reported that wound healing in dogs significantly progressed with LLLT treatments. Using Dog Laser Therapy With Other Treatments Laser therapy for dogs can be a big part of a multimodal pain management program, says Dr. Troy. \u201cIt can be paired with acupuncture, massage, chiropractic care and hydrotherapy, as well as with medications and supplements.\u201d Because laser therapy increases the comfort and mobility of the pet with relatively few side effects, it can help when a patient that\u2019s in pain also has heart, kidney or liver disease that prohibits the dog from using traditional therapies like prescription pet medications, Dr. Troy adds. Not only can it be paired with other therapies, but it should be, Dr. Downing says. \u201cTherapeutic laser complements other pain management strategies\u2014both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic,\u201d she says. Risks of Dog Laser Therapy A therapeutic laser shouldn\u2019t be used in certain cases, Dr. Downing says. For instance, applying a laser over a tumor site could accelerate the tumor growth. If a cancer has metastasized, meaning it\u2019s spread to other areas, laser therapy should not be used, as there is a possibility of targeting cancer cells which could then accelerate the cancer growth. It also shouldn\u2019t be used over the uterus of a dog that\u2019s pregnant, either. Although some types of low-level lasers are advertised and sold for use at home, Dr. Downing advises against treating your own dog. \u201cAn effective therapeutic laser is a powerful medical device and must be utilized/applied by medical professionals,\u201d she says. \u201cMany different decisions go into creating a treatment protocol for a particular condition for an individual patient. Lasers of such low power that they cannot cause any negative outcomes are ineffective in creating photobiomodulation.\u201d In other words, if a laser is so weak that it is perfectly safe for home use, it probably can\u2019t do much good. Dr. Troy adds that many effective therapeutic lasers can cause burning of the retinas, and some can cause burning of the treated tissues if used incorrectly. That\u2019s why owners should always seek dog laser therapy treatment from a reputable veterinarian. Once dog owners understand what therapeutic laser treatments do and witness how they work on their dogs, they are all in, Dr. Downing says. \u201cNo matter where we encounter pain in our patients, and no matter the reason for their pain, therapeutic laser can generally make a contribution toward improvement,\u201d she says.
