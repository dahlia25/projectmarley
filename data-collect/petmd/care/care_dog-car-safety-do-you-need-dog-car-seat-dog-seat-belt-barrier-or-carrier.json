In addition, 41 percent of drivers allow their dogs to sit in the front seat, and only 5 percent\u00a0have a pet safety system set up in their vehicle. &quot;Dogs should be safely and comfortably restrained during all car trips to protect everyone involved\u2014no one plans on having an accident, but accidents occur,&quot; says\u00a0Dr. Carol Osborne, DVM, an integrative veterinarian\u00a0and\u00a0owner of\u00a0Chagrin Falls Pet Clinic. &quot;Dogs roaming around in your vehicle can inadvertently cause an accident, and you can both be injured as a result.&quot; And even if a dog doesn\u2019t cause an accident, they can be severely injured or injure others if they become airborne. And although it\u2019s hard not to let your canine ride in your lap with his head hanging out the window, in the event of an accident, you\u2019ll both be glad to have dog car safety gear, Dr. Osborne says. Here are four dog car safety options for your dog and tips on choosing the most appropriate one for your furry family member. Dog Seat Belts A dog seat belt\u00a0is an option for both small and larger dogs, provided that the seat belt is attached to a the back of a safety dog harness\u00a0using a clip, explains Dr. Elisa Mazzaferro, DVM,\u00a0adjunct associate clinical professor of emergency-critical care at Cornell University Veterinary Specialists in Stamford, Connecticut. \u201cA seat belt should never be passed through a [regular] harness or collar to prevent the pet from moving around the vehicle,\u201d says Dr. Mazzaferro. Dr. Mazzaferro further explains that the dog harness should securely fit around your dog\u2019s body. \u201cSafety harnesses should be fitted so that two fingers can easily be slipped around the collar, under the back\u00a0and around the armpits,\u201d says Dr. Mazzaferro. If you already have a dog car safety harness, you can get something like the\u00a0Kurgo direct to seat-belt tether\u00a0to secure him to the back seat. Otherwise, you can get the full package with something like the\u00a0Kurgo Tru-Fit smart harness with steel nesting buckles. When choosing a dog seat belt harness, Dr. Osborne says you should make sure you pick one that is durable and can withstand a bit of wear and tear. \u00a0She explains that chewing helps many canines to relieve anxiety, and this can take a toll on the dog harness. \u201cGenerally, higher quality harnesses are made to endure mischievous canines.\u201d While seat belts work for most dogs, they might not be the best option for tiny dogs. \u201cIf you have a\u00a0toy\u00a0breed, the seat belt may work, but it could be uncomfortable for your dog, as they may not be able to overcome the tension in the seat belt,\u201d says Dr. Osborne. \u201cIf you have a\u00a0toy\u00a0breed, a carrier or crate is the best way to travel in the car.\u201d Dog Crates and Dog Carriers If your dog is tiny or too active to remain seated, a dog carrier might be the way to go when it comes to car safety for dogs, according to Dr. Osborne. \u201cIf your dog can comfortably fit in a carrier and you can secure the carrier in your vehicle, then that\u2019s generally your best choice,\u201d she says. Dog carriers\u00a0like the\u00a0K&amp;H Pet Products travel safety pet carrier\u00a0can be\u00a0securely fastened to the seat,\u00a0so there\u2019s no chance of them shifting around during the drive. A dog crate that can be secured in the back of an SUV or secured to a seat is also a safe choice for transport of larger pets riding in vehicles, according to\u00a0Dr. Mazzaferro. \u201cThe cage should be just large enough for the pet to stand up and lay down and turn around,\u201d says\u00a0Dr. Mazzaferro. \u201cCrates and carriers are also preferred for animals with any back or neck injury to help avoid sudden pressure on the back or neck from a harness in a sudden braking situation.\u201d Dog crates\u00a0come in all sizes and materials, but options such as the\u00a0Pet Gear Travel-Lite soft pet crate\u00a0and the\u00a0Cool Runners Pet Tube soft kennel car crate\u00a0offer padded comfort and protection during a trip in the car.\u00a0 Dog Car Barriers A dog car barrier\u00a0works especially well for larger cars such as SUVs to keep your dog all the way in the back of the vehicle, but it can also be used to separate the front seat from the back seat in any vehicle. \u201cThe barrier option gives your dog a secure space in which they can feel secure and want to relax and lay down,\u201d says Dr. Osborne. \u201cIf you have a \u2018nervous Nellie,\u2019 keeping her secured behind a barrier is also\u00a0good\u00a0idea.\u201d Dog car barriers such as the\u00a0MidWest wire mesh universal car barrier\u00a0and the\u00a0Walky Dog guard adjustable car dog and cat barrier\u00a0are also good options for large dogs that cannot be safely restrained on the seat or in a crate. \u201cGreat Pyrenees, for example, would be hard to restrain without a barrier, although they may be able to lay across the back seat if they are calm,\u201d Dr. Osborne adds. \u201cSome dogs that are escape artists may also benefit from a barrier.\u201d Booster Dog Car Seats Booster dog car seats\u00a0can work well for securing your dog, provided that the seat belt attachment is adjusted to not allow your dog to move out of the booster seat, according to\u00a0Dr. Mazzaferro.\u00a0 Dog car seats may be better for smaller dogs that are more likely to allow restraint, but only if you don\u2019t end up getting distracted by having your pet in the front seat.\u00a0Dr. Mazzaferro\u00a0adds, if the pet is in the front seat, \u201cthe passenger airbag should be turned off to avoid it from being deployed and injuring the pet during an accident.\u201d Front dog car seats like the\u00a0HDP Deluxe Lookout dog, cat and small animal booster car seat\u00a0allows your pet to look out the window without being able to jump out of his safe space. If having your pet in the front seat is likely to be a distraction, Dr. Osborne recommends moving the booster seat to the back. \u201cIdeally, booster seats should be placed in the back seat like a booster seat for a child, as the front seat is far less safe in the event of an accident,\u201d says Dr. Osborne. Options like the\u00a0Solvit car seat cuddler\u00a0are perfect for the back and still help your pet get a better out-the-window view than usual."}]
