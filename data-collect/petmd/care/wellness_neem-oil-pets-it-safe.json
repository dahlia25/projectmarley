But does it live up to the claims? And even if it does, is it safe to use on your furry family members? While veterinarians say neem oil can benefit some animals, there are also limits to what it can do. Before trying it on your dog or cat, learn the risks involved and how to use it safely and effectively. What Is Neem Oil? Neem oil is a carrier oil extracted from the neem (Azadirachta indica), a tree native to Sri Lanka, Burma, and India, and now grown in tropical regions around the world. Ayurvedic practitioners use most parts of the tree to treat various conditions, says Dr. Lisa Pinn McFaddin, medical director at Independent Hill Veterinary Clinic in Manassas, Virginia. In the United States, oil from the seed is used, most commonly as a topical application. \u201cCold pressed oil is the preferred method of oil extraction, and the oil varies in color from yellow to brown to red.\u201d Neem oil contains properties like omega-6 and omega-9 essential fatty acids and vitamin E, but most of its benefits are attributed to triterpenes, Pinn says. (Triterpenes are a chemical compound in plants and animals that allows them to manage inflammation.) \u201cThe most common triterpenes are azadirachtin and nimbin,\u201d she says. \u201cAzadirachtin is a powerful insecticide. Nimbin is known to have anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, antifungal, antihistamine, and fever reducing properties.\u201d These benefits come with a drawback, however. \u201cWhile there are many properties of neem that make it attractive to want to use, those who use it quickly fall out of love with it due to the strong odor, and difficulty in working with pure product,\u201d says Dr. Melissa Shelton, holistic veterinarian and owner of Crow River Animal Hospital in Howard Lake, Minnesota. Experts liken the smell to garlic, even in its diluted form. Can Our Pets Benefit from Neem Oil? Neem oil is most reliably used as a repellant. \u201cNeem oil can be used topically to repel and kill common biting insects, including mosquitoes, biting midges, and fleas,\u201d says McFaddin, who is an integrative veterinarian. It\u2019s questionable whether neem oil is effective at repelling and killing ticks, she adds. Its effectiveness depends on a number of factors. \u201cThe ability for neem oil to be antimicrobial and antiparasitic is variable pending the degree of susceptibility of the organism for which it is being used to deter and the concentration, frequency, and duration of the product\u2019s use,\u201d says Dr. Patrick Mahaney, veterinarian and owner of Los Angeles-based California Pet Acupuncture and Wellness.\u00a0 Vets advise against using neem oil\u2014or any other herbal remedy\u2014as a sole repellant, and say it should be used in conjunction with traditional preventives. \u201cMosquitoes, fleas, and ticks carry life-threatening diseases such as heartworm, Babesia, Bartonella, Lyme disease, tapeworm, and many more,\u201d says Dr. Danielle Conway, a nutrition resident at the University of Tennessee, College of Veterinary Medicine in Knoxville. Pet parents who do opt for neem oil as their only repellant should be diligent about regularly checking their pets for parasites, she adds. Blood testing every three to six months is recommended for pets who are not on a monthly medicated flea, mosquito, and tick preventative, says Dr. Katie Grzyb, medical director at One Love Animal Hospital in Brooklyn, New York. \u201cTests will monitor for heartworm and tick-borne disease,\u201d she says. \u201cThe earlier the diagnosis, the easier and less expensive the treatment in most cases.\u201d Some of neem oil\u2019s properties\u2014azadirachtin, nimbin, essential fatty acids, and vitamin E\u2014suggest that it might also be effective in treating ringworm, local demodectic mange, hot spots, soothing inflamed skin, and reducing itch, says McFaddin. \u201cHowever, there are no studies documenting the efficacy of neem oil for the successful treatment of these conditions.\u201d How to Use Neem Oil Neem oil should only be used topically and ingestion should be avoided, our experts stress. It\u2019s available commercially as topical tinctures, sprays, and shampoos, McFaddin says. Not all products are equal, however. \u201cThese products are not generally regulated and purity of the ingredients may be questionable,\u201d she adds. This is why buying neem oil from a trusted source is essential. If you (and your pet) can stand the smell, you can try to make your own solution at home. Proper dilution is critical, with most vets in agreement that the final product should not contain more than 1 percent neem oil. \u201cPet owners can make their own spray or shampoo having neem oil in a 1:10 part dilution with another oil like olive or almond,\u201d offers Mahaney. Conway recommends a do-it-yourself product suggested in Veterinary Herbal Medicine, a reference book by veterinarians Susan Wynn and Barbara Fougere. \u201cPet parents can make their own topical products by adding 25mL of oil to 400mL shampoo, or adding 1 cup of neem leaf to 1 liter of water, bring to a low simmer for five minutes, and use as a topical spray daily.\u201d Grzyb recommends testing a small area on your pet prior to treating the inflamed regions to see if he has any allergic reaction to the product. Risks of Using Neem Oil At the proper concentration, neem oil is generally considered safe. \u201cNeem oil is not listed as a toxic plant product for cats or dogs as per the ASPCA Poison Control Center or Pet Poison Helpline, yet I always recommend cautious use with all dogs and cats under the guidelines of the pet\u2019s primary veterinarian,\u201d Mahaney says. Another reason to consult with your pet\u2019s vet, and a reminder that natural is not necessarily synonymous with safety, is that \u201cneem oil can interact with insulin, some oral diabetic medications agents, and thyroid hormone supplementation medication,\u201d McFaddin says. Because the risks of using undiluted neem oil are not known, Mahaney doesn\u2019t recommend pet parents use concentrated products. \u201cIf a pet owner is to make their own dilution, then the 1:10 dilution factor should be used.\u201d In its undiluted form, neem oil can potentially irritate the skin surface, especially on already-irritated skin, or if left on for more than 24 hours at a time, he says. \u201cAdditionally, if a non-diluted or sufficiently diluted product is used on a pet and the product is consumed, then a pet could exhibit [excessive] salivation, appetite changes, vomiting, or other health concerns.\u201d Neem oil has mostly been used on dogs and horses with a fairly wide safety margin, Shelton says. \u201cCats have not used neem as widely, and for now, we would still recommend caution, as cats groom much more than other species (and are more likely to ingest it).\u00a0Until safety data and veterinary use is documented further, we would suggest refraining from use of neem unless guided by a veterinarian.\u201d If your pet is in distress after you apply neem oil\u2014signs include vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, respiratory distress, or convulsions\u2014Conway says you should discontinue use. Neem oil can aid in repelling and killing parasites, but vets recommend against relying on it as your only source of insect repellant. Whether neem oil offers a safe and effective way to treat other conditions is questionable at this point. As with other herbal remedies, there just isn\u2019t enough data available for its use in companion animals. When in doubt, always ask your vet."}]
