From how to feed your baby to how to put her to sleep, there are plenty of opinions out there\u2014and many of them sound a little suspect.\u00a0 One area that\u2019s especially confusing? Newborns and pets. Although you\u2019ll likely hear them from well-meaning friends and family, these common myths about pets and babies simply aren\u2019t true. \u00a0 Pets Can \u201cSense\u201d a Baby Is On The Way We love our pets, and we like to think we have a deep, special bond with them. While this may be true, there is no sixth sense to alert them that there\u2019s a baby in that bump. The only thing your cat or dog knows is that changes are happening at home\u2014and changes can be scary. \u201cThe vast majority of our\u00a0pets\u00a0notice our behavior change more than any physical change,\u201d says Shanna Rayburn, a certified veterinary technician who specializes in behavior. \u201cDifferent things like schedule changes due to doctor\u2019s appointments are the start of things. Then, when new items start showing up in the house, the big awakening begins.\u201d With this in mind, it\u2019s important to transition your house and routine as soon as possible. \u201cOne of the biggest things you can do to help prepare is to get the new schedule in place well before\u00a0baby\u00a0comes,\u201d says Rayburn. \u201cIf your dog is fearful of new items or has separation anxiety, it is really important to start the changes as soon as you know you are expecting.\u201d Litter Boxes Are No Big Deal One of the biggest debates surrounding babies and pets is the\u00a0cat\u00a0litter box. But anyone who tells you that cleaning the litter box while pregnant is perfectly safe, is not telling the whole truth. Litter boxes can host Toxoplasma, a parasite that is a threat to unborn babies. Pregnant women can be exposed through ingestion of feces from an infected cat. Even the microscopic amounts that might get on your hands while cleaning a litter box can pose a threat. While some sources advise simply washing your hands, Berger recommends that expectant mothers keep their distance. Whenever possible, \u201cpregnant women should stay away from dirty cat litter and should not clean the box.\u201d she says. If your partner is new to cat litter duty, make sure he or she knows how to keep it clean and up to your cat\u2019s standards. Cats and Babies Don\u2019t Mix Ever since Lassie rescued Timmy on television, dogs have had the family stamp of approval. Cats, however, never quite made it to the baby mainstream\u2014on the contrary, there\u2019s an ugly rumor that cats, attracted to the scent of milk, intentionally smother infants in their cribs. While your cat might attempt to get into the crib, his motivation isn\u2019t sinister. \u201cMany cats love to snuggle up and lay right next to the\u00a0baby,\u201d says Dr. Jeannine Berger, a veterinarian and vice president of Rescue and Welfare at the San Francisco SPCA. \u201cThe bed is soft and the baby\u00a0is warm.\u201d However, she cautions that pets and babies should never be left alone, regardless of how well they seem to get along. Your Baby Will Be Treated As &quot;Part Of The Pack&quot; Just as cats get a bad rap, we tend to give our dogs too much credit when it comes to children. Just because you love your new baby doesn\u2019t mean your dog will see her as \u201cpart of the pack\u201d and instinctually accept her. In fact, newborns are inherently unsettling to dogs. \u201cBabies\u00a0are loud, smelly, and fling their limbs around without thought,\u201d says Rayburn. \u201cThis is all fear-inducing [behavior] for dogs. Even the best dogs can snap if they are afraid.\u201d Introductions between babies and dogs should be gradual and all interactions should be supervised."}]
