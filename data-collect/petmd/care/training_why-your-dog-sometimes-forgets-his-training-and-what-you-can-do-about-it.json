You\u00a0know\u00a0your dog knows how to do it; it was the very first thing you taught him! You ask him to do it several times a day, in fact, and he always complies. So, what gives when he doesn\u2019t? How come it seems like your dog sometimes \u201cforgets\u201d his training? The first question you should ask yourself in situations where it seems like your dog is blowing you off is, \u201cDid I teach my dog the full behavior, or just a very specific version of the behavior?\u201d For example, let\u2019s say that you taught your dog to stay before you put his dinner bowl down and he knows how to hold while you fill his bowl and walk it over to his dinner spot. Awesome! But do you ever ask your dog to stay in other situations? Meaning, can he hold a stay when you open the door to get a package? Or when your kids are chasing each other around the dinner table? Asking your dog to stay in those types of situations is vastly different than doing his rote \u201cI do\u00a0this\u00a0then\u00a0this\u00a0happens\u201d daily pre-dinner stay. It\u2019s up to you to help him increase his stay \u201cfluency.\u201d To do so, imagine all of the different scenarios where you think it would be helpful for your dog to stay\u2014beyond that dinnertime stay\u2014and work towards achieving them as a team. Speaking of fluency, have you ever taken a language class? Initially your teacher walks you through the basics of grammar, then you move on to speaking simple sentences, and then eventually you and your classmates can have very basic conversations. You start to feel confident in your abilities. Now imagine that you and your class take a field trip to a market in the country you\u2019re studying. Suddenly, everything you learned in the classroom no longer applies. Everyone is talking too fast, the accent sounds strange, and everyone is crowding you. It sounds like a frustrating and scary scenario, right? The exact same thing happens to our dogs when we take them out of the \u201cclassroom\u201d and into the real world. Asking your dog to do a \u201csit\u201d around your house is very easy for him because he\u2019s comfortable and familiar with the environment. Asking your dog to sit at the vet office, however, is an entirely different experience. Just like the sights and sounds might overwhelm you in a foreign country and make you \u201cforget\u201d your burgeoning language skills, the same goes for your dog. The vet office is fraught for a dog. The smells, sounds and not-so-happy memories there are enough to override the basic training you\u2019ve done together. It\u2019s not a case of your dog being willfully disobedient when he \u201cignores\u201d you in this type of scenario, it\u2019s more likely that your dog is overcome by the surroundings. The same holds true in the dog park. There\u2019s a lot to sniff and explore! Sometimes the environment trumps the trainer and your dog might \u201cforget\u201d to respond when you call him. An easy way to help your dog remember his manners is to make sure that his responses are close to perfect when in a familiar environment, like your yard. This is your important foundation training\u2014don\u2019t skip this step! Then you can practice at the park when it\u2019s not prime-time and filled with other dogs. Visit the park in the early morning or in the evening when the environment is less distracting and practice the recalls using a very special, high value treat. Try to set your dog up for success by initially only calling him when he\u2019s not fully engaged with another dog. Finally, look deeper when it seems like your dog is \u201cforgetting\u201d his training. I\u2019ve worked with many dogs that are uncomfortable when they try to do a sit-stay on hardwood floors. It might seem like these dogs are blowing me off when I ask them to do it and they hesitate, but they\u2019re actually trying to avoid slipping and sliding all over the place! (We opt for a down-stay instead.) Some dogs are superstitious about household equipment, so they don\u2019t want to respond to a recall if you\u2019re standing right next to the noisy fan. And sometimes pain might be a mitigating factor. An older dog might not want to do a down because it hurts him when he has to get back up. Simply observe your dog and consider all of the possible influences before you blame him for insubordination. Believe it or not, your dog is not trying to be willfully disrespectful when you ask him to do something and he \u201cforgets\u201d how. If you\u2019ve done a good job with your dog\u2019s basic training and he doesn\u2019t respond to a cue when you ask, there are usually other factors at play that make it challenging for him. Figuring out the how and why behind the refusal will make life easier for both you and your dog. Victoria Schade is a professional dog trainer.
