But is it a good idea? Balconies can be dangerous places for cats and dogs; they run the risk of falling, getting burned by a hot grill or ingesting toxic house plants. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that the balcony is off-limits to your best friend. By taking a few precautions and practicing due diligence, you can keep her safe while enjoying some time together outdoors. Can Cats and Dogs Fall from Balconies? Both cats and dogs are at risk of falling from balconies, although it\u2019s more common with cats, says Dr. Sonja\u00a0Olson, a senior clinician in emergency medicine for\u00a0BluePearl Veterinary Partners. Cats and dogs can squeeze through balcony railings, but cats are more prone to jumping onto and over them, Olson adds. Although cats have an innate reflex to right themselves and land on their feet, they aren\u2019t immune from harming themselves, says Dr. Lori Bierbrier, medical director of community medicine at the ASPCA. In fact, she adds that balcony injuries are so common in cats that a term has been created for it: high rise syndrome. In one report of 119 cats who had fallen from high rises during a four-year period, about 97 percent survived, but many sustained serious injuries, including 46 percent who presented with fractured limbs. In addition, a balcony doesn\u2019t have to be very tall for it to do damage. \u201cFolks may not think that two stories is that high, but yes it is,\u201d says Olson. Even a one-story fall can sometimes cause injuries, she says, \u201cespecially with dogs, who are not as graceful and \u2018springy\u2019 as cats.\u201d Balcony Risks and Dangers for Pets Falling is the primary balcony hazard for pets, says Bierbrier, and can cause injuries including broken bones, skin abrasions and damage to internal organs. It can also be the cause of soft-tissue sprains and facial injuries like trauma to the nose and teeth, split palates and broken jaws, says Olson. Even if your pet isn\u2019t injured in a fall, she may run away and get lost (another good reason to get her microchipped), Olson adds. \u201cYour pet\u2019s ability to escape from the balcony is [what makes a balcony] dangerous,\u201d she says. \u201cOnce out of that space, you no longer have control over what they can come into contact with or what they could ingest, for example.\u201d Falling isn\u2019t the only potential danger. Burns from heated grills, exposure to toxic plants, bees, wasps and other insects, and getting a head or limb caught in a railing are also risks to be wary of, says Bierbrier. Can My Cat or Dog Go on the Balcony? Provided you\u2019re willing to take steps to prevent mishaps and watch her closely, your cat or dog can enjoy time on the balcony. Before you head outside, take a good look at your balcony setup. The safest balconies are those with screened-in enclosures (like catios), says Olson. These enclosures won\u2019t be effective, however, if she can escape from it, so inspect it carefully for tears or gaps. \u201cPets are ingenious escape artists,&quot; she adds. If you do opt for a screened-in enclosure, Olson recommends making sure your companion has an approved cat or dog door so they can get back inside the home. \u201cAlso, make sure they have food, water and shelter from the sun.\u201d Look carefully at any other items that may be potentially hazardous to animals, such as grills. Additionally, \u201cConsider the ornamental plants that may be placed on the balcony and make sure they are not toxic plants,\u201d Olson says. You\u2019ll also want to move furniture away from balcony edges to prevent animals from using it as a way to jump over the railing, Bierbrier says. \u00a0 Finally, consider keeping your pet in a harness or on leash when they\u2019re on your balcony, says Olson. \u201cSo if they suddenly pursue that bird flying by or the squirrel in the tree nearby, they do not fall off the balcony railing or go through the balcony slats.\u201d Regardless of any precautions you take, experts stress the importance of supervising your companion while on the balcony. It takes just one moment of not being vigilant for an animal to harm herself. \u201cMoney spent on harnesses, leashes, or other supplies that make a balcony more secure can save a pet\u2019s life, and save pet owners hundreds or thousands of dollars,\u201d says Bierbrier."}]
