Here are some tips for turning your dog\u2019s crate into a canine castle that will make every tail wag.", "articleBody": "Dog crates\u00a0should be safe, comfy places for your canine companion to relax. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to choose dog supplies\u00a0for your dog\u2019s crate that turn it into the ultimate doggy den. When a dog crate is thoughtfully outfitted with the right crate accessories\u00a0(like cozy crate mats!) it can feel like a restful retreat. Create a Secure and Tranquil Crating Experience \u201cWhen crate training is done properly, most dogs enjoy spending time in their crates and actually view the crate as their own special place. The most important thing is to make the crate a pleasant experience from day one,\u201d says Kelly Armour, a certified trainer and behavior analysis specialist and owner of The Virtuous Dog LLC in Reading, Pennsylvania. She says that for the first few days with a new dog, if possible, you should plan to be at home, giving your new companion the reassurance of your presence and spending time on positive training. \u201cWhile keeping the crate door open, toss dog treats\u00a0into the back and let your pet discover them at his own pace.\u201d Animal behaviorist Alice Moon-Fanelli, PhD, CAAB, of the\u00a0Brooklyn Veterinary Hospital\u00a0in Brooklyn, Connecticut, cautions, \u201cSome individual dogs and some breeds of dogs are more prone to resisting being crated than others. Proper introduction to crating greatly influences whether a dog not only accepts but is comfortable being crated.\u201d \u00a0 Armour emphasizes that, \u201cCrating should never be viewed as punishment. Keeping a new pet safe and out of trouble while you are getting familiar with each other and adapting to new routines is good for both the pet and pet parent.\u201d Choose the Right Crate for Your Dog Like our own beds, sofas, and chairs, both style and sizing for comfort are key to finding the right dog crate for your pet. \u201cSpecifics about crates have variable answers depending in part on the breed and the individual dog&#039;s temperament,\u201d says Moon-Fanelli. \u201cSoft-sided crates are comfortable\u00a0and convenient for dogs that don&#039;t chew.\u201d For adult or adolescent dogs who are already house-trained, Armour recommends \u201ca crate that is large enough for the dog to comfortably sleep and move around, with enough room for some special enrichment toys and treats like a\u00a0KONG, bones, etc.\u201d \u201cFor elderly animals, I prefer to use a much larger crate so that they have plenty of room to move, stretch, and reposition,\u201d Armour says.\u00a0 For dogs who are house-training\u00a0(and possibly struggling), the general rule is that the dog crate should be just big enough to give your dog room to lie down and turn around. \u201cMost dogs do not like to sleep in a soiled area, which is why the area should be small,\u201d Armour says. She reminds pet parents that when house-training your dog, frequent potty breaks are critical.\u00a0If you\u2019ll be away for hours at a time, a midday dog walker is a must for giving your pup those breaks outside his dog crate. Ensure Your Pup Is Comfortable Once you\u2019ve found the right style and size of dog crate, it\u2019s time to upgrade from empty space to cozy place with a few basics. Start with a spot for resting. \u201cSome dogs chew and ingest their bedding; others snuggle up,\u201d Moon-Fanelli says. \u201cKnow your dog to avoid injury and unnecessary veterinary visits.\u201d If dogs do tear up their bedding, Armour says the reason likely stems from \u201clack of exercise or proper enrichment (such as toys, training, and exercise) before going into the crate for a period of time.\u201d So if your dog likes to shred plush dog toys\u00a0or is an avid chewer, you might want to choose a more simple dog crate mat as opposed to stuffed, plush one. When you are choosing a mat or dog bed for your dog\u2019s crate, you should keep the size of the crate in mind. The dog mat or dog bed you choose should not impede your dog\u2019s ability to move or rest comfortably. It should allow them to get cozy as well as move around to find a resting position that they find comfortable. Provide your dog with access to a\u00a0dog bowl\u00a0for fresh water\u00a0and\u00a0some crate-appropriate toys\u00a0to keep them preoccupied while inside the crate. \u201cMake the crate an interesting place to be by providing KONG toys or other special, long-lasting treats when your pet is in the crate,\u201d Armour suggests. Interactive dog toys\u00a0can be great additions to your dog\u2019s crate because they engage your pup in fun activities that he can do by himself. The\u00a0KONG Extreme Goodie Bone\u00a0is a great option for crate time because it can be filled with peanut butter and frozen for long-lasting fun. You can also try a dog toy like the\u00a0Pet Zone IQ treat ball dog toy, which can be filled with dog treats or dog food\u00a0to keep your dog happy and occupied while in the crate. Help Your Dog Feel Safe Keeping your dog comfortable inside his crate is key. \u201cFor warmer months, or if you have a heavy-coated animal, a crate fan is an excellent option,\u201d Armour suggests. \u201cYou want to carefully attach or position a fan to a crate so that it provides good ventilation but is not blowing directly on the animal in a way that he cannot move away if he feels too cool or uncomfortable.\u201d She reminds dog parents to avoid common hazards, such as placing the crate in direct sunlight or too close to a heat source where your dog cannot get relief from overheating. \u201cAnd removing collars and harnesses is critically important to prevent a device from being snagged or caught in the crate,\u201d she says. Armour says that covering a crate at night or to give a dog quiet time is also ideal. \u201cThe most important thing to remember is that a cover can cause a crate to heat up and should only be done if someone is home to supervise, since it\u2019s important to make sure the pet gets proper ventilation.\u201d There\u2019s a benefit for you, too. Moon-Fanelli says that if a dog accepts a cover on his crate, the resulting quiet may allow owners to sleep in, as \u201cit might minimize exposure to outdoor sounds and slow the dog&#039;s awareness of sunrise.\u201d Provide Plenty of Exercise Before Crate Time If your adult dog must be crated for a long period\u2014as in, a full work day\u2014Armour recommends that he get at least\u00a030\u201360 minutes of exercise\u00a0before going into his crate, as well as a walk with a dog walker to break up the day. Even as your dog accepts his crate time, he\u2019ll always look forward to his favorite time of all\u2014time spent with you. Featured Image: iStock/Christine McCann"}]
