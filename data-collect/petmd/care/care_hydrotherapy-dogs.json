Find out what hydrotherapy for dogs involves, how it works and which conditions it can help treat.", "articleBody": "Hydrotherapy for dogs is a type of physical therapy where dogs perform certain exercises in water at a rehabilitation center under the supervision and direction of a certified hydrotherapist. Hydrotherapy for dogs can only be done at a rehabilitation clinic under the supervision of a certified hydrotherapist, oftentimes after you receive a referral from your veterinarian. Do not attempt hydrotherapy for dogs on your own under any circumstance. There are canine hydrotherapy centers popping up all over the United States, and many veterinarians see hydrotherapy as beneficial in certain cases. Some of these benefits include improved injury recovery, weight loss and increased mobility. If you think your dog can benefit from hydrotherapy, first talk with your veterinarian about whether dog hydrotherapy is the right option to pursue for your pet. If it is, they can point you to a reputable dog hydrotherapy facility. Here\u2019s an explanation of what canine hydrotherapy involves, how it works, what conditions it can treat and the two types of therapy available, as well as some precautions. What Is Hydrotherapy for Dogs? \u201cIn the most general terms, hydrotherapy is exercise in an aquatic environment [that is] used to achieve functional goals in rehabilitation,\u201d says Dr. Molly Flaherty, DVM, a staff veterinarian specializing in physical rehabilitation medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine in Philadelphia. \u201cHydrotherapy rehabilitation helps modify soft tissues\u2014ligaments, tendons and muscles\u2014to improve a dog\u2019s ambulatory mechanisms and make him or her as comfortable as possible,\u201d says Dr. Francisco DiPolo, DVM, CVA, CCRT and director of Water4Dogs Rehabilitation Center in New York City, which offers dog hydrotherapy to its canine patients. This doesn\u2019t just involve strength training, he notes; it also helps find and correct compensatory movements\u2014like a limp\u2014that could cause further injury or harm. What Conditions Can Canine Hydrotherapy Treat and How Does It Work? Dr. DiPolo says that veterinarians typically prescribe hydrotherapy to either promote healing after surgery or to treat muscular or neurological conditions. At the most basic level, dog hydrotherapy is used to strengthen muscles and improve range of motion. Hydrotherapy\u2019s success in these areas can be attributed to two factors, according to Dr. Dr. DiPolo. \u201cIt allows us to target the muscles we want to strengthen or stretch while simultaneously minimizing discomfort.\u201d \u201cWhen pets are in water, they become buoyant, which means they have less weight to carry,\u201d which makes these movements less painful and helps dogs go through the full range of motion, he says. Water also adds a level of resistance to the exercises, making a dog\u2019s muscles work harder and build strength faster. Dr. Flaherty adds that dog hydrotherapy is typically done in warm water, which helps dogs relax and keeps them from experiencing muscle spasms. These benefits can be applied to many physical ailments; canine hydrotherapy has been used to treat dogs with musculoskeletal pain, arthritis, orthotic problems and neurologic issues. Sometimes, dog hydrotherapy is used in conjunction with pet pain medications\u00a0and joint and hip dog supplements\u00a0as part of an overall treatment plan designed to improve a dog\u2019s mobility. Hydrotherapy Can Help With Weight Loss Hydrotherapy can also be beneficial for weight loss. \u201cExercise can be really taxing if a dog is carrying extra weight, which can make it very difficult to start that dog on a healthy path. Hydrotherapy lessens their weight burden and makes exercising more comfortable, so it\u2019s easier for a dog that previously did not exercise to get started,\u201d Dr. Flaherty explains. She adds that weight loss is often one of the reasons that a dog owner might pursue hydrotherapy, especially if their dog is very overweight. \u201cKeeping dogs mobile is extremely important to a dog\u2019s health,\u201d Dr. Flaherty says. \u201cIt helps with their energy and it helps them feel good.\u201d Types of Dog Hydrotherapy There are two main types of hydrotherapy for dogs: underwater treadmills and pool-based therapies. Dog Water Treadmills \u201cUnderwater treadmills are probably the best-known type of hydrotherapy,\u201d Dr. Flaherty says. To get started, the dog walks onto a treadmill in an empty tank; then, the tank is filled to the desired level with warm water. \u201cWhat\u2019s great about underwater treadmills is that they allow for a lot of adjustments, depending on the dog\u2019s needs. For example, if the treadmill tank is filled to about hip-level, it\u2019s as though more than half of the dog\u2019s body weight has been taken away, which is great if he has painful joints,\u201d Dr. Flaherty explains. Dr. Flaherty says that therapists can also add or remove water, change the pace of the belt and otherwise optimize therapy for each individual animal. \u201cCustomizability is key,\u201d she notes. Pool-Based Hydrotherapy for Dogs There are also pool-based therapies. \u201cI would recommend this type of therapy if any type of weight-bearing is painful for the dog,\u201d Dr. Flaherty says. \u201cIt\u2019s also nice for dogs who have multi-joint arthritis\u2014the buoyancy just helps them relax.\u201d Pool-based therapies are also helpful if a dog has forearm issues because their forearm range of motion while swimming is greatly exaggerated. Dog Hydrotherapy Precautions As mentioned above, hydrotherapy can often be prescribed after surgery to help with recovery. Dr. Flaherty says that after surgery, a dog usually has to wait 10-14 days before beginning hydrotherapy, until the sutures or staples are out and the incision has closed. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to interfere with the healing of the incision or risk contamination,\u201d she says. There are also some breeds of dogs for which hydrotherapy might be a little more difficult. Brachycephalic breeds, like Bulldogs and Pugs, might have more trouble than others due to the breathing issues that stem from their flat faces. However, Dr. Flaherty notes that any dog undergoing hydrotherapy will be under very close supervision. \u201cFor these dogs, we might start them on the treadmill because there\u2019s much more control, but hydrotherapy is prescribed on a case-by-case basis, so we wouldn\u2019t suggest it for a dog that couldn\u2019t handle it.\u201d Contraindications of Canine Hydrotherapy Dr. DiPolo notes that canine hydrotherapy may not be a good fit for some dogs. \u201cFor pets with unstable spines, swimming can put a lot of stress on the cartilage between the vertebrae. If you\u2019re not careful, a dog with a little bit of back pain could become paralyzed,\u201d says Dr. DiPolo. He adds that the same goes for certain joint and ligament injuries. \u201cThe way dogs kick in a pool, as well as how they get in and out of the pool, can break injured ligaments completely, which then requires surgical intervention.\u201d Dogs with cardiovascular problems also might not be a good fit for dog hydrotherapy. \u201cIn this case, excessive aerobic activity can be detrimental,\u201d Dr. DiPolo says. While these contraindications could be quite serious, Dr. DiPolo doesn\u2019t want to make pet owners overly paranoid. \u201cIf your pet is has some type of injury, just be sure to go to a legitimate hydrotherapy center. It\u2019s always good to have an expert supervising therapy to minimize complications.\u201d By: Kate Hughes Featured Image: iStock.com/BanksPhotos"}]
