Gun owners must take careful precautions to ensure that loved ones are kept out of harm\u2019s way. These precautions don\u2019t just extend to human members of a household\u2014pets should also be kept in mind when practicing responsible firearm habits. \u201cFirst and foremost, firearms should always be treated with respect,\u201d says Dr. Michael Moss, a veterinarian at Central Pennsylvania Veterinary Emergency Treatment Services in State College, Pennsylvania. \u201cTreat all guns as if they\u2019re loaded, even if you are certain that they are not. And never\u2014NEVER\u2014point them at another person or pet.\u201d Using a Gun Safely Preventing firearm-related accidents requires that gun owners exercise restraint when on hunting excursions. \u201cThis sounds like common sense, but never shoot in the direction of a dog\u2014or person, for that matter\u2014that\u2019s in cover,\u201d Moss says. \u201cYou might not be able to see the dog, but that doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t accidentally shoot him.\u201d Moss is a hunter himself. When he\u2019s on hunting trips, he always tells his companions that no game is worth unsafe shooting practices. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a safe shot, let it go,\u201d he says. \u201cThere will always be another chance.\u201d If you want to hunt with your dog, Dr. Daniel Inman, a veterinarian at Burlington Emergency Veterinary Specialists in Williston, Vermont, suggests outfitting your pup with a bright orange vest. \u201cIt\u2019s the best way to ensure your dog doesn\u2019t get mistaken for game,\u201d he says. Storing a Gun Safely Moss\u2019s foremost recommendation is to never bring a loaded gun into your house. \u201cThey should always be unloaded before they come indoors,\u201d he says. Once the gun is inside, it should be locked up somewhere safe. The same goes for ammunition. \u201cPets are curious,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially dogs. They\u2019ll eat almost anything, even cartridges. Dogs are very bright animals, but sometimes even the brightest dog does something stupid.\u201d Inman adds that while pets cannot pick up a gun and fire it like a child might, they can knock it off a table if it\u2019s left unattended and cause it to accidentally discharge. \u201cAnimals are very unpredictable,\u201d he says. \u201cThey can jump on you without warning, or decide to explore an area they\u2019ve never expressed an interest in before. For these reasons, it\u2019s definitely best to keep animals and firearms separated.\u201d Cleaning a Gun Safely Both Moss and Inman say that the very first thing gun owners should do when cleaning their firearms is to check that the gun is not loaded. Then, they should check again. \u201cI\u2019ve seen several cases in which gun owners accidentally injure their pets because they didn\u2019t know their guns were loaded when they were cleaning them,\u201d Inman says. Moss concurs. \u201cI have read so many articles about people who have firearm accidents when cleaning a loaded gun,\u201d he says. \u201cAlways check to make sure a firearm is unloaded before handling it in this way.\u201d And, once a gun owner commences cleaning her firearm, she must be careful that she doesn\u2019t accidentally point it at her pet. \u201cRemember, pets exist on a lower plane than people. If you point a gun at the floor when you\u2019re cleaning it, you may think you\u2019re being safe, but that is where your pet is,\u201d Inman says. To ensure everyone\u2019s safety, he recommends that pets be kept in a separate room when firearms are out and being cleaned. Inman adds that a lot of the solutions used to clean guns may be caustic, making them extremely dangerous if pets were to ingest them. \u201cCaustic solvents serve a purpose, which is to break up dirt and debris. Beyond being poisonous, if swallowed, these solvents can cause irritation and inflammation to an animal\u2019s esophagus and stomach. This means that if a dog or cat swallows them, you don\u2019t want to induce vomiting because it could cause serious damage the esophagus.\u201d Inman reiterates that pets, firearms, and firearm cleaning products should be kept separate to avoid any issues. However, if a pet does manage to eat some cleaning product, Inman first suggests learning what the active ingredient is in that product, and then reaching out to poison control for further guidance. \u201cSome products may only cause some minor gastrointestinal upset. Others may require IV fluids and supportive care,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to figure out what you\u2019re dealing with before taking action.\u201d"}]
