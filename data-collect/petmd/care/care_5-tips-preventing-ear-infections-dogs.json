Learn some simple ways to help prevent dog ear infections at home.", "articleBody": "By Paula Fitzsimmons If your pup has floppy ears, allergies, or happens to be an avid swimmer, you\u2019re probably no stranger to canine ear infections. Ear infections in dogs are not uncommon, but using simple, preventive tips can help stop ear infections from developing. If you suspect your dog has an ear infection, call your vet. \u201cPrompt veterinary care is essential to avoid more serious consequences such as a ruptured eardrum, middle or inner ear infection, and hearing loss,\u201d says Dr. Alli Troutman, a holistic veterinarian at Integrative Veterinary Service in Brookfield, Wisconsin. Symptoms of ear infections in dogs are hard to miss. \u201cThe affected dog is usually shaking his head frequently, may tilt his head with the sore ear usually on the \u2018down\u2019 side, and there is often a sour odor coming from the ear,\u201d says Dr. Beth Boynton, Professor of Wellness at Western University College of Veterinary Medicine in Pomona, California. \u201cIt may look swollen, red, and full of moist discharge.\u201d Spare your dog some needless suffering and avoid the expense of extra vet trips with these safe and effective vet-approved tips for preventing ear infections in dogs. 1. Rule Out Underlying Causes An ear infection is typically a sign that something else is going on with your dog, says Dr. Alexandra Gould, a veterinarian with Dermatology Clinic for Animals in Tacoma, Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s only through treating these underlying causes that ear infections can be prevented.\u201d Causes, she says, include allergies, foreign objects stuck in the ear (like foxtail grasses), hormonal and autoimmune diseases, and tumors. Very often, allergies are responsible.\u00a0\u201cSkin allergies bring inflammation to the surface of the body which causes irritation and warmth. The confined space of the ear canal breeds yeast and bacterial growth that further increases the inflammation,\u201d and can lead to ear infections explains Dr. Michael Lund, veterinary staff manager for ASPCA\u2019s Community Medicine Department in New York. Like us, dogs can react to any number of allergens in the environment, like pollen, grass, mites, and fleas (another reason to protect your dog with proper flea and tick prevention). And what you feed your dog may be the problem, says Boynton. Some dogs have food allergies or food sensitivities, which can predispose them to ear infections. \u201cDogs in the United States most often react to beef, dairy products, and wheat,\u201d she says. 2. Keep the Ears Dry \u201cYeast and bacteria thrive in warm and moist environments\u2014and many dog ears prove to be the perfect Petri dish,\u201d\u00a0says Lund. This is especially true for breeds like Cocker Spaniels and Retrievers, whose floppy ears trap moisture. He says the best preventive for these types of dogs who are predisposed to ear infections is cleansing and drying the ears every five to 10 days. If your dog is a swimmer or is bathed regularly, clean his ears as soon as possible after water exposure. \u201cThis ensures the moisture is adequately removed to prevent yeast and bacteria from getting a chance to colonize the ear canals.\u201d Dr. Jill Abraham, a board-certified dermatology specialist with Blue Pearl Veterinary Partners in Midtown, New York, suggests placing a cotton ball in the ears during bath time to keep them dry. \u201cYou don&#039;t have to push the cotton ball in deep, it can rest at the opening of the ear.\u201d After the bath, remember to remove the cotton ball and dry the ears. \u201cAfter a bath, you can use a dry paper or cloth towel to dry the inside flap and around the opening of the ear canal.\u201d 3. Keep the Ears Clean To clean the ears, Abraham suggests the following routine. Lift up the earflap, then fill up the canal with a vet-recommended solution, or soak a cotton ball with solution and squeeze the liquid into the canal. After gently massaging the base of the ear for 20 to 30 seconds and letting your dog shake his head, use dry cotton balls or soft towels to wipe off debris. \u201cYou can use cotton-tipped applicators in the folds inside the ear flap, but don\u2019t insert any into the ear canals,\u201d she says. \u201cThis could push wax and infection deeper down and damage the ear drum.\u201d What Is the Best Ear Cleaner for Dogs? Lund advises against home-made ear-cleaning solutions like diluted hydrogen peroxide, vinegar, and rubbing alcohol. \u201cAt-home remedies are often half water, and water in the ear is what can predispose many dogs to ear infections.\u201d Instead, ask your vet for a recommendation based on your pet\u2019s specific needs.\u00a0\u00a0 4. Consider Supplements Of course there is no substitute for a nutritionally complete diet made from high quality ingredients, but the following supplements may be used as part of your strategy for preventing ear infections. Always check with your veterinarian before feeding your dog supplements. If allergies are at the root of your dog\u2019s ear infections, a daily omega-3 fatty supplement can help. These supplements can reduce inflammation, which may lessen the risk of ear infections, says Lund. Omega-3 fatty acids, like those found in fish oil supplements may \u00a0\u201cdecrease inflammation associated with skin allergies that often appear in a dog\u2019s ears and feet.\u201d A malfunctioning immune system can make your dog more prone to infections, so maintaining balance is essential. A probiotic supplement can balance the normal bacterial flora within the intestinal tract and promote an appropriate immune response. \u201cA healthy gut is a happy gut, and a happy gut is a healthy immune system,\u201d says Troutman. 5. Reconsider Plucking Ear Hairs Plucking your dog\u2019s ear hair can be beneficial, but it\u2019s not appropriate for every dog. \u201cI stick by the old adage, \u2018If it ain&#039;t broke, don&#039;t fix it,\u2019\u201d says Abraham. If a dog has healthy ears and has not had infections, she often advises pet parents not to pluck. \u201cBut, if a dog with very hairy canals keeps getting ear infections then it can help to keep the canals free of hair.\u201d If you do decide to pluck hair from your dog\u2019s ears, this is probably not something you want to try at home, unless you\u2019re experienced. Overly-aggressive plucking could lead to pain and cause more ear problems. \u201cI don&#039;t advise pet owners try plucking ear hairs at home on their own. This is best performed by a groomer or veterinary professional.\u201d Learn More:"}]
