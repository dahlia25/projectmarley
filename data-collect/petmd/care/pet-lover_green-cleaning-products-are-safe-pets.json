That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to do your homework in determining which products, such as household cleaners, best suit the needs\u2014and safety\u2014of your family. Toxins in Cleaning Products According to the\u00a0American Lung Association, many cleaning supplies and household products can irritate the eyes and throat and can cause headaches and other problems, including cancer. The\u00a0American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals\u00a0typically finds household products to be in the top ten most common cause of acute toxicosis in pets. These household chemicals include, but are not limited to, cleaning products, laundry detergent, and paint. Dr. Branson Ritchie, DVM, of the University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine and co-director of the Infectious Diseases Laboratory, explains, \u201cAny material that\u2019s considered toxic for your family should also be considered a risk for your companion animals. Birds and reptiles are particularly sensitive to aerosolized toxins and can often serve as sentinels for environmental toxins. \u201cYou should take the same precautions to protect your pets from chemicals that you would for your children.\u201d There is no such thing as a product without chemicals, so a label advertising &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;green&quot; does not automatically equal a healthier or safer product. For example, pyrethrin is a natural flea product that is non-toxic to dogs, slightly toxic in cats, and extremely toxic to fish. If there is a good chance that any pet or human could ingest or inhale a cleaning product, it&#039;s best to find an alternative product. Not All Labels Mean Safe for Pets Keep in mind that green, or eco-friendly, cleaning products are not all the same. There are countless meanings and uses of the word \u201cgreen,\u201d and some products labeled this way may still contain toxins for pets. Finding out which chemicals are being used, and if they are safe for use around pets, is indeed the best way to keep your family safe in the home. Nontoxic Cleaning Products Many pet families choose green cleaning products that are safe for pets and the environment. There are plenty of cleaners on the market today that are highly rated, eco-friendly, and safe for you and your pets. When using any chemicals, a residue is left behind. Keep in mind, pets use their mouths to clean themselves, which increases the potential to ingest a potentially harmful substance that comes in contact with their fur or paws. \u201cIt\u2019s better for your pets and for your family to use non-toxic materials in any enclosed space,&quot; says Dr. Ritchie. &quot;If you do need to use chemicals, read the label thoroughly so that you know the dangers associated with that chemical. And be sure you, your family and your pets are in a well-ventilated space.\u201d Using only non-toxic, pet-safe green cleaning products is not only pet-friendly, but it\u2019s also environmentally and home-friendly, too. When a pet mess occurs in outdoor spaces, consider a cleaner like\u00a0Simple Green outdoor odor eliminator, which uses naturally derived microorganisms to neutralize and eliminate pet waste odors. This product is highly rated for grass,\u00a0synthetic\u00a0turf, decks, and patios. Plant-Based Cleaners Non-toxic plant-based products clean your home without the unpleasant and potentially harmful residue that can be found in conventional cleaners. Plant-based cleaning products are made with naturally derived, safe, and biodegradable ingredients, often using sustainable manufacturing practices. Biokleen Bac-Out Stain + Odor remover\u00a0is a solution developed without artificial fragrances or colors, and it works great on almost any surface. It uses live\u00a0enzyme\u00a0cultures, citrus extracts, and plant-based surfactants to clean pet messes. Enzyme Cleaners From everything including urine, vomit, feces, blood, grass, and dirt, non-toxic enzyme cleaners remain top-rated pet stain and odor removers. Enzymes are biological compounds that speed up a chemical reaction. When used in cleaners, they break down biological substances such as urine and feces. This makes them the perfect cleaner for pet messes. Enzymatic cleaners are non-toxic and biodegradable, which means they\u2019re safe to use in any room of your home. There are highly rated enzyme sprays that works on almost any surface. \u00a0 Symptoms of Toxicity in Pets Acute toxicosis secondary to cleaning products is relatively uncommon in pets. However, pets are much lower to the ground, which means they may have a higher exposure to chemicals and fumes. Pets with a pre-existing respiratory condition may be even more sensitive. Regardless of pre-existing conditions, make sure to store chemicals and cleaners in places where even the most curious pet can\u2019t get into them. All cleaning products should be unreachable by pets and children. \u201cSigns of acute or chronic exposure to environmental toxins may include clean\u00a0ocular\u00a0or nasal discharge, sneezing, coughing, itching, skin irritation, and diarrhea,&quot; says Dr. Ritchie. &quot;Be sure to make your veterinary professional aware of any potential toxins you may have used in your home prior to your companion animal developing any of these critical changes. And remember that you can always call the\u00a024/7 Animal Poison Control Center.\u201d Image via iStock.com/CasarsaGuru"}]
