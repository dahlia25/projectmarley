You\u2019re choosing to bring home a new family member that you will love unconditionally. \u00a0 But just because it\u2019s an overall positive and pleasant experience doesn\u2019t mean you should act on a whim. A new dog needs attention, physical and emotional support, and requires new financial commitments. \u201cPets are not an accessory, a fashion statement, or in any way some \u2018thing\u2019 to be tossed to the side,\u201d says Kristi Littrell, adoption manager for Best Friends Animal Society. \u201cDogs are living, feeling creatures who are a member of your family.\u201d \u00a0 In making this life change, you need to be fair to yourself, your human family, and your new dog. So while you\u2019re going through the dog adoption process, make sure you NEVER do these six things. \u00a0 One of the biggest mistakes people make pre-adoption, Littrell says, is making up their mind about what they want before even meeting a dog. \u201cDogs deserve to be treated as individuals, so don&#039;t focus too much on the breed or breed mix,\u201d she says. \u201cTake the time to get to know the particular dog you are considering.\u201d \u00a0 Certain breeds, of course, have common traits: Golden Retrievers might be very friendly. German Shepherds tend to be protective. Bulldogs are usually easy-going. But these are not hard and fast rules, and people with certain preconceived notions, who adopt a dog based on specific personality expectations, might end up disappointed. \u00a0 \u201cTake the dog you are considering on a walk, play with him or her, and talk to the people taking care of the dog to find out their impressions,\u201d Littrell says. While you can\u2019t ever know for sure how a dog will behave in a new environment, you\u2019ll at least see how your personalities mesh, which is crucial to a successful experience. \u00a0 For 95 percent of dogs, being adopted by a family is a very positive development, but for 100 percent of dogs, being adopted by a family is a massive life change. \u201cYou\u2019ve just turned their world upside-down,\u201d Littrell says. \u201cDogs need time to adjust and develop a routine.\u201d \u00a0 While it\u2019s easy to get frustrated during the first few weeks with your new dog, make sure to think about the experience from the dog\u2019s perspective and give him or her time to adjust. Whether you adopt an old dog or a young dog, a male or female\u2014they need time and space to explore their surroundings and feel comfortable. This is especially true for dogs entering a home with other pets in it, Littrell says. \u00a0 How long do you need to wait before becoming concerned about the lack of adjustment? \u201cI always ask adopters to give the animal at least a month, as long as no one is in danger, of course,\u201d Littrell says. \u201cAnd as needed, contact a trainer with positive training methods.\u201d \u00a0 Older dog or puppy? It\u2019s one of the biggest questions new adopters have to take into consideration. There\u2019s no objectively right answer. It just depends on your lifestyle and personal preferences. Older dogs might have more medical problems and expenses, but they will probably require less day-to-day management. Puppies, on the other hand, will probably be with you longer, but need a lot training and attention\u2014especially early on in their lives. \u00a0 To that end, Littrell says people who work super long hours and don\u2019t have anyone at home who can help parent a puppy during the work day should really consider an older dog. \u201cPuppies need tons of socialization to grow up to be healthy adult dogs,\u201d she says. \u201cThey also need potty breaks every [couple of] hours.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 Meeting with a veterinarian shortly after adopting a dog is a must, says Dr. Nicole Breda, lead veterinarian for Boston Veterinary Care at the Animal Rescue League of Boston, in order to assess overall health and establish a baseline for future tests. You\u2019ll also want to have a fecal test done to check for intestinal parasites, as well as routine bloodwork that will evaluate cell counts and kidney and liver health. \u00a0 Breda says a heartworm test is another must. \u201cHeartworm disease is spread by infected mosquitos when they bite a dog. However, it takes up to six months from infection to show up positive on this test,\u201d she says. \u00a0 That means a follow-up is necessary six months later (and every year after that) to make sure nothing was missed the first time around. And you really don\u2019t want to skip that follow-up. \u201cIf a dog is infected with heartworms, the treatment can be very costly, and without catching the disease early, it could be deadly,\u201d Breda says. \u00a0 Breda says a lot of new dog owners think of crating as cruel. While it\u2019s true that new dogs are generally happiest when they\u2019re free to roam and be around their owners, crating them while you leave for the day is important. \u00a0 \u201cI often see young dogs for ingesting items that can cause an intestinal blockage,\u201d she says. \u201cI also see them for eating medication or something toxic when they\u2019re left unattended.\u201d \u00a0 This sounds like a no-brainer, but a lot of people like the idea of adopting a dog more than the reality of it. \u00a0 Breda suggests making a list of the things you\u2019re looking for in a new dog. Bring that with you to a shelter and see if the managers can match you with a furry friend that meets your needs. \u201cThe biggest mistake I see potential adopters making is falling in love with a cute dog on a website without realizing that in reality that dog may not be a good fit,\u201d she says. \u00a0 Littrell adds that some shelters might allow you to foster the dog. It\u2019s a less permanent way to spend a little more time with the pup and see how he or she interacts with you and your family at home."}]
