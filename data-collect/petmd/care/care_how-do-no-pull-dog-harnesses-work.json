Here\u2019s how no-pull dog harnesses can make walks more pleasant for both you and your dog.", "articleBody": "Image via iStock.com/Mark Newton By Linda Rodgers \u201cA dog that\u2019s constantly pulling is frustrating for owners who just want to go on a nice, leisurely walk,\u201d says Mary Huntsberry, a certified animal behaviorist and owner of Helping Pets Behave\u00a0in Gaithersburg, Maryland. If you find yourself being dragged on your daily walks, it might be time to consider your options when it comes to dog walking supplies. A dog harness\u00a0made specifically to discourage pulling, for example, can help you gain more control on your walk and improve your pup\u2019s dog leash\u00a0skills. By using a no-pull dog harness, you can help make walks more enjoyable and prevent your dog from hurting herself. Why Leash Pulling Can Be Harmful If your pup is only wearing an ordinary dog collar, she can put a lot of tension on her throat as she strains forward, especially if you grip the leash or yank it back. This kind of pressure can hurt your dog\u2019s neck regardless of her size, but especially if she belongs to a smaller breed. \u201cLittle dogs can actually do a lot of damage to their very sensitive throats and trachea if they do excessive pulling,\u201d says Mikkel Becker, certified dog trainer and resident trainer for FearFreeHappyHomes.com. Excessive pulling can also lead to unwanted behaviors. Say your dog pulls whenever she sees another dog. If you hold her back, jerk the leash or drag her away, she begins to associate that unpleasant experience with other dogs. \u201cDogs make associations with what\u2019s happening in their environment and whatever they\u2019re looking at, so from their perspective, seeing another dog predicts this unpleasant reaction from their owners,\u201d Huntsberry explains. The result: Every time your dog sees another dog, she becomes uneasy and starts barking. A no-pull dog harness helps end the leash battle between you and your dog so that you can have more peaceful walks. How No-Pull Dog Harnesses Work The best no-pull dog harnesses have straps that cross above your pup\u2019s shoulders and can be fastened at center of your dog\u2019s chest and behind her front legs, says Becker. The dog harness will also have a clip in front for the leash. Once you clip the leash to the front ring and begin walking, your dog has to stay by your side in order to keep moving forward. If she does pull, the leash goes off to the side\u2014not straight back\u2014which directs your dog back towards you. That gives you greater ability to control and guide your dog back to your side by applying a little pressure, she adds. Features to Look for in a No-Pull Dog Harness Standard front clip. One dog harness option available is the PetSafe Easy Walk dog harness. Like other front-clip harnesses, it encourages you and your dog to engage in what trainers call loose-leash walking\u2014when your dog walks by your side in a relaxed manner. A front clip and back ring. Dog harnesses that have rings for clipping a leash on the back and front, like the 2 Hounds Freedom no-pull dog harness and leash, can minimize pulling. Becker explains that having a front and back ring means you can increase and decrease control as needed. As your pup becomes more accustomed to loose-leash walking, you can graduate from using both the back and front rings to just the front ring and then just the back ring. Becker says another benefit is that \u201cYou can clip the leash to adjust to whatever situation you and your dog find yourselves\u2014for example, a crowded sidewalk versus an open green space.\u201d Wider straps. If straps are thin and flimsy, the material is likely to chafe against your dog\u2019s skin if she does pull toward something, says Huntsberry. \u201cA thicker, wider strap is going to better distribute the pressure\u201d so it doesn\u2019t cut into your dog\u2019s skin. Some dog harnesses even have cushioning, like the Frisco padded front lead dog harness, which has wide straps as well as a front and back ring. Cushioning makes a harness even more comfortable for your dog, especially if you own a breed that doesn\u2019t have much fur. How to Get Your Pet Used to a No-Pull Dog Harness Ideally, you want your dog to see the harness as a good thing. Make sure to adjust the straps before you slip it on your dog, since you can accidentally pinch or make your pet uncomfortable if you adjust the harness while it\u2019s on your dog, Becker suggests. You can also get your pup used to any buckling or clipping sounds by introducing them before you put on her harness. Of course, when you slip the harness on, you\u2019ll have to do some further tweaking, so be sure to reward your pup with dog treats\u00a0during the process. Will a No-Pull Dog Harness Stop Pulling Forever? Think of the no-pull harness as a training tool. Yes, it will deter pulling on its own. But ideally, you\u2019ll also be teaching your pet that a loose leash is the only way she\u2019ll move forward, and a tight leash means she has to stop. The key is to reward any positive behaviors. \u201cIf your dog checks in with you by looking in your direction or walks with her shoulder in line with your calf or thigh, reward the heck out of these behaviors,\u201d Becker explains. \u201cThe more these go rewarded, the more likely they are to occur.\u201d Rewards can include treats, but also your attention and slackening the leash. Provide Mental and Physical Stimulation It\u2019s important to make sure your dog isn\u2019t cooped up most of the day with nothing to do. If that\u2019s the case, she\u2019s probably going to pull more once she gets outside because she\u2019s so eager to explore and interact with her environment, notes Huntsberry. You want to give your dog mental and physical stimulation at home, she explains. So play games with your dog and give her appropriate things to chew on. You can offer her bully sticks\u00a0to chew on or provide a dog interactive toy\u00a0for her to discover treats. That may help her expend energy so she feels less of a need to pull when she gets outside."}]
