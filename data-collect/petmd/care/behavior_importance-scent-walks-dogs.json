Here are some facts about your dog\u2019s sense of smell and how to take a \u201cscent walk\u201d that takes full advantage of it. How Dogs Understand Scents Not only do dogs have hundreds of millions of scent receptors as compared our six million, but they also devote approximately 40 times more brain volume to decoding smells than we do.\u00a0 This means that dogs are able to understand scent in a way that\u2019s difficult for us to comprehend. A dog\u2019s sense of smell can be loosely compared to human sight. Dogs smell to gain context of their environment, which includes the unique signature of other beings that have traveled that route before them, as well as elements that are abstract, like the passage of time or pending weather changes.\u00a0 A Dog&#039;s Need to Sniff Is Often Taken for Granted \u201cWe humans simply don&#039;t see the world from an olfactory point of view: we not only can&#039;t smell all that a dog can, we simply aren&#039;t interested in smells in the same way,\u201d Horowitz says. \u201cSo even though we now know that dogs need exercise and socialization, it&#039;s taken longer for us to even see that they need to sniff.\u201d Dogs can be trained to sniff out bombs, bedbugs, and fugitives; they can locate the scat of endangered animals over land, air, and water; and can even detect certain cancers in humans. The scope of their abilities is almost beyond comprehension, which makes the accidental ways in which we discourage our dogs\u2019 sniffing all the more unfortunate. How to Take a Scent Walk Horowitz suggests that there\u2019s a simple way to engage your dog\u2019s scenting abilities: take her on a \u201csmell walk\u201d or \u201cscent walk.\u201d\u00a0 A scent walk changes the focus of the walk from miles covered to odors logged, which probably requires a different mindset for most pet parents. Instead of having a specific destination, the route of a scent walk meanders as your dog absorbs and processes the scents along the way. It\u2019s easy to take a scent walk. Just set off on a path, and when your dog stops for a sniff, let her. Be fully engaged, which means: put away your phone and pay attention to your dog. Horowitz says that it can be challenging for pet parents to be patient while their dogs engage their nose, but if you tune into what your dog is doing, you\u2019ll understand how much she enjoys having the freedom to sniff to her heart\u2019s content. You\u2019ll also likely gain new insights into your dog\u2019s behavior when you take a scent walk. Is your dog a drive-by sniffer, eager to inhale as many new scents as possible? Or does your dog hunker down and dedicate herself to smelling one location with great intensity?\u00a0 As you stroll, allow your dog to select the path and the amount of time she spends on each odor, but remember to keep leash manners in mind and don\u2019t let your dog pull you along. The Benefits of Scent Walks Horowitz says that there\u2019s an important behavioral component that comes into play during scent walks. \u201cI&#039;ve found that when dogs are allowed to use their noses, they actually display a lot less \u2018misbehavior,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIt&#039;s as if the thing that they have decided to be their \u2018work,\u2019 barking at each approaching dog, say, or always being vigilant (and thus anxious) about where you are, can be replaced with this more natural behavior, if they are allowed to sniff. In other words, it makes them happy.\u201d\u00a0 That said, pet parents don\u2019t always have the time to devote to nose-to-the-ground walks. Horowitz says that not every walk you take with your dog has to be a scent walk.\u00a0 She says that pet parents can take their dogs for\u2014and teach them the difference between\u2014typical exercise walks, late night potty trips, and walks with other canine friends without needing to stop and sniff the world along the way.\u00a0 But it\u2019s important to make time for occasional smell walks as well. \u201cJust leave some space for your dog to use their nose,\u201d she says.
