News headlines have highlighted the tragedy that can unfold if a hungry coyote crosses paths with a small, unattended pet. People have reported coyotes snatching their pups from their backyards, causing mass hysteria. But how common are coyote attacks in urban and suburban areas? Is this really something to lose sleep over? We asked the experts to answer burning questions about coyotes, and offer advice on how to keep your pets safe. Are Coyotes a Danger to Pets? While coyotes once lived on untouched lands, the species has spread into heavily populated areas. And this is ultimately why we are hearing more about their growing urban presence today. \u201cCoyotes are found pretty much everywhere now, including urban centers,\u201d says Dr. Shari Rodriguez, assistant professor of human dimensions of wildlife at Clemson University, noting that she has seen \u201can incredible photo of a coyote that got onto a subway car in Portland and curled up and went to sleep on a seat.\u201d \u201cAs we increase human populations and develop formerly green space, wild areas, we are coming face to face with more wildlife, like coyotes,\u201d explains Camilla Fox, founder and executive director of Project Coyote, an organization that strives to foster coexistence between people and wildlife. \u201cThings like habitat encroachment, habitat alteration, and food can be an attraction for different species.\u201d Rodriguez adds that coyotes are generalists, which means they don\u2019t have narrow requirements for habitat, food, and such, like specialist species do. \u201cThis means they can live off their natural prey (smaller mammals like rabbits, squirrels, and even deer fawn, as well as insects, fruits, birds, amphibians, and reptiles), but they can also do fine preying on domestic pets and small livestock, human refuse, and agricultural crops,\u201d she says. And demographic wise, she notes that coyotes have been found \u201ceverywhere from Central America to the Arctic.\u201d So, will a coyote attack a dog? Though everyone seems to have a \u201ccoyote ate my friend\u2019s pet\u201d story, Rodriguez says that these occurrences are still relatively low. \u201cIt does happen from time to time, but it\u2019s not all that common,\u201d she explains. \u201cWhen it does happen, it\u2019s typically because humans are engaging in risky behavior\u2014e.g., leaving/letting their pets outside alone, walking pets at night in urban centers.\u201d And even then, Rodriguez explains that we can\u2019t really place the blame on the coyotes. \u201cI like to think of it this way: A coyote is just being a coyote,\u201d she says. \u201cSo it\u2019s going to do whatever it can to make a living at the lowest possible cost.\u201d Even in urban areas, a coyote will prefer to eat its natural diet of rodents and fruit but may snatch up a pet if the opportunity presents itself as an easy one, Fox adds. \u201cIf a coyote is in an urban area and there is a fat fluffy [pet] that doesn\u2019t have a lot of defense mechanism, cats could be considered prey,\u201d she says. \u201cOnce you allow your pets to roam, they basically become part of the ecosystem, so they may be perceived as prey by any given species.\u201d How to Protect Pets From Coyotes \u201cCoyotes are here to stay,\u201d Rodriguez says. The key to ensuring pet safety is for owners to adjust to their behavior and to take extra steps to keep their animals out of harm\u2019s way. \u201cHumans need to avoid risky behaviors if we are to avoid interactions and conflict with coyotes,\u201d she explains. Here are a few precautions you can take: Be aware that some dogs may be drawn to coyotes: To ensure your dog\u2019s safety in a coyote-ridden area, it\u2019s essential to be aware that coyotes and dogs can be attracted to one another, Fox points out. \u201cA dog and a coyote are genetically similar enough where they can interbreed, though interbreeding is not very common,\u201d she notes. \u201cThere is an attraction often between dogs and coyotes and it\u2019s often the dog that starts the chase behavior. But if an incident occurs, then the coyote gets blamed.\u201d Do not feed wildlife: One of the biggest reasons that coyotes are infiltrating neighborhoods is the attraction of people food, Fox says. \u201cWe encourage people to not intentionally or unintentionally feed animals if they are trying to deter them from their yards and neighborhoods.\u201d Do not leave your pet unattended: Keep an eye on your pet when you open the back door to let him out and do not let him stray too far away from you. Whenever possible, take your dog out on a dog leash. \u201cYou should use a 6-foot leash, not a retractable leash,\u201d recommends Dr. Kate Magers, a veterinarian at Pennfield Animal Hospital in Missouri. \u201cThose give little to no control if your pet encounters a coyote. Also avoid walking your dog during twilight hours.\u201d Rodriguez adds that coyotes are more active at night, so it\u2019s best to keep an extra eye on your pet when you let him out after the sun goes down. \u201cCarry a headlamp or flashlight when walking your dog at night,\u201d she says. Do not feed your pet outside: As food can be a big attractor of coyotes, giving your pet his dinner indoors is always a good idea. \u201cIf you feel you must feed your pet outside, feed midday at a set time and pick up leftovers immediately,\u201d Magers says. Be extra mindful during coyote breeding season: \u201cApril is when the coyotes are going to have their young and April through August is when they are going to be more protective of their young,\u201d Fox says. \u201cBe extra careful during this time. Walk a dog on leash and be cognizant of coyotes in the area.\u201d Remove any kind of attractants around the exterior of you house: Attractants for coyotes include compost, dirty grills, and birdseed, Fox says. \u201cBirdseed, for instance, can attract rodents and, therefore, attract coyotes.\u201d Fallen fruit should also be cleaned up, as Fox notes that coyotes consume large amounts of fruit during certain points in the year. Magers adds that you should secure garbage cans and refuse. Make your yard a less attractive habitat: \u201cKeep trees and shrubbery trimmed to reduce cover, which makes great hiding places for coyotes,\u201d Magers recommends. \u201cInstall coyote-proof fences (these are typically quite high) or use motion-triggered deterrents like light or sprinkler systems.\u201d Fences should be at least 6-foot high and buried at least 6 inches underground or fitted with a mesh apron on the outside of the fence extending 12 inches out from the bottom of the fence and secured with landscape, she adds. Try a coyote-deterring gadget: \u201cThere are lots of new items on the market for protecting pets, such anti-coyote collars and jackets,\u201d Rodriguez says. \u201cThe vests are made of Kevlar and have spikes on the back of the jacket and the collars also have spikes on them.\u201d While both products should help deter attacks, Rodriguez notes that she hasn\u2019t seen any convincible statistics that would allow her to tout their effectiveness. So don\u2019t skimp on the precautions mentioned above. If you see a coyote in your yard, \u201cstand tall and maintain eye contact with the coyote,\u201d Magers advises. \u201cYou should haze the coyote by yelling, clapping your hands loudly, making loud noises, flashing a flashlight, tossing rocks or sticks near the coyote, and anything else that will frighten it off.\u00a0Move toward the coyote quickly and aggressively and do not run away from it.\u201d Rodriguez adds that if you see a coyote while walking your dog, maintain eye contact with it and back up until you and your pet are a safe distance from it. What Do You Do If a Coyote Attacks Your Dog? If your pet gets bit by a coyote, it requires immediate veterinary attention. \u201cSee your veterinarian to have the wounds cleaned, get some antibiotics started, and booster the rabies vaccine if indicated by vaccine records,\u201d Magers says. Although rare, coyotes can carry rabies, Fox notes. \u201cThat is very geographically dependent on which species of wildlife are actual rabies vectors. For example, in California, we haven\u2019t had a case of rabies in coyotes since the early \u201990s. A coyote may become rabid, but it\u2019s much more prevalent in bats, skunks, and raccoons than coyotes in terms of a rabies vector species.\u201d Per Rodriguez, any attacks should be reported to your state\u2019s wildlife agency as soon as possible. \u201cSometimes coyotes get habituated to humans, and thus become more brazen,\u201d she explains. While coyotes can pose a threat to pets, it\u2019s important for people to recognize the fact that these animals are native to North America and a very crucial part of the country, Fox says. \u201cThey play an important role in helping to keep ecosystems healthy and diverse. Coyote management is largely about people management,\u201d she says. \u201cBy taking a few precautions, there is no reason why the two species can\u2019t live together peacefully.\u201d"}]
