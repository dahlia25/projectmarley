Here&#039;s why tinsel is so dangerous to your pet and how you can protect them.", "articleBody": "It\u2019s tempting to go all-out when decking the halls for Christmas, but pet parents need to be mindful of a few holiday hazards. Cats and dogs\u2014especially younger animals\u2014are inquisitive, and the holiday season brings all kinds of new things into the household, from trees and decorations to packaging and new foods. All of these have their own inherent dangers, but one pet safety risk that\u2019s commonly overlooked is tinsel. But what makes tinsel so dangerous? Here\u2019s what you need to know\u2014and why you should skip trimming your tree with this shimmering decoration. What Is Tinsel? Tinsel refers to the strands of shiny plastic or metallic decorations that mimic bits of ice that many of us love to use on our trees and wreaths. Sometimes it comes as individual strands, and other times it comes in longer ropes. Silver used to be the \u201cstandard\u201d color, but in recent years gold, blue, red, and green tinsel have become increasingly popular. Why Tinsel Is Dangerous to Pets Tinsel is incredibly dangerous to both dogs and cats, as well as other household pets who might find it intriguing. Often, the animal starts out playing with the shiny tinsel. This exploration then involves the mouth \u2026 and then your pet winds up swallowing it. Tinsel strands are difficult to chew and do not break down in the gastrointestinal tract. They are surprisingly strong and can become lodged under the tongue or within the stomach or intestine, where they can cause an obstruction or cut through the lining of the digestive tract. For some pets, tinsel will head down the \u201cwrong pipe,\u201d causing them to choke and cough.\u00a0With luck, they are able to actually cough it up and out\u2014eliminating the problem. But sometimes the tinsel remains in the respiratory tract, leading to continued coughing and breathing problems. What To Do If Your Pet Swallows Tinsel So, what happens after tinsel is swallowed? If you\u2019re really lucky, nothing, and your pet simply has some shiny poop a few days later. However, if the tinsel gets hung up anywhere along the way\u2014under the tongue, balled up within the stomach, or strung out in the intestinal tract\u2014we have a problem, Houston. This is a situation veterinarians refer to as a gastrointestinal \u201cforeign body\u201d\u2014something stuck in the digestive tract that doesn\u2019t belong there. Some animals will have only mild signs (or no signs at all), at least to begin with, but other pets quickly become markedly ill. Signs of tinsel ingestion can include: Vomiting Poor appetite Abdominal pain Diarrhea Straining to poop or not pooping at all Lethargy or other changes in behavior Call your veterinarian for advice if you think your fur baby may have eaten tinsel. The sooner a vet sees your pet, the better they can help\u2014so don\u2019t waste any time. Your vet will usually do some testing, including an exam, radiographs, and sometimes an ultrasound. If they confirm a foreign body, it will need to be removed through surgery or endoscopy, depending on where it\u2019s located and how much damage it has done. The vet\u2019s goal is to go in, find, and remove the tinsel as quickly as possible before it can cause more problems\u2014and to repair any damage it did while moving through the digestive tract, which sometimes can be quite severe.\u00a0 How to Keep Your Pet Safe From Tinsel Preventing any tinsel-related blockages is simple: don\u2019t use tinsel in your holiday decorating. Your fur baby isn\u2019t going to eat something that\u2019s not in your house! However, if this decoration is an important part of your holiday rituals, consider using the rope-like tinsel, which is harder for pets to swallow. Placing any tinsel you use\u2014whether the rope form or the strand form\u2014up high and out of your pet\u2019s reach is also helpful. But keep in mind that it can fall off and cats will enjoy climbing the Christmas tree, so you may not even be able to place it high enough to avoid those curious paws! At the end of the day, tinsel just isn\u2019t worth the risk. Featured Image: iStock/golero"}]
