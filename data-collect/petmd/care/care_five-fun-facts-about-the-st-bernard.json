Well, here are five fun facts you may not have known about this lovely breed. In a word, no. This is a fallacy. The St. Bernard didn\u2019t actually ever have a small barrel of brandy about its neck. They should be known as the &quot;dog rescuer,&quot; instead. \u00a0 Gaining their name from the dangerous St. Bernard pass in the Alps between Italy and Switzerland, the breed was famous for rescuing people lost in the snow and in avalanches. This was not an easy or safe job for the St. Bernard, as many perished in the avalanches. Although they\u2019ve only been known as the St. Bernard since the mid-1800s, they are very famous for their rescues. Before that, they were known as &quot;Barry Dogs&quot; and &quot;Noble Steeds,&quot; among others. \u00a0 The most famous St. Bernard was Barry. He rescued somewhere between 45-100 people (the numbers are sketchy) during his career. Barry even has his own monument and his body rests in the Natural History Museum in Berne, Switzerland. All hail Barry! The St. Bernard is one of the giant dog breeds. He is tall, majestic, masterful, strong and muscular. The first body builder of the dog world? Not exactly, but this dog has energy and stamina, perfect for all his past jobs, including farming, watchdog and, of course, search and rescue.\u00a0St. Bernards are also very active (you should probably walk yours twice a day) and love to be involved. Sorry, folks. As far as we know, they don&#039;t do laundry? Oh, the St. Bernard is not all looks and muscles. This is a smart dog. He\u2019s famous for being brainy, even-tempered, non-territorial (though he\u2019ll protect you if there\u2019s danger), obedient, very loyal, and great with kids and even other animals. Because of his size, it is recommended he be trained properly from a young pup. Because the last thing you want is a large dog who doesn\u2019t always obey the word &quot;no,&quot; especially when there\u2019s something really interesting to investigate. Definitely not in personality. This is a warm and loving dog. But because his ancestors spent so much time traipsing the Alps and rescuing wayward travelers from certain death, he is now pretty much a cold weather dog. No tropics for him. The St. Bernard doesn\u2019t do well in warmer weather, or even in really warm rooms, so where you live must come into consideration before you get yourself one. There you have it!
