Gormly Barking can be a noisy nuisance to dog parents (and their neighbors!), and is often tops the behavioral problem list. However, canine vocals aren\u2019t all bad. Sometimes, a barking dog can provide a safety warning and other times, teaching a dog to bark on command can make for a fun party trick. \u201cA lot of people would absolutely want their dog to bark when there are strangers around, or something is out of order in the neighborhood,\u201d said Los Angeles-based certified dog trainer and behavior consultant Jonathan P. Klein. \u201cWhen we teach a dog to do something on cue, the key is to get them to reliably do the behavior one way or another.\u201d How, then, do you teach your dog to bark on command without confusing him or encouraging annoying barking? By teaching a trick and not a bad habit, said Beth McGonigal, certified dog trainer and owner of North Pittsburgh Animal Behavior. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to create a little yappy monster.\u201d She compares teaching dogs to bark to a sweet arrangement she has with one of her dogs, Jefferson. When she says the magic words, \u201cgive mommy some romance!\u201d Jefferson gives her a kiss on the lips, which is fun on command but not something a pet parent would want done all the time. How to Make a Dog Bark Capture the behavior you want and reward it by enticing your dog with a trigger that excites him, like holding a ball or ringing the doorbell. Right before the dog barks, say the command you want to teach (he will then associate the command with vocalizing) then give your dog a treat for barking on command. If he barks but you haven\u2019t said the command, don\u2019t reward him. After a few repetitions, he will begin to realize that if he barks, he will get a treat, said McGonigal, who also uses clickers to train. You can also trigger the bark by doing something that frustrates the dog, like bouncing a ball out of his reach behind a baby gate. After you say the command, you can then reward the dog by giving him the treat of playing with the ball. Repeat the process by rewarding your dog for barking on command then, once he learns the command, reduce the treats and make them more intermittent, Klein said. A common command to teach is \u201cspeak,\u201d but dogs have no inherent knowledge of that English word; they only know it if people teach them to associate it with barking, McGonigal said. Therefore, you can invent a word or phrase of your own to get your dog to bark on command, or just use the simple, \u201cspeak.\u201d How Long Will it Take to Teach a Dog to Bark? Every dog is different, McGonigal says, and knowing your dog is key. Some dogs are more talkative and learn more quickly than others, but in general, a few training sessions should produce results. \u201cBecause barking is a self-rewarding behavior, [dogs] tend to pick up on it a little more quickly,\u201d she said. \u201cThey could catch on in a few weeks. It\u2019s not a very complex behavior.\u201d The training timeframe can also depend on how much training history the particular human and dog have together, Klein said. Consistency is the key to successfully training a dog to bark, he said, which means you must regularly say the magic words and reward your dog for doing what you want. \u201cIf you&#039;re inconsistent, then the dog is not going to put two and two together,\u201d he said. Unfortunately, training your dog to speak a little too well can be problematic, and the amount a trained behavior can be un-trained will depend on the individual dog, McGonigal said. The same principles of training will apply, though this time you\u2019ll be rewarding your dog\u2019s silence with a command that means, \u201cquiet.\u201d Whatever you do, don\u2019t yell at your dog when he\u2019s barking, even if the barking is inappropriate. Just like an argument with a human, when both people are yelling, the exchange becomes heated and unproductive. \u201cYou\u2019ll reinforce the barking by giving it attention,\u201d said Klein. Instead of yelling at your dog for barking, try to identify the stimulus that triggers that inappropriate barking and either remove the stimulus or remove the dog from the stimulus.
