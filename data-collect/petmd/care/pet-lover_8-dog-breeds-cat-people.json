While cat people appreciate their feline companions for traits like independence, intelligence and cleanliness, there are dog breeds that also display these characteristics. There are even dog breeds that can slink around your house with catlike stealth. So, if you are a cat person looking to expand your horizons with a canine companion, here are several dog breeds for you to consider. Shiba Inu  Image via iStock.com/alynst The Shiba Inu is an ancient Japanese dog breed that looks like a canine through and through. However, when you start to dissect the Shiba Inu\u2019s personality traits, it\u2019s easy to see why this breed makes the cut when it comes to catlike dog breeds. \u201cDaring, courageous and extremely pleasant to be around, the Shiba Inu is catlike in more than just his temperament,\u201d says Gina DiNardo, executive secretary of the American Kennel Club. \u201cHe enjoys keeping himself clean and groomed, and you\u2019ll often catch this pup meticulously licking himself like his kitty friends do.\u201d Besides grooming maintenance, Gore adds that the Shiba Inu shares some of a cat\u2019s reserved qualities. \u201cSimilar to feline friends, the Shiba will let you know if they&#039;re interested in participating\u2014or not,\u201d she says. Afghan Hound  Image via iStock.com/Laura Fay Gore says that the regality and the glamour of the Afghan Hound makes the breed line up with glamorous cat breeds, such as Persians and Himalayans. But in addition to its lustrous looks, the Afghan Hound is a very independent dog breed. Sound like any felines you know? \u201cAfghan Hounds are bred to work independently rather than taking cues from people,\u201d says DiNardo. This independent streak, coupled with the breed\u2019s high prey drive, makes this breed very catlike in nature. Italian Greyhound  Image via iStock.com/MarkHatfield A miniature version of the Greyhound, the Italian Greyhound\u2019s small size and ideal grace make them very catlike. The Italian Greyhound also \u201cenjoys sunbathing like kitties and really hates getting wet,\u201d says DiNardo. \u201cAnd, just like cats, the Italian Greyhound loves being up on elevated surfaces.\u201d These hounds are also known for their instinct for pursuit\u2014a trait undeniably shared by both domestic and wild cats alike. Saluki  Image via iStock.com/CaptureLight While the Saluki is much larger and taller than a feline housemate, Gore explains that Salukis have low-key personalities that put them in the category of dogs that act like cats. \u201cDainty and gentle, this wispy breed can be shy, sweet and reserved, containing a catlike quietude and serenity,\u201d she says. DiNardo agrees that the Saluki, a sighthound often used for hunting and racing, is a dog that acts similarly to a cat. \u201cThey are gentle and affectionate toward their families but aloof toward strangers,\u201d she says. Pharaoh Hound  Image via iStock.com/Eudyptula When it comes to hunting skills, cats usually have dogs beat. They stalk and track prey with great efficiency. But, certain dog breeds are adept at hunting too, and the Pharaoh Hound is one dog breed that can give felines a run for their money. \u201cPharaoh Hounds are known for their exceptional hunting skills magnified by their incomparable scenting power, speed and stamina,\u201d says DiNardo. \u201cThey have been bred to become reliable sighthounds and rabbit hunters.\u201d Whippet  Image via iStock.com/BiancaGrueneberg If you know anything about cats, you understand that they tend to have the midnight crazies where they play and hunt at ungodly hours while their humans are trying to sleep. Whippets, says DiNardo, are not dissimilar. \u201cWhippets and cats share a strong prey drive,\u201d she explains. \u201cThey both go nuts hunting down smaller animals. Finally, when their exercise needs are met, Whippets tend to be lazy around the house. Like cats, they love to lounge in warm spaces.\u201d Papillon  Image via iStock.com/Bigandt_Photography These family-friendly dogs make great companion animals, especially for families with children. The Papillon dog breed is smart, cunning and competes with cats when it comes to wits. \u201cPapillons are extremely friendly with children and adults alike. However, this breed needs training to be socialized in a proper way,\u201d says DiNardo. \u201cThese canines are as intelligent as cats. In addition, this dog breed is highly self-assured and confident as well.\u201d Shar-Pei  Image via iStock.com/bruev The Shar-Pei is an extremely strong, muscular dog, so they might not be the first breed to come to mind when you think about catlike dogs. \u201cShar-Peis are strong, regal, independent guardians famous for intelligence and loyalty,\u201d says DiNardo. \u201cThey are suspicious of strangers and other dogs.\u201d Gore agrees that the Shar-Pei is aloof, but when they warm up to you, their true, noticeably catlike personalities come through.
