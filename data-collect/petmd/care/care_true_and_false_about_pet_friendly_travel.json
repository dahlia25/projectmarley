Here are some that may affect your next vacation.", "articleBody": "By Carol Bryant True or False:\u00a0Dogs are never allowed to dine with their owners when eating out. False. There are indeed many restaurants that now allow Fido to dine alongside their owners, as ordinances in each city/state/province deem where dogs are and are not allowed. In most cases, dogs can dine al fresco alongside their pet parents on the patio. There are many myths and misconceptions when it comes to traveling with dogs;\u00a0everything from \u201call hotels charge super high pet-friendly fees\u201d (false), to \u201cI could never get my dog used to a car\u201d (not always true). Here, we dispel some falses and dish the reality on some truths pertaining to pet-friendly travel. True or False:\u00a0Dogs cannot get sunburned while traveling in a car, since the exterior protects them. False. The sun\u2019s ultraviolet rays can beam through car windows and cause sunburn on both human and pet skin. Fur is a great protector, but the sun\u2019s harmful UV light can burn right through fur. Apply a dog-friendly sunscreen and/or use in-car window shades when traveling. True or False:\u00a0Airlines will allow dogs to fly as cargo any time of year. False. Policies differ according to airlines, and depending on the temperature and climate, they may ban the flying of pets certain times of the year. True or False:\u00a0Hotel pet fees are applicable one time for one pet. False. Always ask what pet fees are when making reservations and indicate that you are bringing a dog.\u00a0 Fees may apply per pet and there may be a weight limit imposed. For example, \u201cDogs 50 pounds and under are welcome to stay for a one-time nonrefundable $25 fee.\u201d Just because the Internet site says pets are welcome does not make it so. Websites may not be updated, so save yourself disappointment on check in: Call first and ask/confirm pet policies and pet acceptance. True or False:\u00a0Dogs should have pit stops to relieve themselves when traveling. True. Though it seems common sense, a quiet restrained dog in the backseat still has potty break needs. Keep Fido\u2019s bladder empty and allow him or her to stretch their paws every hour or two. True or False:\u00a0A dog that is fearful of travel can be changed so he or she loves it. True/False: Sometimes, yes and sometimes, no. Never force or make a travel fearful dog to \u201cface their fears.\u201d This will only reinforce anxiety, can lead to extreme nervousness, panic, and even cause an accident.\u00a0If the only time a dog experiences the car is to see the vet or groomer, then Rover is most likely to despise the car. Be patient, take your time, and make a dog\u2019s arrival point a grand one: the dog park, a favorite friend or relative\u2019s house, and be sure to reward when arriving at destination. Consult with a veterinarian or animal behaviorist for more tips."}]
