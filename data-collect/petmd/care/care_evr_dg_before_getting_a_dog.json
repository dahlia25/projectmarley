Learn how to choose a dog &amp; what to know beforehand on petMD.", "articleBody": "Have you been dreaming of getting a dog ever since you saw the reruns of the television classic Lassie as a kid? Or maybe you were fortunate enough to watch the original series. While your dog might not be able to save you week after week from a burning building, a runaway freight train, or the bottom of a well (and in the time it takes to finish a 30-minute episode, too), owning a dog can be a wonderful experience. Here are some tips on how to choose the right dog for you and what to do to prepare to bring your new canine friend home. How to Choose a Dog \u00a0 1. Dogs take up a lot of time and energy. Yes, they are rewarding. But if you live alone and work twenty hours a day, then perhaps a dog is not the best choice for you. Hey, there are always those super-cool robot dogs. 2. If you are not often at home, and you really want a dog, you probably should invest in a dog walker. You&#039;d probably be wise to choose a dog breed that isn&#039;t especially needy, too. Check out PetMD&#039;s Breedopedia to select from a wide variety of breeds. 3. Any dog you get should be suitable to not only your lifestyle, but your surroundings. If you live in a shoebox apartment, then a large dog is not a good choice. You don\u2019t want your dog to develop health issues, be bored, or destroy things. Large dogs really belong in big places with lots of outdoor space. 4. Consider which breeds are suitable for your region&#039;s climate, especially if you have a yard and want to keep it as an outside dog. 5. Puppies require the most work when it comes to house training. If you: (a) don\u2019t want your things chewed up, or (b) don\u2019t have the time or money to train the puppy, consider adopting an already housebroken, adult dog. 6. Regardless of the dog breed you choose, have fun! They say there is no better friend than a dog. We have to agree. \u00a0 Things to Consider Before Getting a Dog 1. Make sure you have lots of chew toys available for your puppy and keep all expensive things (like shoes and clothes) out of its reach; the same goes for chemicals and medicines. Puppies like to investigate and try everything, so make sure there is nothing dangerous around for them to sample. 2. Get your dog vaccinated and spayed or neutered as soon as possible. Oh, and take your dog to the vet for its routine checkups. Your dog will thank you for it and live a much better (and longer) life. 3. Get a proper leash and harness for your dog. A leash too small or too large may hurt it inadvertently during its walking routine, or, worse yet, allow it to hurt others or get loose and run away. 4. Health insurance is a must. Consult your veterinarian as to your best options. \u00a0Image: Helga Weber / via Flickr"}]
