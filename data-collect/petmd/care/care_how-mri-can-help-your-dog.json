Although MRIs have been used since the 1970s to diagnose the cause behind everything from headaches to knee pain in humans, it\u2019s only recently that the diagnostic tool has become readily available for animals. \u201cThe technology has evolved very quickly over the past ten years,\u201d says Matthew Barnhart, a veterinary surgeon at MedVet Columbus, an emergency and specialty hospital in Ohio. \u201cI\u2019ve been practicing long enough to remember when they weren\u2019t an option. When we first started doing MRIs, we used to take our patients to a human hospital.\u201d Today, MRIs aren\u2019t just possible for dogs, they\u2019re commonly used. Here\u2019s what you need to know if your veterinarian suggests one, from what conditions they can help diagnose to what potential risks they present. What is an MRI? MRI stands for \u201cmagnetic resonance imaging.\u201d Whereas X-rays and CT scans use ionizing radiation (which is potentially harmful) to take images, MRIs use magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed, high-quality images of the body part being scanned. Although MRIs are occasionally used to diagnose knee, nerve, and other issues in dogs, the vast majority are used to examine problems with the brain and spinal cord, says Philip Cohen, a veterinary neurologist at Mount Laurel Animal Hospital, a New Jersey-based emergency and specialty care facility. \u201cAs a neurologist, the most common diagnostic test that I recommend is an MRI,\u201d says Cohen. \u201cAn MRI is ideal because it\u2019s particularly good for looking at soft tissue structures [like the brain and spinal cord], and it gives more detail than a CT scan.\u201d Problems that an MRI may be able to diagnose include tumors, inflammation, herniated discs and stenosis [narrowing]. If your dog has seizures, is exhibiting an unusual walking pattern, is suffering from back problems or is experiencing paralysis, your veterinarian may recommend an MRI. However, the test is only considered after more traditional diagnostic measures have failed and if the information obtained from an MRI will be valuable for further treatment. For example, if the dog\u2019s current quality of life is too good or too poor to recommend invasive surgery, an MRI may not be recommended. \u201cWe don\u2019t take this test lightly\u2014it\u2019s very involved,\u201d says Barnhart. \u201cTo me, the biggest question is, \u2018What are we going to do with the information that we get?\u2019 If a dog has minor spinal issues, we\u2019re not going to go forward with surgical intervention, so an MRI isn\u2019t valuable to me.\u201d What\u2019s Involved in an MRI? Like humans, dogs are placed in a large, enclosed magnet while undergoing an MRI. However, whereas calming music is played to help humans relax and stay still, dogs need more complicated measures to ensure that the scan is successful. Because MRIs can last over an hour, animals must undergo general anesthesia. The good news is, unlike you, your dog won\u2019t experience the claustrophobia and stress that many humans report with MRIs. The downside, however, is that all anesthesia comes with risks. \u201cThe major downside in veterinary medicine is that we can\u2019t tell our patients, \u2018OK, take a deep breath and stay still,\u2019\u201d says Cohen. \u201cWe can\u2019t explain to Fluffy that these images take a long time to get, and we need him to relax.\u201d Potential Drawbacks of MRIs for Dogs While the likelihood of anything going wrong with anesthesia is rare, it\u2019s still something that must be considered. \u201cThere\u2019s no risk-free anesthesia, but with today\u2019s advances in pharmacology, an adverse event is highly, highly unusual,\u201d says Barnhart. \u201cWe anesthetize dogs and cats every day that are very sick, and they do OK\u2014for a dog that\u2019s generally healthy except for a spine issue, the risk is very low.\u201d Although generally considered safe, the added step of anesthesia contributes to another drawback of MRIs: cost. \u201cThe big downside is that they\u2019re certainly not cheap,\u201d says Cohen, who estimates that an MRI can cost pet owners anywhere from $2,000 to upwards of $3,500, depending on the complexity of the required images. \u201cThis is one of the reasons I always recommend pet insurance.\u201d It\u2019s also important to remember that, no matter how sophisticated the technology, MRIs do not always provide answers. Pet owners need to be prepared for the scan to reveal little new information about their dog\u2019s condition. \u201cA MRI is a great diagnostic tool, but there\u2019s nothing perfect out there,\u201d says Cohen. \u201cTechnology has come a long way, but I still run into cases where I\u2019m really confident I\u2019ll find something on an MRI and there\u2019s nothing on there. We can run all the tests in the world and sometimes find no answer.\u201d Before scheduling an MRI, be sure to speak with your veterinarian about all of your concerns and work together to create a plan that will make you and your dog confident and comfortable."}]
