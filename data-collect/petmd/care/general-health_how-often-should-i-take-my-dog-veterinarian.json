Dr. Nicole Savageau, a veterinarian at\u00a0The Vets, adds that if your pet may be sick or injured, it\u2019s always best to err on the side of caution by contacting your vet, even if it means an emergency visit.\u00a0 There\u2019s no denying that vet appointments are a fact of life for pet parents, but you might wonder how often your pup should go. Turns out, the answer isn&#039;t one-size-fits-all. How often your dog sees their vet depends on their age, lifestyle, and whether they have any underlying health conditions. How Often Should I Take My Puppy to the Veterinarian? Expect to take your puppy to the vet four times or more during their first year alone. In other words, you&#039;ll have plenty of time to get to know your chosen vet. \u201cThese early visits are significant,\u201d Savageau says, \u201cnot only for disease prevention but also for guidance on training, socialization, and nutrition, which all set a strong foundation for your puppy&#039;s lifelong health and well-being.\u201d The number of puppy vet visits may vary slightly, depending on what vaccines your pup needs and whether you\u2019ll spay or neuter your puppy. You can count on your veterinarian to lay out exactly what your puppy requires, but you can refer to the general guidelines below to prepare. \u00a0Puppy Life from 6\u201316 weeks Your puppy\u2019s first vet appointment will be when they\u2019re about 8 weeks old, Savageau says. This important first visit will include vaccinations, deworming, and a thorough examination to ensure your puppy is healthy. Puppies are born with antibodies from their mom, but these antibodies start to taper off around this stage. \u201cTimely vaccinations help bridge this immunity gap, ensuring that the puppy can safely explore the world, socialize with other dogs, and grow up healthy and resilient,\u201d Savageau explains. Following your veterinarian&#039;s recommended vaccination schedule provides your puppy with the best possible start in life. How often your dog sees their vet depends on their age, lifestyle, and whether they have any underlying health conditions.You can expect your vet to recommend core vaccines against\u00a0parvovirus, distemper, adenovirus, and parainfluenza. However, they may recommend additional vaccines, such as\u00a0Bordetella (kennel cough), leptospirosis, influenza (flu vaccines), or\u00a0Lyme vaccines, depending on where you live, your dog\u2019s lifestyle, and family history. About four weeks later and then again around the 16-week mark, your puppy will get the second (and possibly a third) round of those vaccines. It\u2019s also when they\u2019ll receive their\u00a0rabies vaccine, which is typically required by law. Puppy Life at 6 Months If you\u2019re considering getting your puppy\u00a0spayed or neutered\u2014Savageau recommends it for non-breeding dogs\u2014the six-month mark is when puppies are typically old enough for the surgery. \u201cSpaying (for females) and neutering (for males) can help prevent unwanted litters,\u00a0reduce the risk of certain health issues, and potentially curb behavioral problems related to mating instinct,\u201d she explains. If your puppy hasn\u2019t already completed their last set of vaccines, that will happen by the time they\u2019re 6 months old, too. Of course, those won\u2019t be your puppy\u2019s last vaccinations since they\u2019ll require boosters. For example, they\u2019ll require a rabies booster around a year old and then every three years after that (or annually depending on where you live). How Often Should I Take My Adult Dog to the Veterinarian? Adult dogs should see their vet once a year\u2014even when they appear healthy. \u201cDuring your dog\u2019s annual exams, your veterinarian will conduct a thorough physical examination to check for any signs of illness, dental problems, or changes in weight and behavior,\u201d Savageau explains. This helps catch any illnesses early. During your dog&#039;s\u00a0annual wellness exam, your veterinarian will recommend any necessary vaccine boosters and do their annual heartworm check with a blood test. Your vet can also provide advice on preventive flea, tick, and heartworm medications. This is also a good time to\u00a0ask any questions you have about your dog&#039;s care, such as diet and exercise. If your dog has any underlying or chronic conditions, they\u2019ll likely need to visit their vet more often. How Often Should I Take My Senior Dog to the Veterinarian? Dogs are typically considered senior at 7 years old, with giant pups given senior status earlier than smaller breeds. As pets age, their risk of age-related diseases increases, so most vets recommend that senior dogs see their vet every six months, rather than annually. Senior wellness exams are similar to adult dog exams, but with more blood tests to check for key markers like kidney and liver function, blood sugar levels, and thyroid function, Savageau explains. These senior blood panels help to detect and manage health concerns early, helping your pup\u00a0make the most of their golden years. Hopefully, all the vet visits throughout your dog&#039;s life will make these visits as stress-free as possible. However, if your pup finds travel stressful or has limited mobility, consider vets like Savageau who will\u00a0visit your dog at home.\u00a0\u00a0 When Does My Dog Need an Emergency Vet Visit? If your dog seems unwell, contact your vet. According to Savageau, the following are always emergencies: Severe injuries Breathing difficulties Bloated abdomen Ingestion of toxic substances Excessive vomiting or diarrhea Seizures Sudden lethargy Uncontrolled bleeding Do I Need Pet Insurance for My Dog? Similar to human health insurance, pet insurance can help cover your dog\u2019s routine checkups and emergency treatments, depending on the policy you choose and its monthly premium. Chances are, if you purchase pet insurance for your puppy, your monthly premium will\u00a0save you money in the long run. However, pet insurance doesn\u2019t fit everyone\u2019s needs, and your dog\u2019s age, breed, or\u00a0pre-existing conditions can make a significant difference in cost and coverage. If that\u2019s the case, Savageau says\u00a0pet wellness plans are another smart option. Wellness plans cover routine care, such as wellness exams and vaccinations, rather than accidents, injuries, or disease management.\u00a0 How Much Does a Vet Visit Cost? Without insurance, vet appointments can range between $50 to $100 for the physical exam and more depending on what the exam includes and where you live. If your dog needs to see an emergency vet outside of regular business hours, it could cost you double that. Additional costs at each visit will depend on your dog\u2019s age and needs. For example, if your puppy is due for a round of core vaccines (rabies and distemper), you could be paying more on top of the exam fee. Other extra fees include blood work, urine and fecal testing, special diets prescribed by your vet, or flea and tick control, but you can also shop prices and fill those prescriptions through\u00a0Chewy&#039;s online pharmacy.
