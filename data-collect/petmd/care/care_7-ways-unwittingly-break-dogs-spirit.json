We know beyond a reasonable doubt that dogs can feel sorrow and get depressed, and the very essence of who they are as a species is threatened by a very common predator: mankind. Here are seven things that are guaranteed to destroy your dog&#039;s spirit. Read on to see how many you hear about, read about, see or engage in daily, and why you should never do them. Scolding / Yelling / Rubbing a Dog\u2019s Nose in Waste for Relieving Himself in the House It is a myth that dogs know that we are mad at them when we yell because they\u2019ve peed or pooped in the house. Finding a puddle of piddle in the house may not be pleasant for humans, but dogs do not feel guilt when humans show their disapproval. Instead, they are reacting fearfully to the emotional response of their owner, regardless of when the accident occurred. Screaming or yelling reinforces bullying, and because it usually happens long after the accident, the dog is left confused and afraid of you. They still won\u2019t make the connection if it happens just after. Never, ever rub a dog\u2019s nose in poo or pee, as this is not only disgusting, but it comes from\u00a0an old-school mentality that is just plain mean. Hitting a Dog Long gone are the days of dominance dog training\u00a0and animal submission. Hitting is a very outdated dog training method. All hitting does is teach the dog that you are to be feared. If you need something to hit, take it out on a punching bag at the gym and look into anger management counseling. Do not, however, bring a dog into your life. He or she does not deserve this treatment.\u00a0 Punishing a Dog With &quot;Time Out&quot; in a Kennel If a puppy is not cooperating or not doing the desired behavior during training, it isn\u2019t that he is being \u201cspiteful\u201d or defiant; he is just being a puppy. It is\u00a0your\u00a0behavior that needs to be modified. Consider the task at hand and reconsider your dog training methods. Also, it could be that the puppy is distracted, or isn\u2019t developmentally ready for that task. The same holds true for adult dogs. If an adult dog does something you are not pleased about, never punish or banish him to a kennel. Taking a Dog\u2019s Food or Treats Away While Eating Not only is it ridiculous to take away\u00a0dog food\u00a0or\u00a0treats, especially when they are eating, but it serves nothing more than to assert what a grand bully you are. \u00a0It\u2019s helpful to teach your dog instead that people being near his\u00a0dog bowl\u00a0signals that something good is about to happen, like getting extra-special treats, rather than an attempt to take his resource away. While your dog is eating, toss goodies like freeze-dried\u00a0dog food toppings\u00a0in his bowl so your dog starts to welcome your approach. If you\u2019re concerned by the intensity of your dog\u2019s reaction when you get too close to his food bowl or bone, reach out to a force-free trainer for help addressing your dog\u2019s resource-guarding behavior. Not Walking Your Dog or Engaging in Quality Time If you want something that lives, yet requires no attention other than to give it water and occasional sunlight, get a houseplant, not a pet. Dogs thrive on companionship, and without mental and physical stimulation, they slowly wither away. Have you ever seen a dog in a shelter who gets little to no interaction, and how sad and destroyed his spirit becomes? Do not let this happen to your dog. We are all busy, but our pets rely on us. Walk away from the electronic devices and walk with your dog instead. No matter a dog&#039;s age, they need to interact with you. Leaving a Dog Alone for Inordinate Amounts of Time Again, if you want something that can spend most of the day alone, this is the time for a houseplant, not a pet. Dogs need companionship\u2014not just for the emotional connection and to truly thrive, but for their physical well-being, too. Would you like to hold your pee in for 10 to 12 hours a day? In fact, some dogs will do this just to not upset their owner. Other dogs will pee inside because they can\u2019t hold it (and shouldn\u2019t have to), and then the owner gets mad upon return. Seek the services of a family member, friend, neighbor, pet sitter or doggy day care if you must leave your dog for long hours at a time. Nothing destroys a dog\u2019s spirit like emptiness, so don\u2019t do it. Allowing a Dog to Suffer If an animal is hurt or injured, please seek veterinary care. Allowing an animal to suffer in pain (and dogs are known to hide their symptoms) serves no one. Yes, veterinary care can be expensive, and yes, sometimes we as pet parents don\u2019t want to hear that our dogs are aging and showing signs of it. \u00a0But we owe it to our dogs to give back the unconditional love and dedication they provide to us. Though these are not pleasant reminders to read, they are all too true. Best advice ever: Do none of these, and if a dog you know is being harmed, speak up, do something and/or tell someone. A dog\u2019s life just might depend on it."}]
