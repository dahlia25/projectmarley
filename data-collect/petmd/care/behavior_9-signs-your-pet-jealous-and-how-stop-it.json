Here are some jealous behaviors to look out for and tips for helping jealous pets.", "articleBody": "By Nicole Pajer When you go to pet another animal, your pup may jump in between and push your hand away from the other dog. Or your cat may meow excessively because you\u2019re not paying attention to them. But are these actually jealous behaviors? Suzanne Hetts, applied animal behaviorist and co-owner of Animal Behavior Associates in Littleton, Colorado, says the jury is out on whether a cat or dog feels the same type of jealous feelings that humans do. \u201cIn most cases, this is better described as a competitive situation where the pet is competing with another individual\u2014human, dog, cat, or otherwise\u2014for something it wants,\u201d says Hetts.\u00a0 Regardless of what you call it, jealous behavior in pets can be an issue. 9 Signs of Jealousy in Pets Here are some jealous behaviors in pets that you should be on the lookout for: 1. Aggression\u00a0 \u201cThis can often be in the form of biting or nibbling of the animal or person getting attention over them,\u201d says Dr. Scarlett Magda, founding president of New York City-based Veterinarians International. 2. Going to the bathroom indoors/outside the litter box\u00a0 \u201cOur pets can\u2019t express their thoughts and feelings in words, so instead, they sometimes express their feelings in actions,\u201d says Dr. Geoffrey Broderick, a veterinarian in Huntington, New York. \u201cIf you see them peeing or pooping in places where they shouldn\u2019t, they may be trying to tell you something.\u201d However, having accidents in the house or going outside the litter box can be a sign of a health issue, so your first stop should be a vet visit to make sure your pet does not need medical attention. 3. Paying extra attention to you (being \u201cclingy\u201d)\u00a0 According to Dr. Broderick, clingy behavior from a dog or cat can come across as a pet cuddling up extra-close to you and suddenly licking your hand or face. \u201cThis is a sign of affection, and they are trying to get your attention,\u201d he says. 4. Pushy behavior\u00a0 Dr. Magda notes that this often comes in the form of a pet \u201cinhibiting another person or animal from moving freely on a regular basis, or pushing their way into a situation, demanding the attention of their owner.\u201d 5. Growling, hissing, or getting into a fight with another pet\u00a0 This may especially be an issue in a multi-pet household where pets are competing for attention and resources, Dr. Broderick points out. 6. Trying to scare off strangers\u00a0 \u201cPets may aggressively bark, hiss, or growl when owners are greeted or visitors arrive,\u201d Dr. Magda says. 7. Doing a trick\u00a0 According to Dr. Broderick, this is a surefire sign that your pet is trying to get your attention. 8. Crowding your space\u00a0 \u201cCats sometimes will lie down on your work table or sit on your computer keyboard to get attention, or even start knocking things off the table,\u201d Dr. Broderick says. \u201cA dog may sit up and beg to try and get your attention, or sit up on their hind legs.\u201d 9. Leaving the room\u00a0 Sometimes when pets get mad, they may have a tendency to withdraw, Dr. Broderick says. What Causes Jealous Behaviors in Pets? According to experts, jealous-like behaviors in pets typically suggest boredom or a ploy for attention from their owners. \u201cSometimes, just like people, they can feel insecure,\u201d Dr. Broderick explains. \u201cThey need individual attention, lots of cuddling, and activities to keep them busy and to keep them from being bored. Sometimes, our pets just want us, and they don\u2019t want to share us with another pet or person.\u201d A lack of resources (only one toy for multiple pets), social conflict, too small of a space, stress, lack of exercise, and genetic disposition can cause jealous behavior, says Katenna Jones, associate applied animal behaviorist and owner of Jones Animal Behavior in Warwick, Rhode Island. How to Stop Jealous Behavior in Pets Here are some of Dr. Magda\u2019s tips for reducing jealousy in a multi-pet household: Keep notes on the circumstances that cause signs of jealousy/aggression. This can be helpful when you see behaviors that you can\u2019t manage on your own, as you can share the list with your vet or a professional animal behaviorist. Don\u2019t give one pet more attention than another. Help your dog feel safe and relaxed in their crate so they see it as their own safe space. Give cats a space to call their own as well. Feed pets separately to avoid conflict during mealtimes. Give your pets the same amount of treats. When you arrive home, make sure you don\u2019t give one pet more attention than the other, or wait a bit to give attention. The level of emotional excitement will diminish, preventing signs of aggression from occurring. Put a\u00a0leash\u00a0on both dogs when walking two at a time and consider a gentle leader for better control. Don\u2019t pet one animal without petting the other. Have at least two of all toys and beds, but remove food-based toys unless supervised. Catch your pets being good. Give them attention and praise when they are acting calm and not showing jealous behaviors. Managing unwanted behaviors and keeping pets mentally healthy are keys to avoiding unpleasant situations down the line, Dr. Broderick says. \u201cAs pet parents, we need to attend to their physical and emotional needs, just like we do for our human children,\u201d he says. \u201cOur pets just want to feel loved.\u201d Featured Image: iStock.com/chendongshan"}]
