Here are some of the most common offenders: Chocolate: Most people are aware that chocolate is bad for cats and dogs. In toxic doses, it can cause agitation, diarrhea, pacing, seizures, or even death. It is dose-dependent, meaning milk chocolate with lower cocoa percentages is less toxic than dark or baking chocolate. Raisins, grapes, and currants: For reasons still undetermined, these little fruits can lead to kidney damage. Onions and garlic: In toxic amounts, can lead to blood cell damage and subsequent anemia. Macadamia nuts: Cause neurologic signs such as wobbliness, weakness, and tremors. Bread dough: In addition to the mechanical damage of an expanding mass of dough in the stomach, fermentation produces alcohol, which can lead to intoxication. Mushrooms: As in people, while some varieties are fine, others are extremely toxic. Never let your pet free graze on mushrooms he finds outside. Xylitol: A very common artificial sweetener found in everything from peanut butter to gum, small amounts of xylitol can cause life threatening hypoglycemia in pets. It\u2019s so toxic that I tell people don\u2019t even try to keep it out of your pet\u2019s reach: keep it out of the house, entirely."}]
