Dr. Jean Hofve shares some tips on getting your pet on the natural path.", "articleBody": "Natural Remedies for Dogs and Cats By Cheryl Lock If you&#039;re interested in helping your pet lead a healthier life, going the natural route is a big step in the right direction. We spoke with Jean Hofve, DVM, staff veterinarian for Only Natural Pet, for some expert tips on how to get started down the all natural path. 1. Natural Pet Food Food is the biggest investment you make in your pet\u2019s health \u2013 so make it count! Unfortunately, some pet food companies have caught on to consumers\u2019 desires for wholesome, natural food for their pets, so they have created friendly-looking packaging, brand advertising, and new claims on their products\u2014but in some cases, without improving the ingredients inside, says\u00a0Dr. Hofve. Here are a few of the vet&#039;s general guidelines to help you choose the best natural pet food: Unless a corn ingredient is labeled organic, it\u2019s going to be genetically modified.\u00a0At least two named meats or meat meals should be among the top ingredients in a dry food, and a named meat should be the first ingredient in any other form (canned, raw, dehydrated, frozen).Avoid synthetic chemical preservatives like ethyoxyquin, BHT, BHA, propyl gallate and propylene glycol.Choose a food that is complete and balanced for all life stages rather than tweaked for a certain lifestage. Foods with more of an emphasis on natural, are ususally all life stage.\u00a0For cats in particular, a high-protein, high-moisture diet is crucial to maintain a lifetime of optimal kidney and bladder health, as well as to prevent obesity and the diseases that go with it, like diabetes, heart disease and arthritis. Try canned, homemade or raw for cats. (But always make a slow and gradual transition to minimize tummy problems.)Often, it\u2019s the specialty manufacturers who are doing the best job of finding good quality ingredients and making a healthy natural food for a reasonable price. Choose brands that have put their efforts into making the best food possible.Dry and canned pet food are heavily processed. Consider raw, frozen or dehydrated diets to get the most natural nutrition.2. Pet Grooming There is little or no regulation of pet grooming products, says Dr. Hofve, so companies can use perfumes, detergents and other potentially harmful chemicals. This is especially true of shampoos intended to kill fleas or solve skin problems like flaking or itching. The skin can absorb many of these chemicals, so they get into the blood and put a strain on the liver, which has to break them down, store them or eliminate them. Natural pet grooming products that use mild ingredients \u2014 including safe herbs \u2014 are gentler on the skin and less likely to be absorbed and accumulated in the body. 3. Supplements and Vitamins Dr. Hofve warns that there is a big difference between natural and synthetic vitamins. Natural vitamins derived from whole foods are much better absorbed and utilized by the body. Vitamins made in a laboratory are less efficient and may even be harmful. Many human studies have found unexpected adverse effects from large doses of synthetic vitamins.  4. Flea and Tick Control According to the Environmental Protection Agency, every single registered chemical flea and tick product has been documented to have caused adverse reactions for some pets, says Dr. Hofve. Fortunately, there are natural flea and tick control methods available for our pets, though it does takes vigilance and dedication to make them work. A three-pronged approach will only be successful if applied correctly to the pet, the house/car, and the yard. A truly healthy pet will be much less susceptible to parasites, so getting the diet in order is paramount. Certain supplements, such as B vitamins, garlic and yeast are reportedly aversive to flea and tick taste buds. Flea tags are also helpful. Use a flea comb frequently to make sure you\u2019re staying ahead of the game. Frequent bathing with a natural flea-repellent shampoo may be needed in heavy infestations. Diatomaceous earth, borax and beneficial nematodes (worms) can be used in the yard, and frequent vacuuming in the house and car will scoop up flea eggs before they can hatch. Keeping a tidy yard and misting your pet with a safe herbal repellent before outdoor excursions will also keep bugs away. 5. Pet Treats and Chews There are many great treats out there, says Dr. Hofve, but even more bad ones. Jerky treats (chicken, duck, sweet potato and dried fruit treats) made in China are implicated in illness and death in many hundreds of dogs and cats. While some of the worst offenders were recalled, they are already coming back onto shelves \u2014 yet are still made in China. Freeze-dried or dehydrated meats and organs (such as liver or lung) are your best bet. Make sure they contain no additives or chemicals and have not undergone harsh processing. Simple is how nature made them, and that\u2019s how they should stay! 6. Cat Litter Litter is tricky. The most common type of litter is made from clay, says Dr. Hofve. Clay is extracted from the ground in an environmentally unfriendly mining process,and it creates a lot of dust (even in the \u201cdustless\u201d types). Since your cat\u2019s nose is just a few inches away from her digging paws, clay dust can get down into her lungs, where it can cause inflammation, and even asthma in susceptible cats. There is also a risk (though very small) of intestinal impaction of clay in the digestive tract of very young kittens, very elderly cats or cats with extremely furry paws; they are more likely to walk through wet litter, and ingest it when they lick their paws clean. It\u2019s preferable to use natural, sustainable resources, such as corn, walnut hulls, wheat or sawdust. However, they too have benefits and drawbacks. Some are quite dusty themselves, and many have scents (whether artificial fragrance or natural pine oils) that are aversive and even potentially toxic to sensitive kitties. Pine oils in particular can cause an allergic reaction. Newsprint is sort of renewable, but the inks used on newspaper may be toxic. Most cats prefer the softer surface of fine-textured clumping litters over pellets, pearls and large clay pieces. But the most important thing is to use a litter that the cat likes, and is also easy to keep clean so you\u2019ll do it! A dirty box is the No. 1 reason for failure of the cat to use it.
