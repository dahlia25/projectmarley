But many vets also suffer from stress and depression, and suicide rates among veterinarians is high. So, here are reasons you should regularly show thanks to your vet, and a couple tips for how to do it.", "articleBody": "By Teresa Traverse As a pet owner, you rely on your vet to take care of your pet. But many vets are struggling to take care of themselves. The suicide rate among veterinarians is high: More than one in six veterinarians might have contemplated suicide since graduation, according to a study released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study also showed that vets are more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders like depression than the general population. It\u2019s a problem that the veterinary community is sadly aware of. \u201cWe have all lost at least one colleague to suicide,\u201d says Heather Loenser, DVM, the veterinary advisor of professional and public affairs for the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA). But if this is news to you, that\u2019s not really much of a surprise to Ron Del Moro, Ph.D., a licensed clinical counselor at University of Florida&#039;s Veterinary Hospitals. \u201cEveryone\u2019s aware of it, but no one really talks about,\u201d says Del Moro. Well, we\u2019re here to talk about it. Here are some of the issues that veterinarians routinely face and ways you can show appreciation to your vet all year round. 1. Many Vets are Perfectionists \u201cI don\u2019t know any non-perfectionist veterinarians. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re out there. I just don\u2019t know them,\u201d says Loenser. Veterinary medicine is competitive. With only 30 schools of veterinary medicine in the United States, getting admitted is tough. And those intelligent, competitive traits that get vets into school stick with them after graduation.\u00a0 \u201cYou have these really highly intelligent people, driven people who are perfectionists who want to solve problems and heal everybody. It\u2019s a tough job,\u201d says Del Moro. \u201cSo many times our minds are the biggest problems that get in the way.\u201d Facing the reality that financial and other concerns often prevent them from saving pets who could be saved is terribly difficult for many veterinarians. 2. Vets are Human, Too As pet owners, it can be tough not to see your vet as some sort of superhero. After all, he or she cures diseases and heals your pets when they\u2019re sick. But it\u2019s important to remember that vets are people too. And like any human, vets make mistakes and have setbacks. \u00a0 \u201cFailure\u2019s not necessarily something we were trained to be comfortable with,\u201d says Loenser. \u201cWhen things go wrong in a case\u2014there\u2019s an outcome that we weren\u2019t anticipating or we were hoping didn\u2019t happen, but it does. That\u2019s really hard on us all the way down to the core of our beings.\u201d 3. They Handle Euthanasia Procedures Having to end a pet\u2019s life can be a heartbreaking task\u2014but veterinarians do it on a regular basis. And some handle the task better than others, Loenser says. \u201cSome people look at that as a viable alternative to having an animal suffer with a chronic disease. In that case, you\u2019re truly alleviating suffering,\u201d she says. \u201cOther veterinarians don\u2019t look at it that way. They take it very personally when an animal has to be put to sleep.\u201d 4. They Deal With Small Business Stress Many vets run their own businesses and have to deal with all the stresses that go along with that, including managing staff, paying a lease, and dealing with taxes. \u201cVeterinary schools are getting better at teaching basic business administration in schools. And then there are veterinarians that get MBAs,\u201d says Loenser. \u201cBut that\u2019s not still not the norm, and there\u2019s still room for veterinary schools to better teach us how to run our businesses.\u201d 5. Vets Interact With Unreasonable Clients Both Loenser and Del Moro confirmed that one of the most stressful parts of any vet\u2019s life is interacting with unreasonable pet owners. \u201cYou\u2019ve got these doctors who are doing the best they can with the information they have and sometimes you can\u2019t satisfy the clients enough, ever,\u201d says Del Moro. He acknowledges that the bonds pet owners have with their animals are strong, which can make interactions between vets and their clients emotionally charged. \u201cFirst and foremost, try to empathize with the doctor\u2019s situation and how difficult it is. Whatever news you\u2019re getting,\u201d says Del Moro. \u201cPeople forget that [vets] have feelings too. They too are impacted. They too got into this profession because they love animals. And no one wants to see the animal suffer.\u201d 6. Vets Have High Student Loan Debt Many vets have high student loan debts. The average veterinarian graduates from school owing $153,191 in student loans, according to a study conducted by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA). It can take vets a long time to dig themselves out of this debt. 7. Vets are Paid Relatively Low Salaries In addition to a mountain of veterinary school debt, vets often have to deal with relatively low starting salaries. The average starting salary for a small animal veterinary practitioner is roughly $70,000 according to the AVMA https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/Statistics/Pages/Market-research-statistics-First-year-employment.aspx. While that might not sound like a bad starting salary, it can be tough to pay off debt and achieve other goals like buying a home at that level. \u201cEven though veterinarians don\u2019t go into this for the money, for my peers it\u2019s frustrating when we see other professionals who have gone to school for a similar length that have a lot more stuff and freedom,\u201d says Loenser. Ways You Can Help Veterinarians do a lot for you and your pet, so it\u2019s important to show your vet how much you value his or her work. Here are a few easy\u2014but impactful\u2014ways you can show your vet you care. Give Thanks Don\u2019t think you have to go all out to show appreciation. Saying \u201cthanks\u201d will do. \u201cThanking face to face is always lovely,\u201d says Loenser. \u201cSome people might think we don\u2019t need that, but that\u2019s nice to hear.\u201d Cards, food, and flowers also make nice gifts. Donate to a Charity in Your Vet\u2019s Name Many veterinary hospitals support charities or have memorial funds for animals and staff members who have passed, Loenser tell us. Research those organization and consider donating money to them in your vet\u2019s name. Many vet schools also have funds set up to help animals in need. A client of Loenser\u2019s did this once. \u201cThey gave a donation to my vet school in my name for taking care of their animal. That was huge to me,\u201d says Loenser. Be Straightforward About Finances \u201cWe really try to give accurate estimates. Feel free to go over them with us,\u201d says Loenser. \u201cWhen it comes to the point when you\u2019re checking out of the hospital [make sure] you\u2019re not surprised and then angry.\u201d Veterinarians are willing to talk about the pros and cons of treatment options at different price points, but they don\u2019t know what your constraints are unless you bring them up. Pay Your Bills on Time Many veterinary practices are small business and can struggle to pay their expenses (including the salaries of all those wonderful technicians who have helped your pet) if you don\u2019t pay on time. If you\u2019re on a payment plan, making on-time payments can go a long way in fostering goodwill with your veterinarian. Post a Positive Review on Social Media \u00a0 If you think your vet is giving stellar service, say so on Yelp, Google, or Facebook. \u201cPosting a great review really means the world to us,\u201d says Loenser. \u201cWe love to see positive reviews.\u201d And pointing other pet owners towards a great vet is a win-win for everyone. Be Open To Suggestions Loenser explains that really motivated pet owners will usually research a condition prior to coming in for a visit. But what you\u2019ve read is not always the best solution and can lead to problems if pet parents aren\u2019t open minded and responsive to a veterinarian\u2019s advice. She says she enjoys talking to pet owners who have done their research as it can save her time. But if you\u2019ve been treating a condition with a treatment you found on the Internet and aren\u2019t having success with it, be prepared to listen to what your vet has to say. Follow Recommendations When a vet gives you a treatment plan, follow it. \u201cWe feel heard. We\u2019re saying this because we care about your animals. We believe in what we\u2019re recommending,\u201d says Loenser. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable following the plan or can\u2019t afford it, let your vet know so he or she can recommend a different treatment plan that meets your needs. Arrive on Time \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take much for us to get behind if people start coming in late,\u201d says Loenser. Even if you get there on time, keep in mind that other patients might not have been as punctual. Realize that the vet may have just seen a pet that required more of his or her time. Critically ill pets take precedence over animals with broken toenails or other minor conditions. Respecting your veterinarian\u2019s time and schedule and being understanding if he or she gets pulled away to deal with an emergency will go a long way in demonstrating your gratitude."}]
