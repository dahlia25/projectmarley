Nutrition, and bone health as a result, has improved quite dramatically.\u201d \u00a0 Duerr acknowledges there are many types of dogs for which bone health should still be a concern and focus for owners. This includes growing dogs and large breeds that are more prone to developmental bone disorders and osteoarthritis, both of which can be debilitating for any dog. \u00a0 Here are five ways you can strengthen your dog\u2019s bones. \u00a0 Meeting your dog\u2019s nutritional needs\u2014especially as it pertains to calcium, vitamin D, and phosphorus\u2014is the very best thing you can do for her bone health. The easiest way to do that is to find a nutritionally balanced dog food that\u2019s designed to meet your pet\u2019s specific needs. \u00a0 \u201cCommercial products are formulated to provide sufficient amounts and adequate ratios of calcium and phosphorous for adult dogs and cats, as well as animals during growth,\u201d says Dr. Jonathan Stockman, diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Nutrition and clinical instructor and head of the Clinical Nutrition Service at Colorado State. \u00a0 These standards come from the American Association of Feed Control Officials, and foods that meet them will carry an \u201cAAFCO\u201d statement on their label that reads something along the lines of, \u201cAnimal feeding tests using AAFCO procedures substantiate that Brand A adult dog food provides complete and balanced nutrition for maintenance of adult dogs).\u00a0 \u00a0 Some owners like to prepare their pet\u2019s meals themselves, and while that\u2019s fine under the right circumstances, it\u2019s also really hard. It\u2019s time-consuming. It can be expensive. And achieving appropriate nutritional balance is a major challenge on your own, Stockman says. \u00a0 \u201cAbout 95 percent, according to some estimates, of home-cooked-diet recipes not formulated by a veterinary nutritionist or an individual with advanced training in veterinary nutrition, such as a Ph.D. in dog and cat nutrition, have been found to be unbalanced and do not provide adequate nutrition for long-term,\u201d he says. \u00a0 The biggest and most common problem related to bone health involves vitamin D. It\u2019s necessary for regulating calcium, but Stockman says excess vitamin D can lead to neurological problems, kidney disease, and even death. And the window between the recommended minimum and the safe upper limit is very small. For that reason alone, consultation with a veterinary nutritionist before committing to home-cooking your dog\u2019s food is a good idea. \u00a0 Dogs who overeat are more likely to have joint problems, Duerr says. \u201cThis is especially true during development when overeating causes lasting joint problems because the dogs grow too fast,\u201d he adds. \u00a0 However, erring too much on the side of caution can create other problems. If dogs don\u2019t eat enough, they\u2019ll fall short of their needed daily amounts of bone-building vitamins and minerals. \u00a0 Duerr says supplementation might be necessary in these dogs, but then you also run the risk of over-supplementation, which can be dangerous (more on this later). Therefore, it\u2019s always best to follow portion size recommendations as closely as possible and to monitor your dog\u2019s body condition to fine tune the amount you are offering. \u00a0 There\u2019s no clear science behind the specific type, amount, and intensity of exercise that will strengthen a dog\u2019s bones, Duerr says, but that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t rules worth following. \u201cWe don\u2019t send 8-year-old kids on a marathon,\u201d he explains, \u201cso why would we ask puppies to do the equivalent?\u201d \u00a0 Pushing dogs too much is the easiest way to create bone or joint problems that last a lifetime, but it\u2019s just as bad to do nothing or be extremely inconsistent when it comes to your dog\u2019s exercise. \u00a0 \u201cRegular walks and an occasional run around the yard are usually enough to contribute positively to bone health,\u201d Duerr says. \u201cMultiple times a day for shorter periods is better than one long walk a day, but even that is better than nothing.\u201d \u00a0 A lot of dog owners think adding some bone-building supplements to a dog\u2019s diet helps, but the opposite might be true. \u00a0 \u201cWhen a dog or a cat is provided with a complete and balanced diet with sufficient amounts of vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorous, there is no need for additional supplementation,\u201d Stockman says. And as outlined earlier, too many nutrients can cause various medical problems, some very serious. Too much can be just as dangerous as too little. \u00a0 For animals who are already suffering from bone and joint problems, Stockman says, omega-3 fatty acid supplements may be helpful. \u00a0 \u201cWhen choosing an omega-3 product, it is important to ensure it provides EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) in sufficient concentrations and not alpha-Linolenic acid, which is inefficiently metabolized to EPA and DHA in dogs and cats,\u201d he says. This means marine sources like algae should be used instead of land-based plant sources like flaxseed oil."}]
