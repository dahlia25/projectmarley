This over-the-counter (OTC) medication frequently makes the ASPCA&#039;s Animal Poison Control Center\u2019s list of top 10 causes of poisonings in dogs and cats. Tylenol can lead to severe health issues like liver toxicity and dysfunction of the oxygen-carrying ability of your pet\u2019s blood. \u00a0 Dogs and OTC Medications Like Tylenol For your pet\u2019s safety, never give them anything OTC without talking to your veterinarian. This includes medications like acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, or any other OTC medication. Animal hospitals consistently see well-intentioned owners cause harm to a beloved pet by administering these and other medications without veterinarian approval. Harm can occur via the actual medication and dose that was given, leading to toxicity, or simply by the owner\u2019s delay in seeking promptly needed veterinary care. Because of that, you should only give acetaminophen if directed by a veterinarian. Do Vets Ever Prescribe Tylenol? At this time, acetaminophen is not commonly recommended by veterinarians in dogs for many different reasons, never in cats. One reason is safety. Acetaminophen is NOT as safe for dogs as it is for humans. In fact, many veterinary toxicologists label acetaminophen as having a low safety margin for pets. Oftentimes, if a veterinarian is prescribing acetaminophen to a dog, it is being prescribed in addition to other medications as a part of a multidrug pain plan in dogs that are in great pain. Tylenol, on its own, can have some effect on pain in dogs, but it does not affect inflammation, which means it may not be an ideal solo drug choice for effectively treating many pain conditions in pets.\u00a0 Many medications are labeled, tested, and approved for dogs specifically, and they are proven to help treat pain and inflammation. So, veterinarians will recommend these pain and anti-inflammatory medications instead.\u00a0 Tylenol is also considered off label for animals, which means there has been no government regulated approval, and minimal studies are available on its use in dogs. Risks of Tylenol Toxicity in Dogs Not only is Tylenol a risk on its own, but it\u2019s often combined with other active ingredients that may be harmful to your pet.\u00a0 Exposure to acetaminophen at toxic doses can have serious effects on a dog\u2019s health that require prompt action and aggressive treatment by a veterinarian. Tylenol is processed in your pet\u2019s liver through two main pathways. When those two pathways are overwhelmed, the body is unable to inactivate a dangerous acetaminophen metabolite, which can cause injury to the liver and death. This metabolite also prevents affected blood cells from carrying oxygen. And if a dog has liver disease, acetaminophen may worsen it due to the already decreased ability to metabolize the Tylenol. Signs of Tylenol Toxicity in Dogs The diagnosis of Tylenol toxicity in dogs often depends on the history that an owner gives the veterinarian. Signs of Tylenol toxicity can look like a lot of other illnesses but include the following: Lethargy and depression Increased breathing rate Blue, brown, or yellow gums Vomiting and dehydration Swelling of the face or paws If you notice any of these signs or suspect that your pet has ingested Tylenol, contact your veterinarian right away and prepare to go to the animal hospital. Even if you have the best intentions, you can cause harm to your pets by administering OTC medications without veterinarian approval.\u00a0 If you are concerned that your pet that may be in pain, talk with your veterinarian about prescribing pain medications. This will lead to the best overall care for your pets. By: Dr. Monica Tarantino, DVM Featured Image: iStock.com/Andrii Borodai"}]
