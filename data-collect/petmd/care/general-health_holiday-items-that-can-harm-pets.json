Check out these holiday safety tips to know what items are not pet-safe.", "articleBody": "The holidays bring plenty of joy and celebrations, but the merrymaking could put your pet in harm\u2019s way. Many of the decorations, foods, and festivities we associate with the holidays could cause big problems for your pet, putting them at risk for everything from indigestion to death. Here&#039;s a list of potential holiday pet hazards, plus tips for keeping your pets safe this season. 1. Fatty Foods People often use the holidays as an opportunity to indulge in rich, fattening foods. But you\u2019re not doing your pets any favors by\u00a0sharing your favorite holiday treats with them, says\u00a0Dr. Rachel Barrack, DVM, of New York City\u2019s Animal Acupuncture. In dogs, \u201cthese rich foods can result in\u00a0pancreatitis, a painful inflammation of the pancreas that causes vomiting and diarrhea,\u201d she says, and both dogs and cats can develop an upset stomach when they eat anything out of the ordinary. 2. Chocolate Who doesn\u2019t snack on sweet treats during the holidays? However, our pets should not be able to get their paws on any chocolate. Dogs have a sweet tooth and amazing noses, says\u00a0Dr. Tina Wismer, Medical Director of the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center. If that combination leads them to a plate of brownies or a box of dark chocolates, they can develop vomiting, diarrhea, muscle tremors,\u00a0seizures, and\u00a0heart failure. Chocolate is toxic to cats as well as dogs and causes many of the same symptoms. So, it\u2019s important to keep your chocolate treats safely stored away from your pets. 3. Grapes and Raisins Whether they\u2019re part of a fruit plate or dried raisins in a fruitcake, grapes and raisins should never be accessible to pets. Dr. Barrack explains that\u00a0grapes and raisins are toxic for dogs\u00a0and can lead to acute kidney failure. While cats are less inclined to eat grapes, they can still be harmful for them as well. 4. Sugar-Free Candies and Pastries Another potentially dangerous treat is sugar-free pastries and candies, says Dr. Wismer. These often contain the sugar substitute xylitol. In dogs, this can cause\u00a0low blood sugar levels\u00a0and\u00a0liver failure. 5. Onions and Garlic On the savory side,\u00a0onions\u00a0and\u00a0garlic\u00a0can affect red blood cells and cause\u00a0anemia\u00a0when consumed in excessive amounts, says Dr. Wismer.\u00a0 Keep all forms\u2014raw, cooked, chopped, or powdered\u2014out of your pet\u2019s reach, and call your vet right away if you suspect that your pet has ingested onions or garlic. Cats are especially susceptible to onion and garlic toxicity. 6. Meat Bones Dogs might enjoy having a nice big bone to chew on, but cooked meat bones\u00a0can splinter and cause a blockage or lacerations in the gastrointestinal tract, says Dr. Barrack. Raw bones have less of a chance of splintering, but they can transmit disease-causing pathogens. Chewing on anything hard can also cause\u00a0broken teeth. Instead of giving them to your pup, throw those leftover turkey or\u00a0chicken bones\u00a0in the trash and stick to pet-safe treats. Dogs might enjoy having a nice big bone to chew on, but cooked meat bones can splinter and cause a blockage or lacerations in the gastrointestinal tract.7. Alcohol Pets should never be given alcohol, says Dr. Barrack, because it depresses the nervous system. Dogs and cats can get drunk just like people, says Dr. Wismer, and alcohol poisoning can lead to dangerously low blood pressure, body temperature, and blood sugar levels, plus tremors, seizures, comas, and death. Mixed drinks can be especially problematic. They\u2019re stronger than beer and wine, and many holiday drinks are made with a dairy base (such as White Russians and eggnog), which is attractive to dogs and cats. 8. Poinsettias Most\u00a0holiday plants, such as poinsettias, can cause mild oral irritation and gastrointestinal distress, says Dr. Barrack. Symptoms of irritation from poinsettias include: Drooling Licking lips Vomiting Diarrhea Though it\u2019s best to keep this holiday plant away from cats and dogs, medical treatment is rarely necessary for pets that ingest poinsettias. 9. Lilies Other plants are far more dangerous. Even tiny amounts of certain\u00a0types of lilies\u00a0can cause\u00a0kidney failure in cats, says Dr. Barrack. Lilies can also cause problems for your dog, too.\u00a0Lily exposure in dogs\u00a0can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, and other symptoms. The lilies that are especially dangerous to cats include: Tiger lilies Day lilies Asiatic lilies Easter lilies Japanese Show lilies Even tiny amounts of certain\u00a0types of lilies\u00a0can cause\u00a0kidney failure in cats.10. Holly If ingested, holly plants can cause\u00a0vomiting\u00a0and\u00a0diarrhea in cats\u00a0and dogs, says Dr. Barrack. Injuries from their spiny leaves can also cause excessive drooling, lip smacking, and headshaking. 11. Mistletoe You might want to hang up traditional mistletoe, but this popular Christmas decoration should be kept away from pets. If ingested, the plant can cause stomach problems. Large amounts may lead to\u00a0hypotension, seizures, and even death, says Dr. Barrack. 12. Candles Whether you\u2019re lighting a menorah, adding ambiance to your dinner setting, or placing candles in the window, be sure to keep pets far away from open flames. \u201cHanukkah is the festival of lights, but make sure your pet cannot come into contact with a lit menorah,\u201d says Dr. Barrack. Dr. Wismer agrees: \u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone knocking the table over or setting their tails on fire.\u201d Don\u2019t assume that a curious cat would never jump up on a mantle or table and accidentally catch their tail in the flame. 13. Christmas Trees While the Christmas tree is an essential part of holiday decor for many families, your pets see it more as a new toy to explore. You will need to take some precautionary measures to\u00a0keep your Christmas tree safe\u00a0from pets\u2014and vice versa. Cats are especially curious about Christmas trees. Whether your tree is real or fake, make sure it\u2019s properly secured and has some sort of barrier to\u00a0deter cats from going for a climb, says Dr. Barrack. In addition to ruining your decorating work, cats could injure themselves in the tree. If your tree is real, don\u2019t let cats or dogs drink from the water reservoir\u2014especially if you use a fertilizer. Drinking this stagnant water can cause vomiting and diarrhea. 14. Ornaments and Snow Globes Aside from the tree itself, the ornaments can also pose a hazard. Glass ornaments can break, cutting pets\u2019 paws or faces, says Dr. Barrack. If ingested, they can also cause gastrointestinal blockages and lacerations. Snow globes and bubble-shaped holiday lights may also contain poisonous chemicals such as ethylene glycol, she says, which can cause kidney failure in pets. 15. Tinsel, String, and Ribbons \u201cTinsel is one of the most dangerous items\u00a0that we can put on the tree,\u201d says Dr. Wismer. It\u2019s made from plastic or metal, which can cut through a curious cat\u2019s digestive tract, so it\u2019s best to skip this shiny tree-topper. Strings of popcorn or cranberries, as well as ribbons on presents, can cause similar problems for pets. 16. Electrical Cords Electrical cords can present a hazard\u00a0for pets as well. And during the holiday season, there always tends to be more around the house for the decorations and lights. \u201cIf chewed, live electrical cords can cause oral burns, seizures, and even death,\u201d says Dr. Barrack. Make sure to keep holiday lighting unplugged and out of reach when pets are unsupervised. 17. Houseguests \u201cWe always talk about grandma&#039;s purse being one of the most dangerous things in the house for pets,\u201d says Dr. Wismer. It can contain items like medications, sugar-free gum, and over-the-counter pain meds, all of which can be bad news for pets. Ask guests not to leave bags or purses on the floor. If they\u2019re staying the night, keep the guest room door closed so pets don\u2019t get into their suitcases. Having lots of people in the home can also be stressful for dogs and cats, Dr. Barrack says, so give your pet a safe and quiet place to relax. Changes made to the home, like moving a litter box out of a guest room or changing your dog walking routine, can cause a lot of stress for pets. There\u2019s also the danger that indoor pets can get loose if the front or back door is left open. Make sure your pets have\u00a0collars\u00a0and\u00a0microchips, Dr. Wismer says. 18. Heaters and Warming Devices Space heaters, heated blankets, and other warming devices could cause trouble if your pet knocks them over, tangles the cords, or moves them from their original position. You should also never use kerosene heaters indoors, warns Dr. Wismer. These could pose a carbon monoxide risk, potentially poisoning you and your pets. 19. Fireplaces Another heating hazard is the fireplace, including fire logs. \u201cFor some reason, dogs love to chew on these,\u201d Dr. Wismer says. They\u2019re not poisonous, but they could cause an obstruction in the dog\u2019s digestive tract. Also be sure to clean the ashes out of the fireplace. They\u2019re very alkaline, Dr. Wismer says, and could cause burns if ingested. 20. Cleaning Supplies Whether you\u2019re getting the house ready for holiday guests or cleaning up after them, keep pets far away from cleaning supplies that contain chemicals such as ammonia, bleach, and chlorine.\u00a0 \u201cEven all-natural products can cause stomach irritation,\u201d says Dr. Barrack. Some of the essential oils used in \u201cnatural\u201d cleaning products are quite toxic, especially to cats. \u201cKeep your pets in a separate area until all recently cleaned surfaces are dry,\u201d she says. 21. Rock Salt While there have been many innovations in\u00a0making rock salt safer for pets, the reality is that not all municipalities have made the switch.\u00a0Protect your pets\u2019 paws\u00a0with dog boots, or wash their feet thoroughly after each winter walk. Rock salts and other ice-melting chemicals can cause stomach upset or, potentially, electrolyte problems when they\u2019re swallowed, says Dr. Wismer. When trapped in your pet\u2019s paws, they can also cause abrasions and ulcerations that lead to pain and infection. 22. Antifreeze There have also been moves to make antifreeze less appealing to pets by adding a bittering agent that discourages them from lapping it up. But it\u2019s not a foolproof solution. Safer pet-friendly types of antifreeze are available, but who knows what type of antifreeze is dripping out of your neighbor\u2019s car! Always clean up antifreeze spills thoroughly and call your vet if you suspect that your pet has ingested even a drop. Antifreeze can cause kidney failure and death.
