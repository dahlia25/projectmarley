Check out these fun activities to do with your dog in your backyard.", "articleBody": "Everyone knows that dogs love romping around the backyard. But many pet parents may be surprised to learn that it\u2019s not enough to simply open the door and let their pup entertain himself. \u201cBeing in the backyard might give dogs some sunshine and open space, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily give them anything to do,\u201d says Andrea Servadio, a trainer and cofounder of Los Angeles-based Fitdog Sports Club. \u201cJust like for humans, play offers mental, physical and emotional enrichment.\u201d Not only is playing outside fun, but it will likely lead to better behavior when inside the house. \u201cPlaying encourages mental stimulation for a dog,\u201d says Colleen Demling-Riley, a canine behaviorist at Dogtopia, a daycare, spa and boarding facility. \u201cWhen you combine mental exercise with physical exercise, you will have a well-behaved, balanced and tired pup when your dog comes back in the house,\u201d says Demling-Riley. When it comes to fun activities to do with your dog while outside, there is no shortage of options. From dog fetch toys and agility courses to water games and scent work, the only limitation on outdoor fun is your imagination. Upgrade Your Fetch Game A time-honored classic, fetch never goes out of style. \u201cDogs love fetch because it mimics their natural instincts to hunt and retrieve prey,\u201d says Servadio. \u201cBalls tend to bounce in predictable ways, so finding dog toys\u00a0that have unusual bounces increases engagement and mental stimulation.\u201d Servadio recommends tossing anything from rope tug toys\u00a0to dog plush toys. Or, you can upgrade your game with a specially designed dog fetch toy. Dog flyer discs, such as the Nerf Dog atomic flyer dog toy and West Paw Zogoflex Zisc dog toy, are engineered to both float through the air and bounce on the ground, making both the chase and the catch more interesting. Is your best bud a long-distance runner? Dog ball launchers, like the Chuckit! classic launcher, can help you throw up to three times farther, which means a whole lot more running for your canine companion. Automatic launchers, such as the iFetch Mini automatic ball launcher dog toy, can also make great backyard toys for dogs. \u201cSome dogs may not be as interested in playing if you\u2019re not involved, while others\u00a0just want to get that ball\u00a0regardless of who or what is throwing it,\u201d says Servadio. Set Up Dog Agility Activities When most people hear \u201cagility,\u201d they think of specially trained dogs competing on a professional course. However, any dog can benefit from backyard agility work. \u201cAny activity where dogs learn a new skill, get positive feedback and feel accomplished is going to make them feel good,\u201d says Servadio. Agility engages dogs in a few different ways, explains Servadio. The equipment and coursework provide mental stimulation while teaching new tricks and skills. Agility also provides rigorous physical exercise and opportunities to use and develop a large variety of muscles. It\u2019s easy to set up your own agility course. \u201cAgility equipment designed for a pet parent\u2019s backyard is now readily available at good price points,\u201d says Demling-Riley. \u201cPlaying with agility equipment never gets old because you can always change the order of the obstacles or make them more difficult as your dog\u2019s skill level advances.\u201d Dog agility kits, such as the Outward Hound Zip &amp; Zoom indoor agility kit for dogs, provide everything you need to get your pup started. If you want to work on your dog\u2019s tunnel skills, the tear-resistant HDP collapsible agility dog training tunnel is perfect for backyard training and play sessions. \u00a0 Engage Your Pup in Scent Work Dogs loves sniffing everything and anything. Good smells, bad smells, questionable smells\u2014each one is worthy of a lengthy inspection. For a fun backyard game, challenge your dog\u2019s curious nose to a scent work game. \u201cScent work is great mental stimulation for a dog and is a fun outdoor activity after being inside all winter,\u201d says Demling-Riley. Demling-Riley suggests this game of smell-and-seek: While your dog is inside, place six cardboard boxes throughout your yard. Keep the lids open, then place dog treats\u00a0in three of them. (For a high-protein option, try Blue Buffalo Wilderness Trail Treats duck biscuits.) Then, take your dog outside to explore the yard on a dog leash. When he detects a treat, calmly praise him without petting him, as petting can interfere with tracking. As your pup gets better at the game, you can close the lids and even hide the boxes around your yard. Scent work is exhausting, says Demling-Riley, so give your pup a break within 10 minutes, and be sure he always has access to fresh water. For a simpler version, hide a smelly, chewy dog treat in the yard, and set your pup loose. \u201cThis is super fun for most dogs because once they find their chew item, they get to eat it,\u201d says Demling-Riley. Play Some Water Games Many dogs enjoy water games in the backyard, too. \u201cA warm, sunny spring day is a great time for water games,\u201d says Demling-Riley. \u201cSimply turn on your sprinkler and watch your dog run back and forth with joy.\u201d If you don\u2019t have a sprinkler, she suggests putting some dog ball toys, like tennis balls, in a bucket of water or dog pool and encouraging your dog to grab the balls as they bob up and down. Do a Round of Hide-and-Seek Another fun kid game your pup may enjoy is hide-and-seek. While you hide in your yard, have another family member hold your dog, says Demling-Riley. Once you\u2019re in your hiding spot, call your dog\u2019s name. When he finds you, reward him with lots of praise, then play the game again. \u201cMost dogs learn to love this game!\u201d says Demling-Riley. \u201cPlus, it\u2019s a great way to reinforce them coming to you when you call them.\u201d There\u2019s nothing like enjoying some fresh air with your pup. In addition to providing your dog with exercise and mental stimulation, playing together is a wonderful way to strengthen the human-canine bond.
