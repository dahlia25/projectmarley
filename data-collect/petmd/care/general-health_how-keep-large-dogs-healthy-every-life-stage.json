These include common health issues found in large dog breeds, their specific nutritional needs, and their physical activity requirements. You also need to know how these needs will vary as large dogs transition through different life stages. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what you need to know about large dog breeds during every life stage. Jump to Section: Weight Range for Large Dog BreedsHealth Issues in Large Dog BreedsLife Span of Large Dog BreedsPuppy: 0-18 MonthsAdult: 18 Months \u2013 7 YearsSenior: 7-16 YearsWhat\u2019s the Weight Range for Large Dog Breeds? Although there\u2019s no generally accepted large dog weight range, most veterinarians consider any dog\u2014regardless of breed or mix of breeds\u2014that weighs between 50-100 pounds to be a large-breed dog. Some also define a large dog as one that measures up to 24 inches in height (measured from the highest point of a dog\u2019s shoulders down to their paws). Examples of common large dog breeds include: Belgian Malinois Bernese Mountain Dog Boxer Catahoula Leopard Dog Doberman Pinscher German Shepherd Dog German Shorthaired Pointer Golden Retriever Irish Setter Labrador Retriever Old English Sheepdog Rottweiler Siberian Husky Staffordshire Terrier Standard Poodle Vizsla Weimaraner What Health Issues Do Large Dog Breeds Have? Although this may vary by breed and life stage, large dogs tend to have a higher incidence of these issues: Developmental orthopedic disorders Hip dysplasia/elbow dysplasia and subsequent arthritis (we can see early signs of hip or elbow dysplasia in affected large-breed puppies: limping, crying, having difficulty walking, or not being able to bear weight on their legs) Cruciate ligament/knee injuries Tumors of the spleen Lymphoma Mast cell tumors Dilated (taurine-deficient) cardiomyopathy Hypothyroidism Laryngeal paralysis Fast-growing, large-breed puppies can be predisposed to health issues like: Panosteitis, a painful leg bone condition that\u2019s often called \u201cgrowing pains\u201d (German Shepherd Dog) Hypertrophic osteodystrophy, an auto-inflammatory bone disease (Chesapeake Bay Retriever, Irish Setter, Boxer, German Shepherd, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever, Weimaraner) Osteochondritis dissecans, a joint disease caused by abnormal cartilage development (Bernese Mountain Dog, German Shepherd, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever, Rottweiler) How Long Do Large Dogs Live? The average life span of large dog breeds typically ranges from 10-12 years. But this is dependent on a number of factors, including: Breed Genetics Nutrition Individual health status How to Keep Large Dogs Healthy at Each Life Stage The nutritional, medical, physical, and behavioral needs of large dogs will change as they transition through each life stage. Here\u2019s a breakdown of their needs at every life stage. Large-Breed Puppy: 0-18 months A large-breed puppy does not have the same needs of a small-breed puppy or medium-sized puppy. Follow this guide to set them up for success. Nutritional Needs Large dog breeds have a very rapid growth rate, which can predispose them to certain developmental orthopedic disorders, especially in those that are fed an improper diet. Choosing a proper diet for your growing large puppy is crucial for their bone and joint development. Large-breed puppies require a very specific amount of protein, calcium, and phosphorus. However, it is a balancing act because too much protein can cause issues down the road. Your large puppy\u2019s food should have: 1.5% calcium content 30% high-quality protein 9% fat (dry-matter basis) Calcium to phosphorus ratio (Ca:P) of 1:1 to 1:3 Food labels will let you know how much to feed your large-breed puppy depending on their weight. Divide this amount into two or three meals per day and increase the amount per meal accordingly as your puppy grows. It is also important to note that your puppy\u2019s daily allotment of treats should not exceed 10% of their daily calorie intake. AAFCO-Certified for Large-Breed Puppies Most diets that are formulated for large-breed puppies and contain the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) seal of approval will meet these requirements. AAFCO publishes annual nutritional guidelines for animals of every life stage. An appropriate diet for a growing large puppy will have a variation of the following statement printed on the bag/can of food: \u201cThis food is formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO Dog Food Nutrient Profiles for growth of large-size dogs.\u201d Supplements If your puppy is receiving an appropriate diet, they will not require any additional supplements, specifically those containing calcium, as this can alter their Ca:P ratio. Medical Needs Your large-breed puppy will also have specific medical needs as they grow. Veterinary Care Your large-breed puppy should be seen by their veterinarian every three to four weeks until the age of 16 weeks for routine exams and vaccinations. Your vet will need to examine your puppy\u2019s: Eyes, ears, nose, and mouth Heart Lungs Skin Belly Paws Stool By checking all these areas, they can monitor for abnormalities such as: Heart murmurs Congenital defects Upper respiratory infections Pneumonia Hernias Cleft palates Orthopedic abnormalities Intestinal parasites Vaccines Vaccines help keep your puppy healthy and protected. Veterinarians recommend these core vaccines for all puppies: Rabies (required by law) Distemper, hepatitis, parainfluenza, parvovirus (DHPP; often given in a single vaccine) Vaccination against other diseases (Lyme disease, canine influenza, Bordetella, leptospirosis, etc.) should be discussed with your veterinarian at your puppy\u2019s first visit. If your puppy is at risk for any of these diseases and is healthy enough for vaccinations, please consider these important noncore vaccines, as well. Dental Care Most large-breed puppies will not require anesthetic dental cleanings/procedures yet. Exceptions include puppies that have broken their puppy teeth, have retained puppy teeth or unemerged adult teeth, or have been exposed to viruses or medications that affect proper enamel development. Since puppies are so adaptable, it\u2019s best to start getting them used to at-home dental care (brushing their teeth at home) at an early age. Vetoquinol Enzadent and Virbac C.E.T. Oral Hygiene Kit for dogs are two products you can try at home. Your veterinarian will examine your puppy\u2019s teeth at every visit and let you know the right time for your dog\u2019s first dental procedure.\u00a0 Spay/Neuter After your puppy completes their vaccine and deworming schedule, they should be examined every six months, including an appointment to discuss the recommended timing of their spay/neuter. There has been significant controversy over the best time to spay or neuter large dogs. A recent study summarizes the relationship between disease prevalence in the most common large-breed dogs and spaying and neutering at different ages. In general, there seems to be a smaller percentage of joint disorders (hip dysplasia, arthritis, cruciate tears) in male dogs that were neutered after reaching full maturity (&gt;2 years). There also appears to be a smaller percentage of hormone-responsive urinary incontinence in female dogs that were spayed after their first heat cycle. Due to varying opinions on the topic, it\u2019s recommended that you consult with your veterinarian regarding the best time to spay or neuter your large-breed puppy. Parasite Prevention Heartworm prevention should be started as early as possible in large-breed puppies (as early as 8 weeks of age, depending on your puppy\u2019s weight). Many areas can see year-round disease transmission due to the prevalence of mosquitos\u2014the carriers of heartworm disease. Consistent flea and tick prevention is also important due to the risk of tick-borne disease (ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, Lyme disease), flea allergies, and tapeworm (carried by fleas). Please consult with your veterinarian about the best flea, tick, and heartworm prevention for your dog\u2019s weight and age. Behavioral Needs Puppyhood is a crucial life stage for socialization, preventing phobias, and training. Socialization Your puppy\u2019s most important period for socialization is between 2-12 weeks of age. This is also the time when your puppy is most susceptible to disease, so make sure you find controlled environments where you can provide safe socialization experiences. Why Is Puppy Socialization Important? Tips for Socializing a Puppy 7 Dangers of Not Socializing Your Dog 6 Places That Are Bad for Dog Socialization Preventing Fears and Phobias From Developing Your puppy is most susceptible to developing fears or phobias at 8-10 weeks of age. Only use positive reinforcement and gentle handling, and never punish your dog (yelling, confining as a result of a behavior, rubbing their nose in their accidents). Avoid anxiety-inducing events during this time. Remember that events and situations that might not cause anxiety for you can cause anxiety for your dog. Training During this time, you will also want to start puppy training. Having large dog breeds comes with the responsibility of instilling good behaviors and habits while your dog is small and easy to manage. Once large dogs are fully grown, behaviors like jumping, chewing, nipping, and pulling on the leash become a lot more destructive, dangerous, and difficult to handle. Mental and Physical Stimulation As your puppy grows, it is important to provide physical and mental stimulation. This can come in many forms: Long walks Puppy playdates Training (at home or puppy training classes) Fetch games Puzzle toys, games, feeders Here are some toys that are appropriate for puppies: Nina Ottosson by Outward Hound Tornado puzzle game Nylabone Puppy Teething X Bone KONG Puppy dog toy KONG Puppy Activity Ball Trixie Move2Win strategy game Adult Large-Breed Dogs: 18 months \u2013 7 years As your puppy transitions into an adult dog, their needs will change. Here are some tips to help you prepare. Nutritional Needs As your large-breed puppy reaches an adult age and stops growing (usually around 12-18 months), they should be gradually transitioned to an appropriate large-breed adult diet over the course of seven days to avoid gastrointestinal (GI) upset. AAFCO-Certified for Adult Large-Breed Dogs Make sure that some variation of the following statement is published on the label: \u201cThis food is formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO Dog Food Nutrient Profiles for maintenance of large-size dogs.\u201d It\u2019s very important to maintain a healthy weight in adult large-breed dogs. Obesity can lead to early arthritis and negatively impact your pet\u2019s quality of life. Supplements You can also consider starting joint supplements such as glucosamine, chondroitin, methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), and omega-3 fatty acids in large dogs that have been diagnosed with any orthopedic abnormalities (hip/elbow dysplasia, arthritis, cruciate injuries, etc.). Ask your vet about options for supplements. These supplements are commonly recommended: Nutramax Dasuquin MSM soft chews Nutramax Cosequin DS Maximum Strength Nutramax Welactin Canine Omega-3 Medical Needs When they reach the adult stage, large dog breeds will have different medical needs from when they were puppies. Veterinary Care Your adult dog should receive veterinary exams every six months and be checked every six to 12 months for heartworms, tick-borne diseases, and intestinal parasites. Your veterinarian may recommend annual or semi-annual bloodwork, urinalysis, and possibly even x-rays to monitor your pet\u2019s general health and catch certain disease processes early. Vaccines Your veterinarian will ensure that your pet is up to date on their core vaccines (rabies, distemper, hepatitis, parainfluenza, parvovirus) and noncore vaccines, depending on exposure risk (Bordetella, Lyme disease, influenza, leptospirosis). Vaccine manufacturers guarantee an immunity that lasts one to three years, depending on the vaccine. If you have any questions about how often your pet should be vaccinated, please ask your veterinarian which vaccines your dog received and how long each vaccine is guaranteed to provide protection. In an effort to avoid over-vaccination, you may also ask your veterinarian about distemper/parvovirus titers, which can show whether your dog is still protected against these diseases and discourage the need for additional vaccination at a given point in time. Dental Care Your vet will also examine your dog\u2019s teeth at each visit to ensure appropriate oral health. They may recommend a dental cleaning if they see evidence of dental disease. Some large dogs will need annual or even semi-annual dental cleanings depending upon their breed, health status, diet, and history. Reproductive Health and Spay/Neuter If your male dog has not been neutered by the time he has reached an adult age, do not let him roam, and keep him separated from female dogs in heat to prevent unwanted litters. Your veterinarian will examine him at each visit to monitor for signs of prostatitis or testicular cancer. If you have any behavioral concerns with your intact male dog (aggression, marking behavior, roaming), ask your veterinarian whether neutering might be a viable option. If your female dog has not been spayed yet, please track her heat cycles, which should occur every six to eight months. If you notice any of these signs, talk with your veterinarian: Discharge from her vulva Mammary development Growths Lethargic behavior or a decreased appetite after a heat cycle Intact adult female dogs are at a higher risk for pyometra (uterine infection), roaming behavior, and mammary cancers. Parasite Prevention It\u2019s important to continue flea, tick, and heartworm prevention in adult large dog breeds. Mental and Physical Stimulation It is also important to provide appropriate mental and physical stimulation for your pet. This can include: Agility training Obstacle courses Puzzle toys or food-dispensing toys Fetch games Puppy playdates Digging in a designated area Nose-work games Frozen dog treats Long daily walks or runs Here are some toy options for adult dogs: Trixie Activity Flip Board ZippyPaws Burrow Squeaky Chipmunk Hide and Seek toy Senior Large-Breed Dogs: 7 \u2013 16 years As your pet reaches a senior age, you may notice signs of slowing down, such as: Not being able to walk as far Having difficulty jumping or getting up Sleeping more Having to be walked more often While these can be a normal part of the aging process, they can also be signs of disease. Talk to your vet if you have concerns, and take your senior dog for regular checkups. Here are some other considerations for senior large dog breeds. Nutritional Needs\u00a0 Once your dog begins to reach \u201csenior\u201d age (approximately 7 years), they can be gradually transitioned to an appropriate senior diet over the course of seven days to avoid GI upset. Although most adult large breed dog foods will suffice, there are diets that are formulated specifically for senior large breed dogs. They usually contain omega-3 fatty acids, glucosamine, and vitamins and minerals to help maintain joint and cognitive health. Make sure that your pet\u2019s food has the AAFCO seal of approval. Supplements At this age, it is more important than ever to maintain a healthy weight. This will alleviate the pressure on your dog\u2019s joints and keep them feeling better for longer. You may want to consider joint supplements (glucosamine, chondroitin, MSM, essential fatty acids) for your senior dog if they are not already receiving them. Essential fatty acids can also be helpful for cognitive function. Probiotics, like Purina Pro Plan Fortiflora or Nutramax Proviable DC have been shown to maintain gut health and boost your pet\u2019s immunity as well. Your veterinarian can help you find the most appropriate senior diet and supplements for your dog\u2019s lifestyle and physical needs. Medical Needs As your large dog becomes a senior, trips to the vet will become more frequent, and they will have different health needs. Veterinary Care Your senior dog should be thoroughly examined every six months by their veterinarian. It\u2019s even more important at this stage to monitor your pet\u2019s dental, cardiovascular, and joint health, as well as their blood work/urine. This is usually when you will start seeing signs of arthritis, endocrine disease, heart disease, liver and kidney disease, and cancer. Your veterinarian will look for heart murmurs, masses or growths, dental disease, and arthritis, and will likely recommend blood work and a urinalysis to screen for underlying conditions that may not be apparent upon physical examination. Vaccines At your dog\u2019s semi-annual visit, your veterinarian will ensure that your pet is up to date on their core vaccines and checked for heartworm (and tick-borne) disease and intestinal parasites. Dental Care It\u2019s very important to keep up with your senior large dog\u2019s dental care. Your veterinarian will check your dog\u2019s teeth at each visit and monitor for signs of dental disease. Parasite Prevention Senior dogs should still be on regular heartworm and flea/tick prevention. Mobility Issues One of the most common issues we see with older large-breed dogs is problems with mobility. It\u2019s important to keep your dog\u2019s nails trimmed and to address joint pain. There are a variety of treatments for joint pain, such as: Anti-inflammatories Pain medications Laser therapy Acupuncture Physical therapy Injectable joint medications (Adequan, platelet-rich plasma, stem cell therapy, etc.) Ask your veterinarian which therapy they recommend for your dog\u2019s mobility issues. There are also ways that you can make your home more comfortable and easier to navigate for your senior dog. Here are a few options: Ramps Orthopedic beds Yoga mats Carpets/rugs Memory foam mats Adhesive paw pads Booties Slings Mental and Physical Stimulation Continue exercising your dog (physically and mentally) as much as they can tolerate. Your pet will let you know how much activity is too much. Consider short, frequent walks or swims, gentle games of fetch, puzzle toys and games, training, or obstacle courses. While it\u2019s important to monitor their physical health, you should also monitor your dog\u2019s mental health as they age. Just because your dog is a senior doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t need mental stimulation. Try the KONG Senior dog toy or Outward Hound Hide a Squirrel Squeaky toy. You can keep them mentally stimulated through play and games. These do not have to be high-energy games; there are lots of low-impact activities you can do with your senior dog. As larger dogs age, you should also monitor them for signs of dog dementia (canine cognitive dysfunction). Notify your vet if you notice behavioral changes, such as: Altered sleep/wake cycles Anxiety Excessive barking Pacing Incontinence Confusion Disorientation Your vet will rule out underlying health issues and discuss medications (e.g., selegiline), supplements, and diets that can help in cases of canine cognitive dysfunction. End-of-Life Care Unfortunately, there will likely come a time in your pet\u2019s life where you will have to consider your pet\u2019s quality of life and whether humane euthanasia is the best choice for your pet. This is never an easy decision, and it can be incredibly difficult to separate your emotions from the process. However, there are tools like the \u201cQuality of Life Scale\u201d that can help you evaluate your pet\u2019s life, and you can talk with your veterinarian about your options. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask your veterinarian any questions you have regarding your pet\u2019s quality of life or end-of-life care.
