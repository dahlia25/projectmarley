Learn more about how gunpowder is dangerous to dogs.", "articleBody": "By Aly Semigran Whether you take your dog hunting with you, or plan to have him in the vicinity of any holiday festivities that involve fireworks (be it your own backyard, or in a public setting), it\u2019s important to understand the risks that gunpowder poses to canines. What is Gunpowder? \u201cMost gunpowder is made of a few ingredients: potassium nitrate (saltpeter), carbon, and sulfur. If the source is fireworks, the powder may also include chlorates, aluminum, copper, and soluble barium salt,\u201d relays Dr. Lindy West, DVM, of West River Veterinary Clinic. Is Gunpowder Harmful To Dogs? If a dog ingests gunpowder from guns and/or fireworks, it can make him ill. \u201cIn most cases, we see vomiting and diarrhea,\u201d says Dr. Charlotte Means, the director of toxicology for the ASPCA\u2019s Animal Poison Control Center. The potassium nitrate ingredient in gunpowder is what causes these abdominal issues. While ingestion is unlikely to be lethal, it can cause problems such as low blood pressure. Ingestion of a large amount of gunpowder may also cause methemoglobinemia in dogs, a condition where the blood is oxidized so it can\u2019t carry oxygen well. If you\u2019re dog is vomiting, it\u2019s possible that he could have consumed a shell casing, which could cause blockages or other internal complications. Make sure to visit a vet if your dog is vomiting and you think gunpowder or shell casings may be to blame. What Should You Do If Your Dog Ingests Gunpowder? Dogs will likely vomit up the gunpowder they\u2019ve ingested, which, as Means notes, works as \u201cself-decontamination.\u201d Still, if your dog has ingested gunpowder, be it from a gun casing or a firework, West urges calling a veterinarian for support and care. Keeping Your Dog Safe Around Gunpowder \u201cWhen shooting off fireworks, keep pets far away or in the house,\u201d West says. \u201cIf you find any fireworks or ammunition within reach of your pet, whether it&#039;s while you&#039;re out for a walk or in the house, pick it up and place it in the trash.\u201d Means also points out that illegal fireworks are likely to have larger quantities of gunpowder in them and dogs should be kept away from them. Both Means and West urge pet parents to keep dogs away from firework shows, and Means points out that owners should still be on the lookout for leftover fireworks, even after the display is over. For instance, if municipal fireworks are set off at a local park, she advises not walking the dog in the area shortly afterwards. \u201cThe dog could accidentally ingest [the ashes] the next day when people are walking them where the fireworks display was,\u201d Means warns, adding that the barium salts which are used to make colors in fireworks can cause a life-threatening situation if ingested. \u201cWe can see vomiting, diarrhea,\u00a0 drooling, a slow heart rate, muscle weakness that can develop to paralysis, high blood pressure, abnormal heart rhythms, and shock,\u201d she explains. If you do happen to walk with your dog in an area where fireworks were set off, wipe his paws with a baby wipe or a wet rag to remove any traces of potential gunpowder. Debunking A Dangerous Myth About Dogs and Gunpowder If you perform a Google search for \u201cdogs and gunpowder\u201d one of the top results you\u2019ll come across is a theory that if you feed the powder to dogs, they\u2019ll become more aggressive as a fighting and/or guard dog. It should go without saying that this is not only a harmful myth, but one that should never be tested out on any dog, as evident by the health risks involved, as well as the cruelty factor. This practice is staunchly discouraged by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, and as member Mike Bazinet blatantly states, \u201cNo one in their right mind would feed gunpowder to a dog or any other living thing.
