While the standard age range for senior dogs varies by breed and size, pet parents should watch for signs of aging and make necessary adjustments to provide their pets with the best senior dog care available. How to Take Care of Senior Dogs If you need to take care of a dog who is older, making subtle changes to your dog\u2019s routine, veterinary care and home environment can help them live a healthier and more comfortable life. Tip 1: Keep Your Senior Dog Active As dogs age, it\u2019s important that they continue to get plenty of exercise, says Dr. Sarah Wooten, DVM, a veterinarian based in Greeley, Colorado. \u201cIf you don&#039;t move it, you lose it,\u201d she says. \u201cMuscle mass is the main driver of metabolism, and dogs that lose muscle mass develop frailty syndrome, which accelerates the aging process.\u201d If a dog\u2019s activity level gradually decreases over time, it could be a sign that something is wrong. Owners of old dogs, says Dr. Wooten, should watch for subtle signs of pain and visit a veterinarian to come up with an ideal treatment plan. \u201cPet parents still think that &#039;slowing down&#039; is normal for old age,\u201d she says. \u201cIt isn&#039;t\u2014it is indicative of untreated pain.\u201d Dog monitors that attach to a dog collar, such as the Whistle 3 dog GPS tracker and activity monitor, are useful tools that are designed help pet parents keep tabs of their dog\u2019s activity level. If activity levels are low, dog owners can adjust a pet\u2019s exercise routine to include more playtime or longer walks. Keeping your senior dog active will also help prevent weight gain. \u201cKeeping your dog thin is the most important thing you can do to help minimize the effects of arthritis,\u201d says Dr. Wooten. Tip 2: Get Your Dog\u2019s Blood Work Checked As dogs get older, it\u2019s a good idea to see your veterinarian on a regular basis for checkups, says Dr. Justine Lee, a board-certified emergency care and toxicology specialist and author of &quot;It&#039;s a Dog&#039;s Life... but It&#039;s Your Carpet.&quot; Besides an annual or biannual exam, Dr. Lee suggests that pet parents get yearly blood work done for their senior dogs. \u201cI generally recommend doing blood work to check their white and red blood cells and their kidney and liver function to make sure that they&#039;re healthy,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is an easy way of being able to detect any kind of disease.\u201d Tip 3: Invest in an Orthopedic or Heated Dog Bed If you want to take care of a dog that is getting up there in age, splurging on an orthopedic dog bed\u00a0or a heated dog bed\u00a0may help senior dogs that are suffering from arthritis and other joint problems, says Dr. Wooten. She recommends dog beds from the brand Big Barker, such as the Big Barker pillow-top orthopedic dog bed. \u201cA pain-free, restful sleep is huge for older dogs,\u201d she says. \u201cIt can improve mobility, reduce pain and improve quality of life.\u201d A heated dog bed, like the K&amp;H Pet Products ortho thermo pet bed, may help a senior dog with stiffness and joint problems. It has a built-in heater that warms up to your dog\u2019s natural body temperature. You can place a heated pad or mat into your dog\u2019s bed for a similar effect. \u201cConsider electric warming pads that are thermostatically controlled and have emergency shut-offs if they overheat,\u201d says Dr. Raelynn Farnsworth, DVM, head of the community practice service at Washington State University\u2019s College of Veterinary Medicine. \u201cSuch a pad will provide substantial relief for the achiness of age-related arthritis.\u201d The K&amp;H Pet Products pet bed warmer is specifically designed not to exceed the natural body temperature of your dog. It fits inside most pet beds and is MET listed for safety. This means that it has been tested at a \u201cNationally Recognized Testing Laboratory\u201d to ensure quality and safety standards. \u00a0 Tip 4: Try Using a Dog Support Sling If your senior dog has mobility problems, a dog support sling\u00a0or a specially designed dog harness\u00a0can be a big help, says Dr. Lee. \u201cIf your dog has a really hard time getting up, sometimes using a dog sling can help them,\u201d she says. Dr. Wooten agrees. \u201cThere are great harnesses available that have a handle on the back so you can easily assist your dog,\u201d she says. Dog support slings, such as the Kurgo Up &amp; About dog lifter, are designed to help make walking, climbing stairs, going to the bathroom or getting into the car easier for your senior dog. \u00a0 Tip 5: Make Small Changes to Your Dog\u2019s Environment If you have a senior dog, making small adjustments to your home and his environment can have a big impact. Dr. Lee suggests putting down more carpeting around your home so that your senior dog will have an easier time getting up and will be less likely to slip on hardwood or tile floors. Dog socks\u00a0with rubberized, non-slip soles, like the Canada Pooch Cambridge dog socks, can also help provide traction for senior dogs. Dr. Lee also recommends that senior dog parents consider using dog ramps\u00a0throughout their homes. Dr. Wooten agrees that ramps are a good option for senior dogs. \u201cRamps are a wonderful way to help dogs get into cars, up and down stairs and onto furniture,\u201d she says. The Solvit UltraLite Bi-Fold pet ramp is a foldable dog ramp option that can assist dogs and then store away easily in a closet or under a bed. For a more permanent option that won\u2019t clash with your decor, try the Solvit wood bedside dog ramp.\u00a0 Additionally, pet parents may need to reevaluate the dog food\u00a0and water setup they have for their dog in order to provide extra comfort and ease of use. Dr. Wooten recommends that pet parents should consider an elevated dog bowl\u00a0for their dog\u2019s food and water to eliminate excess strain on a dog\u2019s head and neck. Dr. Farnsworth says senior dog parents should make finding a water bowl easier for their aging pups. \u201cYou may have to increase the number of water bowls around the home if the pet has trouble remembering where any single bowl may be located,\u201d she says. \u201cA nightlight by the food and water can help, too.\u201d Night vision is the first type to dissipate over time, so it can help your aging pet to put up nightlights throughout the home. You can also block stairways by using dog gates\u00a0such as the Regalo Easy Step walk-through gate."}]
