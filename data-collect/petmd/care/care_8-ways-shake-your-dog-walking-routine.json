In fact, a study from Michigan State University concluded that dog owners are 34 percent more likely to get in the recommended 150 minutes of exercise each week compared to non-dog owners. A study done at George Washington University School of Public Health and Health Services found that individuals who walk dogs on a regular basis are less at risk for certain self-reported diseases such as Type 2 diabetes and hypertension. \u201cWalking your dog is an important low-impact exercise for both you and your dog,\u201d says Dr. Bruce Silverman, owner of Village West Veterinary in Chicago and founder of the Critical Animal Relief Foundation (CARF). \u201cIt helps with blood circulation and to burn calories. It&#039;s also a critical bonding time for people and their pets.\u201d But if walking your dog has become a chore rather than a bright spot in your day-to-day routine, it\u2019s time to shake things up. Try these eight dog walking tips to bring some new excitement to your outdoor strolls. 1. Let your dog make the decisions. If you\u2019re used to walking your dog around the block on the same route every night, it\u2019s probably time for a change. \u201cEvery so often, allow your dog to determine the route,\u201d says John D. Visconti, CDPT-KA, owner of Rising Star Dog Training in North Carolina. \u201cChanging the walk route allows the dog to encounter novel scents and new scenery. Dogs love routines, but to get the most out of your walks, don\u2019t become robotic about them.\u201d 2. Use some training treats. Most dogs are food-motivated, so bringing along dog training treats\u00a0on a dog walk can spur interactions between you and your pet, and help reenergize a walk. \u201cFor many dogs who are driven by food, treating them a few times along the walk can help to motivate them and get them excited for the next walk,\u201d says celebrity dog trainer Joel Silverman. Silverman recommends small, bite-sized training treats, like Bil-Jac Little Jacs small dog chicken liver training dog treats, for treating during walks, but make sure you don\u2019t overdo it. Too many treats will negate some of the health benefits of the walk.\u00a0 3. Walk in a new location. Besides just changing the dog walking route in your neighborhood or near your home, consider hopping in the car and driving to a whole new spot for your dog\u2019s weekend walks. \u201cTaking the same walk over and over again can get really boring,\u201d says Dr. B. Silverman. \u201cTry visiting parks, neighborhoods or forest preserves you&#039;ve never explored.\u201d 4. Change up the pace. If you\u2019re used to going at one speed from start to finish, consider changing up the pace of your dog walking. \u201cNot only should the route be changed, but the pace of the walk should be varied as well,\u201d says Visconti. \u201cOccasionally, take a look at [your dog] and happily say, \u2018Let\u2019s go!\u2019 and then quicken your pace\u2014even if only for a short distance.\u201d If you decide to jog or run, consider using a hands-free dog leash.\u00a0 5. Incorporate training for fun interactions. Pet parents should consider walks as an opportune time to interact with their dogs and practice training in a fun environment. \u201cEvery walk presents an opportunity for interaction and bond building,\u201d says Visconti. \u201cDoing simple things like asking your dog to sit\u2014and paying for performance with a high-value treat\u2014is an easy way to interact with your dog, and a way to make the walk more enjoyable for all involved.\u201d 6. Switch up your dog\u2019s walking partners. If the same person in your household always walks your dog, consider passing on the dog leash\u00a0to another member of your family. \u201cBecause walking is prime bonding time, everyone who lives in the house should walk the dog,\u201d says J. Silverman. 7. Try a group walk with other dogs. If your dog is social and friendly, getting together with some other dogs in the neighborhood for a group walk can add to the enjoyment of your dog walking routine. \u201cGroup walks can be a great experience for both dog and owner as long as the dogs know each other,\u201d says J. Silverman. 8. Let loose and have fun. Dog walking shouldn\u2019t be monotonous, says Visconti, so put away your phone and use the opportunity to just enjoy the time with your dog. Let your guard down and be a little bit silly. \u201cSing to your dog. Dance with your dog. Interact with your dog. Be happy,\u201d he says. \u201cWalks should be fun. If they are, they won\u2019t become boring or routine.\u201d Image via iStock.com/DuxX"}]
