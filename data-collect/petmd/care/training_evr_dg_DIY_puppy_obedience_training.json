Here are the top three tips for training a puppy that can make puppy training easier for everyone.", "articleBody": "Image via Dora Zett/Shutterstock.com Part of the responsibility of being a new puppy parent is teaching your puppy good manners. These three quick tips for training a puppy will help get you started. 1. Puppy House-Training Constant supervision is key with a new puppy. Keep a close eye on your pup so that when she starts sniffing around\u2014a clear indication that she has to do her &quot;business&quot;\u2014you can quickly bring her outside for a potty trip. Reward your puppy with small dog treats\u00a0immediately after she finishes, and then praise her for a job well done. 2. Responding to Biting Puppies love to bite in play, and doing so is an important step in their development, but puppies need to learn that painful nips aren\u2019t acceptable. When your puppy clamps down on your finger, mark the behavior by saying \u201couch!\u201d and then withdraw your attention for ten seconds. If your puppy continues biting, say \u201couch\u201d to mark the nip, and then walk away. When it comes to puppy training, they often learn more when you withdraw attention when appropriate; they can&#039;t stand losing your attention and affection. 3. Training a Puppy to &quot;Come&quot; Help your puppy learn that running to you is a very good thing by associating the word \u201ccome\u201d with delicious treats. Say \u201ccome\u201d in a happy tone when your pup is standing close by, then reward her with a treat and praise. Add a friend to the game and take turns saying \u201ccome\u201d and then giving your dog a treat. Never reprimand your pup when she returns to you, since you want the puppy to associate &quot;come&quot; with all things good. It helps to always keep some treats on you whenever you venture out with your pup. A pocketful of biscuits is worth a pound of gold for an eager-to-please puppy."}]
