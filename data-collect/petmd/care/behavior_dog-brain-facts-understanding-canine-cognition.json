What is my dog trying to tell me? What do dogs&#039; brains look like? If you&#039;ve ever wanted to understand these dog brain facts, read this article.", "articleBody": "By Helen Anne Travis Dogs are amazing creatures. They\u2019re able to lead blind people through bustling streets, bring errant sheep back to the herd, and can be trained to do everything from fetch a ball to detect cancer. But how exactly do dogs\u2019 minds work? And how do their brains compare to humans\u2019 and other animals\u2019? We sat down with some of the country\u2019s top veterinarians to learn more. Do Dogs Think? \u201cOh my gosh yes,\u201d says Dr. Jill Sackman, a clinician in behavioral medicine and senior medical director of BluePearl Veterinary Partners\u2019 Michigan hospitals. Dr. Sackman has a PhD in molecular and cellular biology. \u201cThey probably have the level of cognition of a three to five-year-old human.\u201d Dogs can tell we\u2019re trying to show them something when we point at an object. They can evaluate whether one dog bowl has more dog food than another. They respond to familiar voices, and are excellent at determining whether someone is friend or foe. Many dog owners will say it\u2019s the dog who has them trained to be fed and let out at the same time everyday. Obviously something is going on in their furry heads. They\u2019re capable of making associations and reacting to stimuli. But what they think about, and how they interpret the information, is still a mystery. \u201cJust as it\u2019s impossible to read another person\u2019s thoughts, it is impossible to speculate exactly what a dog is thinking,\u201d says Dr. Rachel Barrack of Animal Acupuncture in New York City. What Does A Dog\u2019s Brain Look Like? All mammals have similar brain structures, says Dr. JP McCue, a board-certified veterinary neurologist at NYC&#039;s Animal Medical Center. The hemispheres, lobes and parts of the brain have the same names and the same basic functions. But in dogs, the parts of the brain associated with smell show they have incredibly sensitive noses. More so than other companion animals like cats and ferrets. \u201cThey use a much larger portion of their brains for analyzing smells,\u201d says Barrack. \u201cIt is also presumed that dogs associate scent with memories, which is why they can be trained to sniff for bombs and drugs.\u201d How Do Dog Brains Differ From Human Brains? Not by much. In addition to being structurally similar, MRI studies have shown that the same sections of our brains light up when we\u2019re exposed to various stimuli, says McCue. Man processes fear, memories and spatial awareness in the same way as his best friend. Scientists have also suggested that certain cognitive skills are clumped together, just like in human brains. (For example: if you\u2019re good at math, you\u2019re likely good at problem solving.) \u201cWe\u2019re finding the same is true with dogs,\u201d says Sackman. \u201cCertain skill sets come together. A dog that is fast and accurate in one task has the capacity to be fast and accurate in another task. That would lead us to believe that the heritability of intelligence and cognition is in some degree similar in dogs as it is in people.\u201d Like humans, older dogs have a propensity to develop a condition that is similar to Alzheimer&#039;s disease. Because of the semblances between their brains and ours, dogs are used to evaluate the impact of nutrition and drugs on the brain\u2019s aging process, says Dr. Sackman. But we\u2019re not exactly alike. Dogs\u2019 brains are smaller than ours when compared to overall body size. Our brains have more folds, meaning more surface area. And our prefrontal cortex\u2014where higher level processing and thoughts occur\u2014is more developed than dogs\u2019, says McCue. Can Dogs Understand Humans? One of the theories explaining why dog and human brains have so many similarities is that we evolved together. Dogs are the oldest domesticated species. They\u2019ve been interacting with people for millennia, and as a result, have learned how to understand and communicate with us better than any other species. Their strong sense of observation allows them to pick up hints in our body language, smells and the tones of our voices. \u201cI think people react to those types of signals on a subconscious level, but dogs react to them on a conscious level,\u201d says McCue. One possible story goes something like this. Dogs followed us into our first cities and camps to take advantage of the food waiting for them in our early garbage piles. Those that were less fearful of humans were rewarded with more food. And those that could pick up on human signals\u2014like pointing, and being told to stay and sit\u2014were given even more. Dogs returned the favor by helping early humans with hunting, and protecting them from other wild animals. \u201cSome [papers] I\u2019ve read say humans have been able to evolve and survive because of our partnerships with dogs,\u201d says Sackman. Do Dogs Have Feelings? \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d says McCue. Dogs process sensation and emotion much like we do. Studies have shown they\u2019re capable of feeling optimism, anxiety, happiness, fear and depression. They get jealous when another dog gets a bigger reward for the same behavior, and their brains respond to dog anxiety medication\u00a0like Prozac. There is also evidence that dogs who experience traumatic events experience symptoms of PTSD, just like humans. When observed in an MRI, dogs\u2019 brains react similarly to humans\u2019 when exposed to emotional stimuli like the sound of a baby crying. They also experience pain like we do. \u201cPain is something we experience emotionally, it\u2019s not just a prick on the finger,\u201d says McCue. What Is My Dog Trying To Tell Me? Dogs can certainly understand us. But do they also try to talk back? Veterinarians say yes. \u201cDogs don\u2019t have words,\u201d says Sackman. \u201cThey communicate through body language and they make sounds that give us a wealth of information about what they\u2019re thinking.\u201d A dog turning her head away or licking her lips is telling us she\u2019s nervous, says Sackman. If we humans respond with a hug, we\u2019re acting like primates. Primates hug; dogs don\u2019t. \u201cA lot of dogs don\u2019t like it,\u201d Sackman says. There\u2019s still a lot to learn about canine cognition. Scientists are constantly developing new ways to study dogs\u2019 brains. But MRIs and research papers can only tell us so much. \u201cUntil dogs can find a way to talk to us, there\u2019s a lot we won&#039;t know,\u201d says Sackman."}]
