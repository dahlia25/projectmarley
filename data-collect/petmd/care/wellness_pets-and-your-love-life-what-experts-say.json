Take a few lessons from your pet. That\u2019s the advice of Dr. Tiffany Margolin, DVM and author of &quot;Relationship Reset: Get Her To Love You As Much As Your Dog Does.&quot; Pets can teach us everything from how to greet our partners when they come home after a long day, the importance of turning off the television and spending quality time with our partners, and even how to end a fight gracefully, she says. Then there\u2019s the art of the agenda-less soft touch. You know how a cat pushes against your hand when you rub her cheek? We humans have the same response to a soft touch, explains Margolin. \u201cThere are a lot of relationship subtleties you can learn from having a pet.\u201d Learning To Care For Others For many people, having a pet is how we learn to take care of something other than ourselves, says Dr. Laurie Hess, a board certified avian veterinarian and owner of the Veterinary Center for Birds and Exotics in Bedford Hills, New York. Pets teach us how to bond and how to love; from them we learn the art of reading body language and moods, she says. All of these are very important traits to pay attention to in a romantic partner. \u201cAnimals teach you intuition,\u201d says Margolin. They also teach us patience. \u201cYou have to be patient,\u201d she adds. \u201cThat puppy will [sometimes] pee on the carpet 50 times before it learns.\u201d Pets may make us better people, but does that come across loud and clear to our potential partners? Experts say the answer is yes. And to understand why, you have to go back in time to the early 19th century. Keeping Up With The 1800s Joneses People first started having pets, in the modern sense of the word, in the early 1800s, says Dr. Diana Ahmad, University of Missouri curators\u2019 distinguished teaching professor and author of the book \u201cSuccess Depends on the Animals: Emigrants, Livestock, and Wild Animals on the Overland Trails, 1840-1869.\u201d A few interesting things led to this pet phenomenon, she explains. Middle and upper class people finally had the means to take care of animals they didn\u2019t plan to eat. The large number of people traveling west at that period were keen to bring along a dog for protection, or a cat that reminded them of the family they\u2019d never see again (remember, there was no Skype or email back then). Finally, a series of books by authors like Charlotte Elizabeth Tonna and Lydia Maria Child suggested that how we treat animals reflected on our family\u2019s social status. \u201cIt was a \u2018keeping up with the Joneses\u2019 thing,\u201d Ahmad. In today\u2019s world, our pets still tell other people a lot about our personalities and potential to be good partners. Having a well cared for pet tells romantic interests we\u2019re likely a nurturing person capable of making a commitment, says Margolin. It shows people we can take responsibility for someone other than ourselves. So go ahead, put that funny photo of you and your pet in your dating profile, the experts say. \u201cIf your pet is a big part of your life, you need to share that with people,\u201d says Hess. \u201cYou don\u2019t want something like that to be a surprise.\u201d Think about it this way, says Margolin, if your pets are important to you, and you\u2019re looking for a big-hearted person who accepts that, you can use that photo of you and your pet as a filter of sorts. If a potential partner isn\u2019t willing to accept you for the pet-lover you are, \u201cMaybe they&#039;re not someone you want to be with,\u201d she says. What About Platonic Partners? Even if we\u2019re not looking for love, pets can help us meet new friends and bond over a shared interest, says Hess. Just think of all the dog-walking groups, bird clubs, and rabbit societies out there. \u201cHaving a pet fosters a sense of community,\u201d she says. And a common interest in pets can be a great social lubricant. We can also learn a thing or two about making new human friends from the way we interact with animals. Remember the last time you saw someone walking a friendly-looking dog on the street, says Margolin. Didn\u2019t you just want to run over and pet it? Imagine if you applied that same enthusiasm to greeting a stranger, she says, minus the petting, perhaps. Go at it with no preconceived notions or prejudices. Why not wag your tail and see how the conversation unfolds?"}]
