Find out what causes some dogs to bark more than others.", "articleBody": "Why do some dogs bark more than others? Maybe your neighbor\u2019s dog barks nonstop when he\u2019s gone, or maybe your dog barks at every breeze, shadow or whisper. And then there are dogs that hardly ever make a peep. You might love your dog unconditionally, but a dog that barks at everything and anything can get a bit exhausting. No one enjoys being jarred out of sleep to the cacophonous sound of dog barking in the middle of the night\u2014especially when there seems to be no reason for it. So, what causes one dog to bark more than the others? Here are three factors that could contribute to a noisy household. Genetics and Breed-Specific Characteristics Genetics and breeding for specific traits can play a big role in a dog\u2019s proclivity for barking. According to Dr. Stefanie Schwartz, a board-certified veterinary behaviorist based in Orange County, California, the frequency of a dog\u2019s bark can vary from breed to breed, and it all depends on how their ancestors were bred. \u201cBarking was emphasized in some breeds more than others,\u201d says Dr. Schwartz. She explains that this trait was likely\u00a0\u201cselected by our ancestors to help guard human settlements.\u201d Not all breeds known for barking will necessary be noisy, however. For instance, terriers tend to be more vocal. But not all terriers will bark excessively, says Dr. Schwartz. Huskies and Nordic breeds are also known to howl more than others, while most Basenjis don\u2019t bark at all, says Dr. Schwartz. Environmental Factors Dogs get used to their environments, and they will react to sounds that are unexpected (like a knock at the door) and those that they don&#039;t hear often.\u00a0 If a dog was raised in a bustling city where they\u2019re used to hearing constant noise, they\u2019ll probably be less apt to bark in a noisy urban environment. But a dog who was raised in a quiet, rural area may bark at any sound. \u201cA city dog wouldn&#039;t react to a siren (cops, ambulance) because it becomes part of the background noise, compared to a country dog [who lives] where things are quieter and less chaotic,&quot;\u00a0says Dr. Schwartz. Unintentional Rewarding of Dog Barking \u201cSome dogs learn to bark for attention regardless of breed,\u201d says Dr. Schwartz. \u201cBarking is a response to not getting their needs met.\u201d She also says that, \u201cBarking can be a learned behavior where the dog signals to the owner, \u2018I need something.\u2019\u201d \u201cIt goes back to that basic of rewarding behavior,\u201d says Dr. Katie Malehorn, DVM a staff veterinarian at Friendship Hospital for Animals in Washington, D.C. She explains that dogs will keep doing something if they are getting rewarded for it. Many owners may pay more attention to the dog when he\u2019s barking\u2014accidentally rewarding him for the behavior, says Khara Schuetzner, a certified professional dog trainer and owner of The Doggie Spot based in Shawnee, Oklahoma. Dr. Schwartz gave the example of one woman who gave her dog a treat every time he barked\u2014giving him attention and fulfilling his need for food\u2014and inadvertently training him to bark. What You Can Do to Stop Dogs From Barking So Much To help lessen your dog\u2019s barking, figure out the root cause of the behavior. Dr. Schwartz explains that you need to find out what the triggers are for dog barking. Once you figure out the triggering behavior, the best approach is to work with a dog trainer and veterinarian (or a veterinary behaviorist) to find the best ways to help your dog find alternative, more productive behaviors. Dr. Malehorn says that you will need to be patient. Many dog owners won\u2019t seek help or try to work on excessive barking until it becomes a serious issue. At this point, it is going to take time, consistency and a good training plan to break the habit. By: Teresa K. Traverse Featured Image: iStock.com/srugina"}]
