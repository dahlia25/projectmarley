You need to keep your dog calm, make sure he has food and water, manage any motion sickness, stop regularly for potty breaks\u00a0and get him settled in your destination without too much disruption or anxiety. Another major source of concern for pet owners when traveling with dogs is safety. That\u2019s because car safety features are designed for the weight and body position of humans\u2014not pets. This puts dogs at risk of serious head, neck, and back trauma in a high-speed crash, rollover\u00a0or other vehicular accident, says Dr. Michael Lund of the ASPCA. Additionally, dogs who aren\u2019t properly restrained pose great risks to human passengers in the event of a sudden stop, swerve\u00a0or accident. \u201cIn the event of a crash at 50 mph, a 10-pound, unrestrained dog generates 500 pounds of projectile force,\u201d says Melanie Monteiro, a dog safety coach and author of \u201cThe Safe Dog Handbook: A Complete Guide to Protecting Your Pooch Indoors &amp; Out.\u201d \u201cIn a 30-mph crash, an 80-pound dog would become a 2,400-pound flying projectile.\u201d That\u2019s where things like a dog seat belt, dog kennel and\u00a0dog car seat\u00a0come in handy. Here\u2019s important information about all of these products, as well as some tips on how to find the safest dog car seat or\u00a0dog car seat belt\u00a0for traveling in the car with your dog. Do Dog Seat Belts Work? In case you\u2019re unfamiliar with them, dog car seat belts attach a full-body dog harness to a strap with a buckle that fits in the regular seat belt device of a vehicle, Lund says. In the event of an accident or sudden change of speed, the harness should spread out the pulling force of a leash along your dog\u2019s chest and back, minimizing force along the neck. Dog seat belts, Lund says, are best for larger dogs. When applying them, the straps that buckle into the dog car harness should be long enough that the dog is comfortable, though short enough to prevent him from crashing into the seat in front of him in the event of an accident. What About Dog Car Seats? While a dog seat belt harness\u00a0is\u00a0great for large dogs, dog car seats are ideal for small and medium dogs, Lund says. \u201cThey are often designed as a comfortable dog bed held in place by the vehicle\u2019s seat belt, similar to a car seat for a child,\u201d he says. They also should include a full-body harness that prevents significant movement during accidents and speed changes. Should You Crate a Dog While Driving? \u201cThe priority is keeping the animal inside the vehicle, but preventing trauma within the vehicle is also important,\u201d Lund says. The best way to do this is to keep your dog in a kennel while he travels in the car. It\u2019s also the most effective way of preventing your dog from distracting you while you\u2019re driving, and in the event of a serious accident, there\u2019s less of a risk of the dog fleeing the scene in panic, which can result in him getting lost or hit by another vehicle. \u201cKenneled dogs involved in high-speed car accidents have a higher likelihood of surviving with fewer injuries,\u201d Lund adds. The downside, however, is that the dog isn\u2019t directly restrained, which means he could get injured after crashing hard into the kennel itself. Dog Car Seats and Seat Belts: Choosing the Best Option \u201cYou want to find the best solution for your dog, family, and vehicle type \u201d Monteiro says. &quot;Like children, the safest place for a dog is to be buckled in the backseat\u2014but if your backseat is full of human passengers, there are now some great options for the cargo area.&quot; She recommends visiting the Center for Pet Safety to look over its reviews of the crash-worthiness of various pet restraints, so you can find the safest dog car seat or dog seat belt for your pup. \u201cThey test a wide range of travel harnesses, carriers\u00a0and crates, using specially weighted crash-test-dummy dogs,\u201d she says. \u200bThe products that meet their standards for approval will be marked with the \u201cCenter for Pet Safety Certified\u201d logo. Other Dog Car Safety Tips to Follow &quot;Never leave your dog alone in the car, even with the windows cracked,\u201d Monteiro says. \u200b&quot;Even on a day as mild as 72 degrees, your car&#039;s internal temperature can rise over 40 degrees in under an hour. Extreme cold weather can also be dangerous. It&#039;s just not worth the risk.&quot; Distractions are another major problem, Monteiro says. Here, restraints are extremely helpful because they will keep your dog from moving around the vehicle or climbing onto your lap. But, as a driver, you should also exercise some self-restraint by keeping your eyes on the road and not on your dog. Monteiro also recommends keeping a canine safety kit\u2014including a blanket or towel, spare dog collar and leash, dog poop bags, water and dish, dog toys, dog\u00a0treats, an extra meal, and a dog first aid kit\u2014in your car whenever he\u2019s riding with you. \u201cThis helps you be prepared for a change of plans, an unexpected problem\u00a0or a spontaneous adventure.\u201d"}]
