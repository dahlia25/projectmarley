Discover what your dog&#039;s nose is capable of with these interesting facts.", "articleBody": "Your pup\u2019s nose is a powerful device that guides him through his days in some pretty impressive ways. \u201cDogs noses are specifically adapted to function much better than ours,\u201d explains Dr. Michael T. Nappier, DVM, DABVP, of the Virginia Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine.\u00a0 \u201cThey have up to 300 million\u00a0olfactory\u00a0receptors in their noses, versus only about 6 million for us. And the part of their brain dedicated to interpreting these is about 40 times larger than ours,\u201d says Dr. Nappier. Facts About Your Dog\u2019s Nose and Amazing Sense of Smell Here are eight more interesting facts about your dog\u2019s sense of smell that prove that canines have superior noses. 1.\u00a0A dog\u2019s nose has two functions\u2014smelling and breathing.\u00a0 According to Dr. Nappier, a canine\u2019s nose has the ability to separate air. A portion goes directly to the olfactory sensing area (which distinguishes scents), while the other portion is dedicated to breathing. 2.\u00a0Dogs have the ability to breathe in and out at the same time.\u00a0 \u201cWhen sniffing, dogs\u2019 noses are designed so that air can move in and out at the same time, creating a continuous circulation of air, unlike humans who have to either breathe in or out only,\u201d says Dr. Nappier. 3.\u00a0Dogs have a special organ that gives them a \u201csecond\u201d sense of smell.\u00a0 According to Dr. Nappier, a dog\u2019s vomeronasal organ helps them detect\u00a0pheromones, which are chemicals that animals release that affect other members of the same species. This organ plays an important role in reproduction and other aspects of canine\u00a0physiology\u00a0and behavior. 4.\u00a0Dogs smell in 3-D.\u00a0 Dogs can smell separately with each nostril. Just as our eyes compile two slightly different views of the world, and our brain combines them to form a 3-D picture, a dog\u2019s brain uses the different odor profiles from each nostril to determine exactly where smelly objects are located. 5.\u00a0Dogs can smell the passage of time.\u00a0 Dogs can detect the tiny reductions in the concentrations of odor molecules that occur over short periods of time. This allows tracking dogs to quickly determine which direction a person or animal has gone in by\u00a0sniffing the ground. 6. Dogs&#039;\u00a0noses have\u00a0evolved to help them survive.\u00a0 According to Dr. David C. Dorman, DVM, PhD, DABVT, DABT, professor of toxicology at North Carolina State College of Veterinary Medicine, dogs have used their noses to assist with major life events since the beginning of time.\u00a0 \u201cEvolutionarily, a dog\u2019s sense of smell helps them find a mate,\u00a0offspring, and food, and avoid predators,\u201d he says. 7.\u00a0Dogs can smell up to 100,000 times better than humans.\u00a0 Dr. Nappier puts this tidbit into perspective with an awe-inspiring analogy. \u201cA dog&#039;s sense of smell is its most powerful sense,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is so sensitive that [dogs can] detect the equivalent of a 1/2 a teaspoon of sugar in an Olympic-sized swimming pool.\u201d 8.\u00a0Some breeds have a better sense of smell than others. While all dogs have strong sniffers, Dr. Nappier says, \u201chound breed dogs have the best sense of smell.\u201d Dr. Dorman points out that sturdy working dogs like\u00a0German Shepherds\u00a0and\u00a0Labradors\u00a0also rank high in their smelling abilities. Some dogs, like\u00a0Pugs, that have short faces (also known as\u00a0brachycephalic\u00a0dogs), may \u201chave some airway compromise that could affect their sense of smell,\u201d explains Dr. Nappier.\u00a0 Featured Image: iStock.com/\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0424\u0438\u0441\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e"}]
