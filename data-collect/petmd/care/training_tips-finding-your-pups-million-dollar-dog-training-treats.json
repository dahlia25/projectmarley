Beyond simple cues like sit, stay and roll over, a well-trained dog knows how to behave around unfamiliar people, pets and environments. Positive reinforcement is key during the dog training process, and many pet owners use dog treats\u00a0to reinforce desired behaviors and responses in their pups. But with a seemingly endless variety of dog treats available, how can you narrow down your options to find the best dog training treats\u00a0for your dog? How Do Treats Impact Training? In the most basic terms, in positive reinforcement training, dog treats act as the reward for good behavior. \u201cWhen training a dog, this reward can be anything that the learner deems valuable. We trainers like food because most dogs find food extremely valuable, and it fits right in our pockets,\u201d says Molly Sumridge, a certified professional dog trainer and behavior consultant. Sumridge owns Kindred Companions LLC, a dog training company in Frenchtown, New Jersey. Some dogs are highly food-motivated and will respond to basic dog food\u00a0kibble, but as behaviors become more complex and training becomes more demanding, it may be necessary to up the quality of the dog training treat. Dr. Carlo Siracusa, DVM, PhD, MS, a clinical assistant professor of behavior medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine in Philadelphia, says that as a dog\u2019s environment become more stimulating, the value of the dog training treats must increase to maintain his or her attention. \u201cAs a general rule, the more hectic the environment, the better the value of the treat has to be. You need a treat that will hold the dog\u2019s attention and keep him focused on the training exercise,\u201d Dr. Siracusa explains. So, dog treats seem to be a must for positive dog training, but how do you find the best ones? What Makes a Good Dog Training Treat? Generally speaking, any dog treat your canine responds to is a good training treat, but Sumridge and Dr. Siracusa have a few guidelines that humans should follow when seeking the perfect training treat. \u201cTraining treats should be soft and small\u2014the size of a pencil eraser, or even half that. You also want them to be quick to eat, so avoid foods like dog biscuits that take time to chew through,\u201d Sumridge says. She adds that training treats should be small, regardless of the size of the dog. \u201cWe don\u2019t give bigger treats to bigger dogs. All dogs get little tastes,\u201d she says. Dr. Siracusa notes that food with a strong aroma makes a good training treat, as the scent will grab a dog\u2019s attention. \u201cThis is why cheese is usually so effective. Even a tiny piece will leave a smell on your hands, which can be very motivating for your dog.\u201d Beyond cheese, Dr. Siracusa also recommends Cat-Man-Doo dried bonito flakes cat and dog treats. \u201cThey\u2019re really small, but really smelly. They grab a pet\u2019s attention without having a significant impact on overall diet.\u201d Both Sumridge and Dr. Siracusa agree that dog owners should try to balance treats with a dog\u2019s overall diet so that the dog doesn\u2019t gain weight. According to Sumridge, the best way to ensure that treats don\u2019t impact your dog\u2019s waistline is to stick to real meat treats. These could include chicken you cook up yourself, deli meats, freeze-dried dog food\u00a0or treats like PureBites chicken breast freeze-dried dog treats or Halo Liv-a-Littles grain-free 100 percent wild salmon freeze-dried dog and cat treats. \u201cThe caloric intake for real meat treats is going to be much lower than the processed food, just like for humans,\u201d she explains. For everyday training or overweight dogs, a good rule of thumb is to use healthy treats such as slices of apples or baby carrots to lessen calorie intake. Finding the Best Training Treat for Your Dog Knowing what makes a good dog training treat is useful, but there\u2019s still the step of figuring out what works best for your dog. This is just trial and error. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of figuring out which your dog likes best,\u201d says Sumridge. It is important to use one type of training treat for a few days and monitor for any gastrointestinal signs. If your dog does well with that one type, then you can start adding newer/or higher value treats, one by one.\u00a0 Dr. Siracusa adds, \u201cYour dog is going to tell you which treats he likes best. Those are the treats he\u2019ll perform for. They won\u2019t do the work if they don\u2019t want the reward.\u201d"}]
