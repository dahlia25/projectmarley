Summertime means fun, sun, and lots of play outdoors if you\u2019re a dog -- or a dog owner, for that matter.\u00a0But as much fun as summer can be for you and your dog, there are a few safety tips that will hopefully make the warmest of all seasons safe and carefree for all concerned. Slip, slop, slap As the Australian mantra is known to all Down Under, it means slip on a shirt, slop on some sunscreen, and slap on a hat. This technique can be applied to your dog as well, especially if he\u2019s of a short-haired variety. Dress your dog in a shirt, put pet-safe sunscreen on his ears and nose, and if you can&#039;t get him to put on a hat, keep him in the shade often -- this will help prevent cases of sunburn or even heatstroke in your pup. Heatstroke Not a fun summer activity for anyone, especially your dog. Nip this potential summer dampener in the butt and give Rover access to shade and lots of water. A pair of cool shades wouldn&#039;t hurt either. Signs of heatstroke include excessive panting, drooling, rapid pulse, and fever. Grassy Knolls Dogs love to run and play on grassy areas. But make sure you keep your pup in the designated \u201cdoggy areas,\u201d because fertilizers may be used in non-dog areas, which are harmful to your pooch. A safe bet is taking Fido to your favorite dog park. Remember, not all grass is created equal. Beware Christine&#039;s Wrath Actually, we can\u2019t quite remember if Stephen King\u2019s old classic, Christine, was about a demon car or a killer car, but it doesn\u2019t matter. Point is, don\u2019t leave Rover in the car during the hot summer months -- or at any time, for that matter. Not even if you\u2019re going into the store for only a few minutes. The heat in a car can quickly rise to lethal levels. So, either take him with you or leave him at home when you go shopping. The Antifreeze Situation Antifreeze is something to watch out for year \u2018round. Dogs find it delicious and even in very small amounts it\u2019s very poisonous. But cars tend to overheat more and leak antifreeze during the summer, so be on the watch when walking your dog. Dogs With Nautical-Themed Pashmina Afghans If your dog is on a boat, as The Lonely Island&#039;s hit song would say, then he&#039;d better know how to swim (that&#039;s right, not all dogs know how to swim). And even if your pooch can swim, a doggy life vest is a must. After all, rip currents are a killer, even for dogs with the best swimming abilities. You never know when accidents will happen while sailing on the high seas. A few more pointers. You should definitely make sure the doggy\u2019s ID and registration is up to date. Fido might get over-excited and take off, but at least you\u2019ll be able to track him down. And in the really hot days of summer, take him for a walk when it\u2019s cooler -- early evening or early morning is best. Last of all, make sure you\u2019re up to date with flea and tick meds -- this is the season where they come out in droves. So, forget easy going. Summertime for you and your pooch should be plain ol\u2019 easy. Image: Claudio Gennari / via Flickr"}]
