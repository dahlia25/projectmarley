These 10 breeds are low-shedding, have hypoallergenic coats, and require minimal grooming. Find out what dog breeds made our list.", "articleBody": "What are the \u201ccleanest\u201d dog breeds? A lot of prospective dog owners with tidy homes would like to know. Unfortunately, the term \u201cclean\u201d is relative, and might apply to dogs that have little discernable doggy odor or dogs that groom themselves like cats. Or perhaps \u201cclean\u201d means dogs with low-shedding, hypoallergenic coats, or even dogs with no coat at all. Keeping these factors in mind, here are the top ten breeds we\u2019ve determined to be the cleanest. The first hairless breed to originate in the United States, the American Hairless Terrier was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 2016. The new breed is the result of a mutation that occurred in a litter of Rat Terriers born in 1972, according to the AKC. The litter included a hairless, pink-skinned puppy with black spots that was playful, affectionate and feisty. In time, the American Hairless Terrier breed was established and has become a popular dog with families. As terriers, they also love to play outside, dig in the dirt and chase anything that moves. \u00a0 The American Hairless Terrier does shed skin cells and their sensitive skin must be protected from sunburn with sunscreen or protective clothing. Because the dogs are hairless, they don\u2019t shed but are more prone to skin problems. \u201cWhile they\u2019re clean and neat, they can have the same skin issues people do,\u201d says AKC Vice President Gina DiNardo.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Recognized by the AKC in 2010, the Xoloitzcuintli can be either hairless or have a short coat. An ancient breed native to Mexico, its name comes from the Aztec god Xolotl and itzcuintli, the Aztec word for dog. \u00a0 The typical Xoloitzcuintli, or Xolo for short, is calm, aloof and attentive, and makes an excellent companion dog with moderate exercise and grooming needs. Xolos require occasional baths, after which the hairless version should receive an application of body lotion.\u00a0 \u00a0 Learn more about the Xoloitzcuintli.\u00a0 If \u201cclean\u201d is defined strictly in terms of a low-shedding coat, the gentle and loyal Bedlington Terrier fits the bill. This unique-looking breed that vaguely resembles a sheep doesn\u2019t shed, but its single-layer coat should be regularly clipped. The AKC recommends going to an experienced groomer to keep the Bedlington Terrier\u2019s coat in top form. \u00a0 Learn more about the Bedlington Terrier.\u00a0 Well known as a good choice for people with allergies because of its non-shedding, hypoallergenic coat, the Poodle was recognized by the AKC in 1887 and comes in three sizes\u2014toy, miniature and standard. The Poodle is a highly intelligent, active and family-friendly breed. \u00a0 The Poodle\u2019s coat is so sought-after that the breed is one of the most popular to cross with other breeds, spawning oodles of Poodle hybrids including the Cockapoo (Cocker Spaniel/Poodle), Goldendoodle (Golden Retriever/Poodle), Jack-a-Poo (Jack Russell Terrier/Poodle), Labradoodle (Labrador Retriever/Poodle), and Pekepoo (Pekingese/Poodle). Of course, even breeds with low-maintenance coats still require regular grooming. \u00a0 Learn more about Poodles.\u00a0 The Chow Chow combines many \u201cclean\u201d dog characteristics, and according to the AKC, owners report that Chow Chows \u201care the cleanest of dogs: they housebreak easily, have very little doggy odor, and generally are as fastidious as cats.\u201d At certain times of the year, however, Chow Chows shed\u2026 a lot! \u00a0 An adaptable breed that requires only moderate exercise and can easily live in an apartment setting, adjectives used to describe the Chow Chow\u2019s personality include \u201cdignified\u201d and \u201cserious-minded.\u201d \u00a0 The Chow Chow originated in ancient China where it was used as a hunting dog. The medium-sized dog is also known as one of only two breeds with a blue-black tongue. The AKC also notes that Martha Stewart owns several Chow Chows.

Japanese Chins particularly like to lick their paws to clean them, not just to remove an irritation or soothe a wound like other dog breeds, she says. \u00a0 Sensitive and highly intelligent, the Japanese Chin was bred to be a companion animal. It\u2019s name, however, is a misnomer, as it originated in ancient China and not Japan. The small, medium-energy breed has a long, silky coat that\u2019s surprisingly low-maintenance. The Japanese Chin also tends to be a quiet housemate, but agile and playful when it wants to be, much like a cat. \u00a0 Learn more about the Japanese Chin.\u00a0 Cat-like in its aloofness around strangers and self-grooming habits, the Basenji was developed in Africa and is known for its curled tail and quiet presence. The shorthaired breed usually only requires regular cleaning with a \u201chound glove\u201d or mitt and lacks the typical dog odor. As a hunting breed, the Basenji needs plenty of exercise. \u00a0 Learn more about Basenjis.\u00a0 \u201cClean\u201d might also refer to dogs that are not so high-energy and easily bored that their favorite pastime is wrecking the house. \u00a0 The Greyhound is the fastest breed of dog that\u2019s active outdoors but is something of a couch potato indoors. As long as his need for regular exercise and fenced-in running room are met, the Greyhound is quite docile at home. \u201cGreyhounds are generally very tidy and neat,\u201d DiNardo says. \u00a0 Learn more about Greyhounds.\u00a0 Another tidy breed, Whippets are known for the long, lean bodies and speed as a hunting dog. Because of their short, fine coats, Whippets generally do not have that distinct doggy odor of some other breeds and can easily adapt to relaxing at home with their families, provided they have time to run during the day. \u00a0 Learn more about Whippets. Similar to the Whippet and Greyhound, this tidy breed is calm and gentle at home and its short coat requires minimal grooming. A medium-sized dog that uses its senses of sight, smell and hearing to hunt, the Pharaoh Hound is a skilled and powerful dog. \u00a0 Learn more about Pharaoh Hounds. In general, dogs that are groomed appropriately, get enough exercise and attention, are trained to mind their manners and are bathed regularly to control the natural oils in their skin that cause odor, can meet most owners\u2019 definition of \u201cclean,\u201d DiNardo says."}]
