Here is a general breakdown of common dog adoption fees.", "articleBody": "How Much Does it Cost to Adopt a Dog? By Jackie Kelly A common question among dog adopters is, &quot;Why are adoption fees so high? Shouldn\u2019t adopting a dog be free, or at least super cheap?&quot; But it\u2019s always important to remember: You get what you pay for. \u201cThe great thing about adoption is that the shelters do a lot of the work up front,\u201d says Gail Buchwald, senior vice president at ASPCA Adoption Center. \u201cEverything from vaccinations and medical treatment to behavior assessments and spay and neuter services are already taken care of. We also send animals home with collars, leashes, engraved tags, carriers, and many more of the basics an owner needs to get their dog settled at a new home.\u201d Fees are often adjusted based on the age of the dog, but here is a breakdown of what a good shelter has already put into your dog before you adopt. Spay, Neuter, and Other Medical Services \u201cIn a private practice setting, dog spays and neuters can range from $200 to $800,\u201d says Dr. Kate Gollon, shelter and community veterinarian for the Animal Rescue League of Boston. That price varies depending on the size of the dog, sex, age, and geographic location, but Gollon says it can often be more than the total cost\u2014between $200 and $450\u2014of all adoption fees, which makes adopting a noticeably less expensive option. Gollon says all dogs (as well as cats and rabbits) are spayed or neutered before they\u2019re adopted. Among the other medical services covered by the overall cost of adoption, Gollon says, are a full veterinary exam, vaccines (including ones that cover distemper, parvo, rabies and kennel cough, assuming the dog is old enough), heartworm test, intestinal dewormer, and flea and tick treatment. Some dogs, but not all, may also receive blood work, X-rays, and/or dental work, depending on their condition when they arrive at the shelter. Microchips Not all shelters microchip dogs before they\u2019re adopted, but good ones do. Although a lot of pet owners insist that their adopted dog will never get lost, shelters see it happen all the time\u2014whether it be because of a natural disaster or an unfortunate accident. Buchwald says it will cost you approximately $40 plus an exam visit fee if you microchip through a veterinary clinic. If you adopt from a shelter that makes microchipping mandatory, it\u2019s built into the adoption cost and ultimately sets the shelter back about $20. Food, Shelter, and Comfort The cost to feed a dog for a month in an animal shelter can vary greatly based on the resources of the shelter, but a general ballpark estimate is approximately $40 to $60. This does not include special diets for dogs who need weight loss food or dog food for other specific health needs. Then there are toys, treats, bedding, and other necessities that the shelter provides. \u00a0 Extras Buchwald says you will need to pay two fees before adopting\u2014an adoption fee and a dog license fee. Both vary depending on the dog in question, the facility from which you\u2019re adopting, and the location of the shelter , but she says the adoption fee is generally between $75 and $200, while the dog license fee is roughly $10. She adds that the ASPCA and other similar organizations occasionally have special days on which some or all of these fees are waived. Some animal shelters will provide you with a bag of food to go home with so you can slowly adjust your new dog to the brand you\u2019ve chosen to feed him. Collars, ID tags, and leashes may also be worked into the adoption fees. If you\u2019ve adopted a puppy or a dog who was transferred from one region or shelter to another, the cost for the transportation might be added into your dog adoption fee. Carolyn Curran, shelter manager for the Animal Rescue League of Boston, says her shelter (and others) provide some of these extras in exchange for a suggested donation. \u201cFor instance, we recommend crating a new dog in your home, but we don\u2019t require that,\u201d she says, \u201cso we can give adopters a crate, if they\u2019d like, for a suggested donation.\u201d Remember that most of these nonprofit organizations do not receive federal or state funding. The dog adoption fees make caring for the animals in the shelter possible. More often than not, the regular day-to-day operations, the cost for animal shelter agents, veterinary staff, etc., gets paid for by the shelter\u2019s ability to fundraise and acquire donations to keep themselves afloat rather than just through adoption fees for animals. Additionally, most adoption centers will explain what their adoption fees include. Post-Adoption Costs Finally, there are the things you need to account for once you have your dog home. While they\u2019re not exactly fees associated with the actual adoption process, they\u2019re still costs you need to account for when you\u2019re bringing home a new dog. Curran says all new dogs should have a wellness visit with a vet within the first few weeks of the adoption. \u201cThe animals who come in here and are adopted are all seen by a vet, but it\u2019s important for new owners to establish a relationship with their own vet early,\u201d she says. \u201cIf your puppy has a funny rash three months after adoption, you\u2019ll want to know that you have somewhere to go.\u201d You may also need to seek out the services of a trainer or behaviorist, if your dog is having a hard time adjusting. Curran says her shelter\u2019s dogs are monitored closely for things like resource guarding, and while they note any problematic behavior with a prospective adopter early in the process, some dogs\u2019 behavior might not change until after they go home with a new owner.
