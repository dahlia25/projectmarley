The cause of a pet\u2019s anxiety at the vet is not always clear, but pet parents can take steps to \u201cdesensitize\u201d their pet, according to Victoria Schade, a dog trainer, speaker, and author. Helping your pet stay calm will make vet visits more pleasant\u2014and productive\u2014for all involved. Causes of Fear and Anxiety During Vet Visits Fear of the unknown is a big cause of stress for pets during a vet visit, particularly for cats, says Dr. Cathy Lund of City Kitty, a feline-only veterinary practice in Providence, Rhode Island. \u201cCats are the ultimate control freaks of the animal kingdom. They want everything familiar,\u201d she says. \u201cThe cat carrier, the car, the different smells at the office\u2014these all stress them out.\u201d The nature of vet visits can also stress out your pet, Schade says. \u201cAn exam can be uncomfortable. It\u2019s a unique way of being handled. Plus, it\u2019s not something that happens frequently, so it is going to be met with a little trepidation.\u201d Unfortunately, neither your pet\u2019s breed nor home environment can predict which animal will be anxious, Schade explains. \u201cWithin a household, you can have one dog who is relaxed and one who is a challenge, even with the exact same circumstances.\u201d Another factor that can cause anxiety is the memory of a negative experience. Science has shown that people have a \u201cnegativity bias\u201d\u2014that is, we remember unpleasant events more vividly than pleasant ones. \u201cTherefore, animals who have been traumatized by an experience at the vet are more likely to react badly at future visits,\u201d Schade says. Know When Your Pet Is Stressed When cats are stressed, they will hiss, growl, flatten themselves out, or try to scratch or bite, Lund says. \u201cIt\u2019s defensive behavior\u2014cat language for, \u2018Back off, sucker.\u2019\u201d Dogs, on the other hand, can exhibit a variety of behaviors. \u201cSome shut down, shrinking away, with ears and head down,\u201d Schade describes. \u201cOthers snarl, bite, or try to get away in really dramatic displays of fearfulness.\u201d Get Your Pet Used to Handling Schade and Lund both agree that making your animal comfortable requires time, patience, and a little bit of homework. Start by getting your pet used to body handling at home. Clean their ears, clip their nails, brush their teeth, touch them near the tail or stomach. That way, the vet\u2019s exam won\u2019t feel completely foreign. You can also leave the pet carrier out at home so the animal can explore it, and maybe even lie down in it. \u201cThat way, you are not suddenly bringing it up from the basement and sticking them in it at exam time,\u201d Lund advises. Stop by the Vet for a &#039;Social Visit&#039;\u00a0\u00a0 After you talk to your vet about your plan, stop by just to have the staff pet your animal and give him a treat. \u201cThis is important, with kittens in particular,\u201d Lund says. \u201cWe want to teach them that changes in scenery are OK, that changes in the environment are not stressful.\u201d If that goes well, you can take it a step further the next time. Bring your pet into the exam room and have the tech or veterinarian interact with your pet in a non-clinical manner, like gentle petting that might transition into a brief paw touch or ear stroke, Schade explains. If your pet has had a bad experience at the vet, you will need to slow the process way down. \u201cBreak it down into tiny steps,\u201d Schade says. \u201cMaybe the vet tech just comes to the door of the exam room. Keep a little distance so the dog remains calm. Each time, you bridge that gap.\u201d \u00a0 Create a Stress-Free Environment at the Vet \u00a0 Ask about scheduling your vet visit during less busy times to minimize wait time or the stress of a room full of unfamiliar animals, sounds, and smells. Lund and Schade suggest being casual and matter of fact, speaking calmly and quietly. Dogs in particular key into how their people feel, so your anxiety will feed theirs, Schade points out. Take along familiar items from home, a toy or towel your animal uses, and let him lie or stand on the towel at the vet, Lund suggests. If the animal is relaxed enough, have the vet give him a treat. Ask staff to speak quietly, dim the lights, if possible, and not make sudden moves. \u201cDon\u2019t drag your animal out of the carrier or be rough with the leash,\u201d Lund adds. \u201cIf your pet is very scared, dismantle the carrier so the vet can examine him while he stays put. The biggest thing is recognizing that this is all fear and to just minimize the fear.\u201d\u00a0 Take the Edge Off Before a Vet Visit A particularly stressed-out animal can benefit from anti-anxiety medications; or with felines, a little catnip can take the edge off before a vet visit. But, there is a caveat. In an emergency, you won\u2019t have time to medicate your pet, so the fear and anxiety will be on full display, Schade notes. \u201cA better strategy is to help your pet overcome his fear and anxiety of a visit to the vet,\u201d she says. \u201cWorking through handling anxiety at the vet office takes commitment, but the resulting calm behavior will make life easier for both your pet and your practitioner.\u201d"}]
