Though we can swat these pesky pests away with a hand or a swatter, our dogs are often at their mercy, which can be both frustrating and potentially dangerous to your dog\u2019s health. Fortunately, there are ways to keep flies away from your dog for good. Why do Flies Bite My Dog? Flies can be drawn to a dog\u2019s coat, especially if it is matted or unclean as a result of an illness, skin condition, or diarrhea. \u201cDiarrhea around the perineum attracts flies; they lay eggs, and the infestation happens,\u201d said Dr. Virginia Sinnott, an emergency doctor at Angell Animal Medical Center in Boston. This type of infestation is preventable by keeping an ill dog clean and indoors, she said. Some flies, such as horse flies, can take a bite out of your dog\u2019s ears, belly or backside which can hurt, bleed and become infected. Though these bites are certainly irritating to our pets, flies don\u2019t present the same health risks to dogs that other insects do, Sinnott. \u201cMosquitos are worse, as they bring heartworm disease (especially in the South), which is fatal to dogs and cats.\u201d Flies are particularly active during the day in hot weather, she added, so if they tend to bother your dog, make sure to keep her inside during those times. However, solving any medical issues that may predispose your dog to a fly infestation is most important. How Can I Keep Flies Off My Dog? Keeping your dog clean and healthy will go a long way in keeping flies at bay, but there are other steps you can take to get them off your dog\u2019s back, literally. If flies are targeting a specific area on your dog, say his ears, try applying petroleum jelly to the area to keep them from biting. You can also consider at-home, pet-safe repellants, like a mixture of apple cider vinegar and water or lemon and water, or any number of over-the-counter insect repellants that are as safe for your dog as they are for you. Just be sure to talk to your vet before pursuing any of these remedies, either homemade or store-bought. Home Maintenance Tips for Fighting Flies Still, the best way to keep flies from pestering your pup is to keep them away from your dog\u2019s environment. That means maintaining good hygiene in and around your home, said David Jones, owner of Biotech Pest Controls, an environmentally friendly pest control company in Westerly, R.I. Most flies are scavengers looking for a meal on which to lay eggs that become maggots and create a new generation of flies to start the cycle over, Jones said, so the best and most successful method of getting rid of flies is to remove their food source. Unfortunately, even in the most pristine of homes, an intruding animal (such as a mouse or bird) may die in the attic or cellar and provide a base for flies to reproduce, he added. However, there are some easy and basic steps you can take to keep a home free of flies. Jones recommends cleaning up all waste in your yard (including food or half-chewed dog bones), rinsing and cleaning garbage and recycling bins regularly and making sure your garbage cans don\u2019t overflow. Be sure to also keep your dog\u2019s outdoor food and water dishes clean. In addition to keeping good hygiene, consider other pet-safe steps you can take to get flies to buzz off, such as non-toxic insecticides. Using a spray with the active botanical ingredient Pyrethrum is potent and will quickly kill the various life stages of flies, Jones said. \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by using products containing artificial Pyrethroids and remember any pesticide should be used judiciously and according to the label,\u201d he added. In addition, there are several herbs \u00a0you can plant that not only repel flies but are great kitchen staples. These are basil, bay leaf, mint and rosemary. Other herbs that are nice for people and noxious to flies include lavender, sweet woodruff and tansy. \u201cI think planting any herb or shrub that claims to deter insects can be helpful,\u201d Jones said. \u201cBut their usefulness won\u2019t replace the number one method of using hygiene, especially keeping your yard clean, your compost pile covered and pet food covered.\u201d Your vigilance shouldn\u2019t stop outdoors, either. Sinnott recommends keeping your house clean by clearing all food items off of counters and making sure your windows and doors have screens free of rips or holes."}]
