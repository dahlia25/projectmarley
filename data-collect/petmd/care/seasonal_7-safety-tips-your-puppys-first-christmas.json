But it\u2019s important to remember that puppies are as mischievous as they are adorable. Perhaps more than any other holiday, Christmas brings a host of potential puppy hazards, from toxic foods to dangerous decor. So when you have a new puppy, it\u2019s important to keep safety in mind. Holiday Pet Safety Tips for Your Puppy\u2019s First Christmas 1. Beware of the Bar Whether you\u2019re hosting or taking your puppy to visit friends or family this holiday season, keep an eye on the cocktails. A curious puppy might be tempted to sample a few unattended drinks. \u201cWe\u2019ve noticed that dogs especially seem to like creamy drinks like White Russians, but some pets will readily drink unattended glasses of beer, wine, and other alcoholic drinks if given the opportunity,\u201d says\u00a0Dr. Charlotte Flint, a senior consulting veterinarian with the Pet Poison Helpline, a 24-hour animal poison control service. And it\u2019s not just the drinks you have to worry about. Dr. Flint says, \u201cDuring the holidays, we also run into issues with dogs getting drunk after eating alcohol-soaked desserts, like rum balls.\u201d If\u00a0pets ingest enough alcohol, they can develop symptoms of drunkenness, Dr. Flint says, including: Incoordination Sleepiness Weakness Vomiting Large amounts can cause more dangerous symptoms, such as: Low blood sugar Low body temperature Changes in heart rate, breathing, and blood pressure Tremors Seizures Coma Death So, it\u2019s important to be aware of what your puppy has access to during your holiday celebrations. 2. Keep an Eye on the Buffet Puppies will try to eat anything and everything. Unfortunately, the\u00a0table scraps from the Christmas feast\u00a0contain many potential puppy problems. Be especially careful of the following foods, warns Dr. Flint: Raisins and grapes:\u00a0Traditional holiday treats like fruitcakes, Christmas puddings, and mince pies usually contain raisins, which are extremely toxic to dogs. \u201cRaisin and grape toxicity\u00a0is poorly understood, but can result in\u00a0kidney failure in dogs,\u201d Dr. Flint says. Yeast dough:\u00a0To a puppy\u2019s curious nose, rising dough smells great. Yeast, however, can wreak havoc on the stomach. \u201cWhen ingested, the dough rapidly expands, gas is produced, and dangerous distension of the dog\u2019s stomach can result,\u201d warns Dr. Flint. Sugar-free candy:\u00a0Avoid candy canes and other treats containing\u00a0xylitol, a popular sugar substitute that\u2019s toxic to dogs. If ingested, it can cause low blood sugar and lead to liver failure. Macadamia nuts:\u00a0Macadamia nuts are popular during the holiday season, but they\u2019re toxic to dogs and can cause symptoms ranging from hind-end weakness and tremors to vomiting, diarrhea, and\u00a0pancreatitis. Fatty foods:\u00a0While not truly toxic, consuming fatty foods can cause your puppy to experience vomiting, diarrhea, and pancreatitis. \u201cWe have had cases of dogs who eat pounds of butter left on the counter to soften before holiday baking begins,\u201d says Dr. Flint.If your puppy ingests any of the above holiday foods, contact your veterinarian immediately. Prompt treatment is crucial. 3. Skip the Mistletoe Many pet parents have heard that poinsettias are poisonous to our four-legged friends. However, this is a myth, says Dr. Flint. Ingesting the sap of the poinsettia may cause drooling or GI upset, but not serious symptoms. A more concerning\u00a0holiday plant that is toxic to dogs\u00a0is mistletoe. \u201cLarge ingestions of mistletoe have the potential to cause cardiovascular and possibly neurologic signs,\u201d says Dr. Flint. 4. Provide a Safe Space The holidays are the most hustling, bustling time of the year. While your puppy may enjoy partaking in the fun, he also needs space to decompress. \u201cIf you\u2019re hosting a party, consider the number of guests and amount of noise,\u201d says\u00a0Dr.\u00a0Charlotte\u00a0Means,\u00a0director of toxicology at the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center. \u201cMany pets will benefit from having a safe, secure, and quiet place in the house away from the festivities.\u201d A big pet holiday safety tip is to set up a separate room for your puppy with the essentials: food, water, favorite toys, and a soft bed. You can even play relaxing music or use a white noise machine to provide some background noise and dampen the holiday clamor. It\u2019s also a good idea to crate train your pup before the holidays arrive. 5. Puppy-Proof Your Tree With flashy lights and dangling ornaments,\u00a0Christmas trees\u00a0are extremely interesting to puppies. Dr. Means highlights some of the hazards Christmas trees pose to puppies: Ornaments:\u00a0Antique ornaments may contain lead, and glass ornaments can cause lacerations, including in the digestive tract if ingested. Opt for plastic ornaments and place them higher on the tree, out of your puppy\u2019s reach, says Dr. Means, because they could still cause an obstruction if swallowed. Wires and electric cords:\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s important to prevent your puppy from accessing\u00a0electric cords and extension cords, which can cause electrocution if chewed while plugged in,\u201d says Dr. Means. Chew-proof cord protectors are available and easy to use to keep your puppy safe. Tree water: \u201cBe mindful that your puppy isn\u2019t drinking the water around your Christmas tree,\u201d says Dr. Means. \u201cIf it includes a solution of sugar or fertilizers, it can lead to vomiting and diarrhea.\u201d Even plain water, she notes, can serve as a breeding ground for bacteria and lead to similar symptoms. Tree needles:\u00a0If consumed, tree needles could irritate the mouth and stomach; in large amounts, they could even lead to an\u00a0intestinal obstruction. Sweep needles daily, suggests Dr. Means. 6. Pass on the Potpourri Who on earth would try to eat potpourri? Your puppy, that\u2019s who. A wintry blend may smell nice, but it can also be dangerous. \u201cWhile ingestion of dried potpourri generally causes only mild stomach upset, there is the potential for an obstruction in the stomach if the mixture contains large wood chips or pinecones,\u201d warns Dr. Means. Additionally, some potpourri contains\u00a0toxic plants, she says, and some of the essential oils included in potpourri can be toxic to dogs. 7. Educate Your Guests If you\u2019re entertaining during the holidays, provide your guests with a quick Puppy 101 lesson. \u201cIf your puppy will be interacting with guests, make sure that people know how to properly interact with your pets, including asking your guests not to feed your pets any human food or beverages,\u201d says Dr. Means. Additionally, ask houseguests to properly secure their luggage. Suitcases include all kinds of puppy temptations, from designer shoes to prescription medicines. \u201cHouseguests are often not aware of a pet\u2019s curiosity, and it may not occur to them that they need to keep their medications out of reach of pets, as it is not something they routinely do at their own home,\u201d says Dr. Flint. \u201cDogs will chew up weekly pill organizers or other medication containers, and will eat pills.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0"}]
