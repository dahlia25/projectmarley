Here are some tips on identifying when your dog is hungry and how to keep him feeling full.", "articleBody": "By John Gilpatrick \u00a0 It&#039;s something nearly every dog owner has gone through. Thirty minutes before your alarm goes off, as you cling to those precious last moments of slumber, there&#039;s an overeager and purposeful series of scratches on the bedroom door. Someone&#039;s hungry. \u00a0 But is he really? &quot;Speaking in terms of evolution, dogs are opportunistic scavengers,&quot; says Dr. Rebecca Remillard, a veterinary nutrition consultant and diplomate for the American College of Veterinary Nutrition (ACVN). \u201cIf given the opportunity, they might eat everything in sight including the refrigerator.\u201d \u00a0 Remillard, through her PetDiets.com business, specializes in creating custom, homemade diets for pets. She says actually managing and accurately judging your dog&#039;s satiety (fullness) is a difficult science because dogs eat for many reasons beyond feeling hungry. \u201cJust think about humans,\u201d she says. \u201cFood is love. We eat as a form of community. Conversely, we eat because we\u2019re lonely and stressed, too.\u201d \u00a0 Follow these techniques to better understand when your dog is hungry and what to feed him to keep him full.\u00a0 \u00a0 The first step to measuring how much and what type of food keeps your dog full is to understand his body composition score, Remillard says. Not all dogs are built alike. A 50-pound Great Dane compares very differently to a 50-pound Cocker Spaniel. Odds are your vet has already noted your dog\u2019s body composition score, and if they don\u2019t, it\u2019s simply an observation of weight to expected weight. A score of \u201cone\u201d is severely underweight, while \u201cnine\u201d represents a seriously obese dog. Sometimes vets will use a scale from one to five, rather than one to nine. \u00a0 Remillard notes that all dogs eat differently and one dog might eat differently every day. But what\u2019s important is that score. If he\u2019s between 4-6, or around a 2.5 on a five-point scale, his weight is healthy. That means if your dog is maintaining his body condition score despite not eating everything in his bowl, he\u2019s good, Remillard says. Similarly, if he\u2019s maintaining and still appears to be begging for food, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need it and isn\u2019t even hungry. He\u2019s probably just looking for attention.\u201d \u00a0 Dr. Valerie Parker, assistant professor in the Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences at Ohio State University and an ACVN diplomate, explains that dogs often eat simply because food is tasty and it\u2019s an enjoyable activity for them. \u201cWe as pet owners need to retrain ourselves to not give in when [a dog is] asking for food.\u201d \u00a0 Positive reinforcement and pet/owner bonding take many forms. \u201cPlay with him, take him outside for a walk, brush him,\u201d Parker suggests. \u201cFifteen minutes of quality time will help get his mind off of food.\u201d \u00a0 Some brands of kibble look bigger than others because they\u2019ve been \u201cpopped\u201d\u2014filled with air by using high heat during preparation. This type of food can make your dog feel full, but the feeling dissipates very quickly as your dog expels the air through burps, Remillard says. \u00a0 Foods with high water content are slightly more satisfying, but they\u2019re also satiety placebos as this water simply forces the dog to urinate more. \u00a0 Finding a food that\u2019s high in fiber is key to managing your dog\u2019s appetite. Which leads to\u2026 \u00a0 \u201cFiber is the best nutrient for a dog\u2019s satiety because it can\u2019t be digested,\u201d Remillard explains. \u201cIt just stays with a dog throughout the entire digestive process.\u201d Parker agrees: \u201cFiber is the most crucial ingredient in commercial foods when it comes to gastrointestinal health and satiety.\u201d Indigestible fiber makes a dog feel full while adding no calories to his diet. \u00a0 Remillard warns that it\u2019s not so easy to find a bag of food that\u2019s clearly marked as high in fiber, however. \u201cMarketers have determined that \u2018high-fiber\u2019 food won\u2019t sell quite as well as \u2018lite\u2019 or \u2018light\u2019 dog food,\u201d she says. If you take a closer look at such foods, you\u2019ll see they\u2019re lower in calories and have the requisite fiber you\u2019re looking for. It\u2019s best to check with your vet or a veterinary nutritionist to determine how much daily fiber is ideal for your dog. \u00a0 Looking for a quick, belly-filling fix for your dog? Reach for your refrigerator\u2019s veggie drawer. \u00a0 Remillard and Parker agree that cucumbers, green beans, carrots, celery, and broccoli are all good choices. Steaming or boiling them is an acceptable option, but Remillard adds that these methods begin to break down some of the fiber which makes these great options to start with. Your best bet for feeding veggies to your pup? Clean and raw. They\u2019re as good as or better than any commercial dog treat.\u00a0"}]
