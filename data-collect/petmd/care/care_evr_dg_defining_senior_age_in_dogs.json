We love senior dogs just as much as when they were puppies, but some of us might be in denial when it comes to admitting that they\u2019ve entered their senior years. And it can also be confusing knowing exactly when you should call your pup a senior, especially when that range is different for different breeds and sizes of dogs. Here\u2019s a guide for determining when your dog is truly considered to be a senior and recognizing signs of health issues so you can adapt her care to fit her needs. Is There a Set Range for a Senior Dog\u2019s Age? According to the Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA), the term \u201csenior\u201d can describe an aging pet, but the number of years a pet is considered to be \u201csenior\u201d varies. Identifiers such as weight, breed and the state of their organs can also help determine if your pet has reached old age. \u201cThough many old guidelines talk about seven dog years being equal to one human year, the size of the dog really depends on the extent to which you can follow that rule,\u201d says Dr. Heidi Lobprise, DVM, DAVDC, and spokesperson for the International Veterinary Senior Care Society. For example, large dogs will typically age faster than smaller dogs. \u201cFor a dog between 20-40 pounds, these guidelines are more effective, but it\u2019s not uncommon to see a geriatric Great Dane at age 7 or a Chihuahua in [his] 20s,\u201d Dr. Lobprise says.\u00a0 In most cases, however, dogs can be considered senior between 5 and 10 years old. \u201cThe terms &#039;geriatric&#039; and &#039;senior&#039; also differ,\u201d Dr. Lobprise says. \u201cWhile a dog may be considered senior, they\u2019re likely still healthy or just beginning to experience signs of aging. Geriatric animals are at the older end of the aging spectrum and often experience more health-related issues.\u201d Signs of Aging for Senior Dogs \u201cThere is a wide range of factors to help you recognize signs of aging in your pet\u2014many of them similar to the signs of aging in people,\u201d Dr. Lobprise says. Some of these factors may be more obvious, like an intolerance to exercise or limited mobility, while others are much more subtle. Your pet\u2019s behavior may also help indicate signs of aging. While cats don\u2019t always show that something is wrong until their issues become more advanced, many dogs are more demonstrative and vocal with their discomfort. Here are some things to keep an eye on: Eating Patterns and Weight You\u2019ll want to monitor your dog\u2019s eating patterns and body weight, as obesity can cause issues, including osteoarthritis and diabetes. A too-thin animal or dog that won\u2019t eat could be having dental or stomach issues. Sleeping Patterns and Cognitive Health Sleeping patterns and cognitive behavior are also things to look out for. A dog that isn\u2019t aware of his surroundings or has difficulty recognizing people may be experiencing early canine dementia. Drinking Patterns and Urination \u201cA less obvious but just as important sign of aging is how much your pet is drinking and urinating,\u201d Dr. Lobprise says. How much your pet is or isn\u2019t drinking can be indicative of many problems, from endocrine issues to kidney disease. Urinary incontinence in female dogs may also be a sign of trouble. It\u2019s challenging to watch for, especially in multi-pet households, but should be monitored if possible. Monitoring your dog\u2019s urination and defecation on walks can be a useful tool. Even if both are normal, you may notice your senior dog being slower or more resistant to posturing. Lumps and Bumps Being aware of your pet\u2019s overall body condition may also help you spot any abnormalities, like cancer. \u201cWe\u2019re keeping animals healthier and healthier now, and as our pet population is graying, an eventual cause of death is cancer, especially in specific breeds,\u201d Dr. Lobprise says. \u201cWe need to be aware of lumps and bumps.\u201d Many dogs develop lumps and bumps while they age. Not every lump will need to be tested or removed, but keeping track of them can avoid problems. Lumps that are new, growing or are different from the other ones on your pet can indicate a problem. Recognizing Common Diseases for Senior Dogs \u201cA very common and preventable disease that is prevalent in senior pets is dental disease,\u201d Dr. Lobprise says. \u201cWhile it\u2019s not always a serious disease to have, it is one worth paying attention to and can change your dog\u2019s demeanor if treated early and effectively.\u201d You can spot periodontal disease by smelling your dog\u2019s breath and regularly checking their teeth and gums for signs of bacterial infection, such as inflammation, reddened gums and tartar. Left untreated, dental issues can impact a dog\u2019s heart, kidneys and the rest of the body. If dental disease is causing discomfort, it may make your dog not want to eat, which can lead to all sorts of other problems; that is why your veterinarian recommends regular dental cleanings. Kidney and liver disease can be an issue for both cats and dogs, as can heart valve disease. Endocrine issues, including those impacting the adrenal glands and thyroid, can also affect aging dogs. Hypothyroidism can make older dogs feel lethargic and potentially gain weight. Unfortunately, Dr. Lobprise says, it&#039;s more common for multiple problems to compound each other in senior pets than in younger animals. Your pet\u2019s cognitive function is also a common issue; are they aware of their surroundings? Do they recognize their people? There are minor, natural declines in cognition as a part of the aging process, but as it advances, it can disrupt a pet\u2019s quality of life. Working With Your Veterinarian Dr. Lobprise recommends getting senior animals checked by their vets at least twice a year, complete with blood work, urine analysis and a full body examination, in addition to yearly dental cleaning, if needed. Unfortunately, however, the AAHA reports that only 14 percent of senior animals have regular health screenings as recommended by their vets. Having just an annual exam may [allow an issue to] progress into something worse that can impact the life span of your dog,\u201d Dr. Lobprise says. \u201cWhether it\u2019s kidney disease, heart disease or cancer, the earlier something is caught, the better,\u201d Dr. Lobprise adds. Talk to your veterinarian about what and how much your pet is eating, as different conditions will require different dietary needs to maintain a healthy weight. Some senior pets benefit from prescription dog food\u00a0diets aimed to help treat specific diseases. You should also take into consideration their lean muscle mass and body score. Your pet could be the same weight as always, but they may be retaining fluids and losing muscle as a result of some illness. To help keep track and recognize changes in your dog\u2019s weight, you can take photos or keep a body score chart at home. Depression and anxiety can also be issues with older pets, so you\u2019ll want to discuss this and any other behavior-related issues with your veterinarian. Your vet can provide you with prescription pet medication\u00a0to help ease anxiety and behavior modification training tools, but you\u2019ll also want to make sure their lives at home are as comfortable as possible. \u201cWhen looking at the senior or geriatric pet, there will be some rough days,\u201d Dr. Lobprise says. \u00a0 As a pet parent, you can help your pets thrive in their senior years by first admitting that they are indeed seniors, taking them twice a year to the vet for a checkup, and looking out for any issues that require your vet\u2019s immediate attention.
