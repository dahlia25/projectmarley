But are these cone of shame replacements worth the additional cost? Find out more.", "articleBody": "By Kerri Fivecoat-Campbell Most pet parents of four-legged fur kids will at some point have an experience with an Elizabethan collar\u2014more commonly known as the \u201ccone of shame.\u201d The traditional plastic cone, which is also sometimes called an E-collar or pet cone, is a sized plastic cone that keeps dogs and cats from turning their bodies to lick or chew on surgical sites, hot spots, or injuries. The E-cone has been called many things, including the \u201clampshade\u201d and \u201cpet radar dish,\u201d but is currently called the \u201ccone of shame\u201d by many due to the somewhat bad reputation it receives from pet parents, social media, and animals, too. \u201cEveryone hates it,\u201d says Jeff Werber, DVM, a veterinarian to celebrity pet parents at Century Veterinary Group in Los Angeles, Calif. \u201cAnimals hate it, and for pet parents, dogs especially are like bulls in a china shop\u2014running into things and knocking things over.\u201d The cone plays an important role in the healing process, however, but if your pet just can\u2019t stand the traditional collar, there are alternatives. History of the E-Collar Joel Ehrenzweig, DVM, and a corporate consultant in Richmond, Va., says that when he started practicing 40 years ago, there was no such thing as a pre-made E-collar. \u201cWe made them from X-ray film or cardboard for our patients and made a cushion for them out of adhesive tape.\u201d \u201cWhen our pets started making the transition from the barnyard to backyard to bedroom, more products began coming out for our pets\u2019 comfort,\u201d Ehrenzweig says. Around the same time the E-collar was becoming popular, surgical procedures advanced and more topical treatments for wounds helped pets to heal faster. The combination of the E-collar and shortened healing times helped veterinarians and pet parents accept the short-term inconveniences of the E-cone, says Ehrenzweig. \u201cThere are many products out now that can be an alternative to the plastic E-collar, but the trick is finding one that works best for your pet,\u201d he says. Alternatives to the Cone of Shame Erin Preiss, DVM, and veterinarian with The Vet House Veterinary Hospital in Richardson, Texas, says that there are several variations of the E-collar: Pillow collars Like E-collars, these fit around the neck of your pet, but are made of cloth or inflatable materials. Advantages: They look better than the E-Collar and are likely more comfortable. Disadvantages: If not fitted properly your pet may still be able to turn its body and chew or lick his wound. Padded rings, neck bands and donuts These are large, padded collars. Advantages: More attractive and more comfortable for pets. They also improve a pets\u2019 peripheral vision while wearing it. Disadvantages: The rings must be much larger in diameter to prevent the pet from turning around. Not desirable for animals that are left alone or for overnight as they make it hard for the pet to lie down. Cloth cones These cones are made of cloth and are sturdy to a certain extent, but are also collapsible. Advantages: Most likely a lot more comfortable for pets, and they look better Disadvantages: Some of these collapse too easily, making it all but a sure thing that a pet will scratch, lick, or bite an incision or wound if not being supervised. All of these alternative collars are generally more expensive than the traditional plastic E-collar. \u00a0 Some pet parents use commercial belly bands to protect surgical areas or wounds, but Preiss says that belly bands should only be used by a veterinarian to contain bleeding or if the vet has a concern about a pendulous abdomen after surgery. \u201cThe ones we use are custom fit to the need of the patient and are made from flexible bandaging material,\u201d says Preiss. \u201cA store bought belly band would trap moisture around the surgical site.\u201d Veterinarians Prefer the E-Collar While some of the alternatives to the plastic E-collar might work for your pet, Werber and other experts say the most reliable protection for your fur kid is typically going to be the plastic E-collar. \u201cMost pets will get used to it and do fairly well\u2014even cats,\u201d says Werber. But, he says, \u201csome pets may not do well, and some cats sometimes just shut down with it on. At that time I would start looking at alternatives.\u201d Werber says the inconvenience of the collar is only temporary. He says that many patients will only have to wear it for seven days, but some may have to go as long as ten days or as few as five, depending on the nature of the surgery or wound site. \u201cIf the pet is in a multi-pet household, the other pets may have to wear one too, or be kept away from the injured pet so they do not lick the wound site of the injured pet,\u201d says Werber. \u201cWe also tell our clients to keep that cone, as they will likely need it again at some point in their pets\u2019 lives.\u201d The most important tip he gives is to make sure the collar is fitted properly. \u201cIf it\u2019s too big, the pet cannot eat or drink. If too small, your pet will be able to turn around, defeating the purpose,\u201d he says. He says it\u2019s also very important that you follow your veterinarian\u2019s recommendations requiring your pet to wear a collar.\u00a0"}]
