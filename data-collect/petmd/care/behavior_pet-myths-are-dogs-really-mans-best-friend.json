Is this true. I guess whether or not you regard the dog is man's best friend depends a bit on how you define friend. Well, I don't know if I can speak for the men out there, but I can certainly say that their woman's best friend.\n\nLet's call it human's best friends. We don't actually know why humans and wolves go together in the first place. There are all sorts of ideas about how wolves used to come and scavenge of human rubbish. Once that relationship was initially established humans were selecting very rapidly for the most sociable wolves the ones that responded to humans in this characteristically dog like way.\n\nAnd so this was obviously something that humans valued from the get go. We've sort of matured going through this world together, and the relationship evolves. If you think about how dogs were utilized even 100 years ago They were part of the work, team. They were out there with you herding cattle or whatever it was that you were doing for a living your dog was there helping you do that.\n\nThey've gone from being that part of the workforce to truly becoming our best friends. Now I think that dogs value our companionship just as much as we value theirs because their family. We are the only family that they have unless they're other pets in the house. But it's magic.\n\nDogs make a much bigger effort to understand humans than humans do to understand dogs. They actually read our facial expressions and that might seem hard to believe, but there's a really cool test you can do. Look at your dog. Don't say anything and just smile.\n\nAnd I guarantee you're going to get a tail wag back. Dogs are constantly scanning scanning happy sad. What's going on. We should also look at our dogs and say or do you feel OK.\n\nAre you comfortable in this situation. Dogs are much more likely to listen to you when you have a happy face, which if we're talking about friendship is it always works. If I'm friends with someone and I know when someone is really, really, really upset, then I tend to be very cautious or maybe say, oh, OK. I'll call you tomorrow and when this person is happy.\n\nI'm eager to spend time with this person exactly the same for dogs. I have to admit, it's nice to have an individual who seems to really consider me to be the most important person in the world. In conclusion, I can say that dogs are man's best friend, but probably humans should make more of an effort to show this friendship to dog eat in a dog friendly way. I think that all we can do is hope that one day we're able to give them as much as they give us.", "potentialAction": {"@type": "SeekToAction", "target": "https://www.petmd.com/dog/behavior/pet-myths-are-dogs-really-mans-best-friend?wtime={seek_to_second_number}", "startOffset-input": "required name=seek_to_second_number"}}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "BreadcrumbList", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 0, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.petmd.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Training & Behavior", "item": "https://www.petmd.com/dog/behavior"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "Article", "headline": "Pet Myths: Are Dogs Really Man&#039;s Best Friend?", "inLanguage": "en-US", "isFamilyFriendly": "True", "isAccessibleForFree": "True", "articleSection": "Pet Care Center", "thumbnailUrl": "https://image.petmd.com/files/styles/863x625/public/mans-best-friend.jpg", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://image.petmd.com/files/styles/863x625/public/mans-best-friend.jpg"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "PetMD Editorial", "url": "https://www.petmd.com"}, "keywords": "Dog, General Care", "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "PetMD", "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.petmd.com/images/petmd_logo.png"}, "url": "https://www.petmd.com"}, "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.petmd.com/dog/behavior/pet-myths-are-dogs-really-mans-best-friend"}, "datePublished": "June 20, 2017", "dateModified": "August 16, 2022", "description": "There&#039;s a long held belief that dogs are man&#039;s best friend. Is this pet myth true? Watch as researchers, dog trainers and veterinarians discuss the dog-human bond.", "articleBody": "By Deidre Grieves\u00a0 When it comes to the bond between dogs and humans, the term \u201cman\u2019s best friend\u201d is frequently used to describe the inter-species relationship. But are dogs really man\u2019s best friend? Is there validity in this commonly held belief? According to researchers, dog trainers, and veterinarians, the answer is yes. Dr. James Serpell, director of the Center for the Interaction of Animals and Society at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, says that the modern-day bond between humans and dogs dates back centuries and can be traced to the early interactions between nomadic human hunters and wolves. \u201cWe don\u2019t actually know why humans and wolves got together in the first place, but once that relationship was established, humans were selecting, very rapidly, for the most sociable wolves\u2014the ones who responded to humans in this characteristically dog-like way,\u201d says Serpell. \u201cThis was obviously something that humans valued from the get go.\u201d As dogs\u2019 shifted into domesticated animals, they evolved to become part of the work force, helping humans with all kinds of tasks from herding to hunting. \u201cWe\u2019ve sort of matured going through this world together,\u201d says Dr. Katy Nelson, a veterinarian at the Belle Haven Animal Medical Centre in Washington, D.C., and a medical advisor for petMD. \u201cIf you think about how dogs were utilized, even 100 years ago, they were part of the work team. Whatever it was that you were doing for a living, your dog was out there helping you do it.\u201d Today, dogs are an integral part of family life, and studies show the strength of the animal-human bond. A 2015 study published in the journal \u201cScience,\u201d demonstrates that there is a real emotional connection that happens when dogs and people look at each other. Data from the study reveals that oxytocin levels rose in both humans and dogs after they looked into each other\u2019s eyes during a 30-minute period. Oxytocin is often referred to as \u201cthe love hormone\u201d because it\u2019s produced in the body when humans have close contact with the people they love. The hormone is also associated with maternal bonding and rises when mothers interact with newborn babies. Other studies show that dogs can recognize human facial expressions and make decisions based on those expressions, showing a high level of emotional intelligence in pet dogs. \u201cThey actually read our facial expressions,\u201d says Victoria Schade, a certified dog trainer, speaker, and author. \u201cThat might seem hard to believe, but there\u2019s a really cool test you can do. Look at your dog, don\u2019t say anything, and just smile. I guarantee you\u2019re going to get a tail wag back.\u201d Dr. Carlo Siracusa, a clinical assistant professor of behavior medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, explains that how humans interact with dogs has a big impact on a dog\u2019s overall demeanor. \u201cDogs are much more likely to listen to you when you have a happy face,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if we\u2019re talking about friendship\u2014that\u2019s how it works. If I\u2019m friends with someone and I know when [that person] is really, really, really upset, I tend to be very cautious. It\u2019s exactly the same thing for dogs.\u201d While dogs may be hyper aware of how their human counterparts are feeling, Schade says that some pet owners don\u2019t always give their dogs the same amount of consideration and attention. \u201cDogs are constantly scanning\u2014[wondering] whether we\u2019re happy or sad,\u201d she says. \u201cWe should also look at our dogs and say, \u2018Do you feel okay?\u2019 \u2018Are you comfortable in this situation?\u2019\u201d Siracusa agrees. \u201cDogs are man\u2019s best friend,\u201d he says. \u201cBut humans should make more of an effort to show this friendship to dogs.\u201d Despite human flaws such as texting at the dog park or cutting playtime short to binge watch Netflix, dogs remain loyal and loving companions. \u201cI have to admit, it\u2019s nice to have an individual there that seems to consider me to be the most important person in the world,\u201d says Serpell.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0"}]
