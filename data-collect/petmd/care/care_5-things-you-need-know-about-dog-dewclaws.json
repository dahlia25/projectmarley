Does it have a purpose, or should it be removed to prevent later problems or injuries? Learn the answers to these questions and more with our expert veterinarian, here.", "articleBody": "Take a look at your dog\u2019s feet. How many toenails do you see? Most dogs have four nails on each rear foot and five on their front feet. That extra nail on the upper, inner part of a dog\u2019s foot is the dewclaw. Did you come up with a different total? Have no fear, some dogs have dewclaws on their rear feet or even double dewclaws. But what, exactly, is a dewclaw, and is it a problem? What Are Dewclaws? Dewclaws are essentially the thumbs and big toes of the dog world. They are not directly equivalent to the human structures, of course, but they are similar. Looking at a dog\u2019s front foot, the toes that are in contact with the ground while standing correspond to our pinky, ring finger, middle finger, and index finger. The dewclaw is the \u201cthumb.\u201d The same is true for the canine hind foot with the dewclaw, if it\u2019s present, being the \u201cbig toe.\u201d An important distinction to make is whether or not the dewclaws are firmly attached to a dog\u2019s foot. In general, if your dog has a single front dewclaw, it will be. You\u2019ll be able to wiggle the dewclaw a little bit (mostly in a forward and backward motion), but you can feel the bones and ligaments that connect it to the leg. Rear and double dewclaws tend to only be attached by skin and are much more mobile. Do Dewclaws Have a Purpose? A dewclaw that\u2019s attached by bone to a dog\u2019s front foot has a definite purpose. When dogs run, their front feet often bend to the point where their dewclaws contact the ground. At high speeds (especially when turning) or on slippery surfaces, these dewclaws provide extra traction and help stabilize the carpal (wrist) joint. Some dogs also use their dewclaws to help them climb trees or hold objects to better chew on them. The usefulness of dewclaws that are only attached by skin is less clear. Should Dewclaws Be Removed? Because front dewclaws serve several important purposes, they should not be removed unless there is a\u00a0very\u00a0good reason to do so. In rare cases, a dog\u2019s dewclaw may be severely injured or develop a disease\u00a0(such as a cancerous tumor) and removal under those circumstances would be in the dog\u2019s best interests. But these problems occur so infrequently that removing healthy front dewclaws as a preventative measure makes little sense. Veterinarians will sometimes recommend removing loosely attached double or rear dewclaws to prevent injury. But the actual incidence of these problems is quite low, too, so the value of these surgeries is up for debate. Typically, the procedure is scheduled at the same time the dog is being spayed or neutered. Some dog breeds routinely have their front dewclaws removed to \u201cimprove\u201d their appearance in the show ring. When breeders elect to do so, they should have this procedure performed by a veterinarian when their puppies are under 5 days old and only after the area has been numbed with a local anesthetic. Keep in mind that removing the dewclaws in some breeds, like\u00a0Great Pyrenees, disqualifies them from the show ring. Treating Dewclaw Injuries While dewclaw injuries are relatively rare, they certainly do occur. Any nail can become partially or completely pulled off, broken, split, infected, or ingrown (if not properly trimmed). Because most nail injuries are extremely painful and prone to infection (think of all the places your dog\u2019s feet have been!), it\u2019s usually best to have them quickly assessed by a veterinarian. They can remove damaged nails or trim ingrown ones (under sedation, if necessary), and prescribe any needed antibiotics and pain relievers. How to Maintain Dewclaws When it comes to maintenance, dewclaws are no different from your dog\u2019s other nails. Extremely active dogs may wear down their nails\u2014including their dewclaws\u2014to the point where trims are not necessary. But for most pets, regular nail trims are needed to keep their nails at a healthy length\u2014especially for dewclaws, which aren\u2019t in contact with the ground as frequently as the other nails. Dewclaws may need more frequent trims and, without attention and care, can easily become overgrown. Featured Image: iStock/IRYNA KAZLOVA"}]
