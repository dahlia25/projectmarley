Have you ever put your dog in his dog crate, opened the door several hours later, and watched him make a beeline to where he was last chewing his rawhide dog treat? What about those stories of cats getting lost and finding their way back home years later? Or the dogs who bury their bones in the backyard being able to dig them up months down the road? These types of incidents suggest that pets are capable of forming memories, and not just short-term ones. Like Humans, Dogs and Cats Can Store an Array of Memories \u201cDogs and cats have different types of memories, just like we do. They have spatial memory, remembering where things are located, short-term memories, and long-term memories,\u201d says Dr. Brian Hare, associate professor of evolutionary anthropology at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. Los Angeles-based veterinarian Dr. Jeff Werber adds that pets are capable of storing many different types of memories\u2014\u201cfrom the little things like knowing where their food or litter box is, to recognizing people and places they haven\u2019t seen in years.\u201d Short-Term vs. Long-Term Memories According to Hare, short-term memory, or \u201cworking memory,\u201d is a kind of memory that allows people to keep information\u2014like a phone number\u2014in mind for a few minutes and mentally manipulate it.\u00a0\u201cThis may sound simple, but working memory is crucial for any kind of problem solving,\u201d he explains. \u201cWorking memory has been found to correlate with skills in learning, math, reading, and language. Researchers have even found some evidence that in children, working memory is more predictive of academic success than IQ.\u201d Long-term memories, on the other hand, are stored in your brain and can be retrieved at will, like childhood memories, or what you did last week or last year. \u201cLong-term memories do not fade in order. You might remember something that happened to you years ago better than you remember what you did yesterday,\u201d he explains. To distill it down, Dr. Bruce Kornreich, associate director at the Cornell Feline Health Center in Ithaca, New York, says that \u201cshort-term memory is anywhere between 5 and 30 seconds and long-term memory can remain almost indefinitely.\u201d Long-Term Memories in Pets \u201cThere are many examples of cats and dogs having long-term memory in both studies and in real-life events,\u201d says Dr. Jenna Sansolo, associate veterinarian at Ardsley Veterinary Associates in Ardsley, New York. \u201cFor instance, when pet owners go on vacations and come home to dogs that show the same excitement a human child would show after not seeing their family for the same amount of time, or the countless videos of dogs whose owners come home from military deployments that are all over the internet.\u201d Sansolo also points out that pets who have been abused or in less than ideal living situations can also show proof of long-term memory. \u201cI have seen many patients who are scared of tall men, hats, certain\u00a0noises, etc., which they can relate to a negative memory or event that has happened in the distant past,\u201d she explains. Laurie Santos, director of the Comparative Cognition Laboratory and the\u00a0Canine Cognition Center\u00a0at\u00a0Yale in New Haven, Connecticut, notes that when we think of long-term memories in pets, we are often referring to \u201cepisodic memories\u2014remembering particular episodes from long ago.\u201d She adds that while the topic hasn\u2019t been extensively studied, she and her colleagues have seen evidence that pets have some episodic memory abilities. \u201cFor example, dogs can remember where and what kinds of food were hidden\u00a0over longer time horizons, suggesting they&#039;re tracking some information about how and where food was hidden,\u201d she explains. \u201cThere&#039;s also evidence that dogs behave differently when owners leave for long versus short periods of time, suggesting that pets might remember something about how long ago their companion left.\u201d What Triggers the Formation of Memories in Pets? While pets can form memories about a variety of instances, experts suspect that extremely positive and/or negative experiences are what stick with them the most. \u201cImportant events, such as those related to food and survival, and events that have an emotional impact are more likely to be stored in the long-term memory,\u201d says Claudia Fugazza, department of ethology at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University in Budapest. \u201cThese memories have the power to affect your pet\u2019s behavior for a lifetime,\u201d Weber says. Dr. Veronica Cruz Balser, a veterinarian at the Metropolitan Veterinary Center in Chicago, agrees, adding that it sometimes takes only one impactful moment to cause a memory to stick with a pet for a long period of time. \u201cMy dog, Tony, was near a campfire once when someone decided to add excessive amounts of lighter fluid. The fireball that came towards us was very frightening for him, as he was not expecting it. He no longer will get near campfires,\u201d she says. How Far Back Can Dogs and Cats Recall? According to Cruz Balser, that\u2019s tricky. The subject hasn\u2019t been extensively studied, however, many experts have their own theories. The general consensus is that this is largely based on what level of impact the incident that initially formed the memory had on the dog or cat. \u201cIt depends on the type of event and emotions/reward/consequence of the event,\u201d Cruz Balser\u00a0says. Fugazza agrees. \u201cMemory decay depends on many variables, such as the type of memory used for storing the information, its importance, and its emotional valence [the strength of a positive or negative emotion]. Important information and memories with emotional content tend to be remembered for longer times.\u201d Do Dogs or Cats Have Better Memories? Studies show that dogs outperform cats when it comes to their short-term memory abilities. This leads experts, like Kornreich, to believe that the same would hold true when it comes to long-term memories. \u201cYou would extrapolate from the fact that dogs do better on short-term memory studies than cats do\u2014that they perhaps have better long-term memories,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe have to be careful about coming to that conclusion without it being tested. But it makes perfect sense to me to say, \u2018Well, if a cat forgets where something is in 30 seconds and a dog remembers where it is for a minute, then you would think that the dog not only has better short-term memory but perhaps it has better long-term memory.\u2019 But that is presuming that the mechanisms behind short-term and long-term memory are the same and they may not be.\u201d Monique Udell, assistant professor of animal and rangeland sciences at Oregon State University, points out that new research is looking specifically at fading memories in pets. \u201cWhile cats and dogs do have long term-memory, the precision and accuracy of these memories can decline over time, just as it does for humans,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe still have a lot to learn about the types of information that animals retain for long periods of time, but recent research into age-related memory decline and dementia in dogs may shed light on some of these questions, for both healthy dogs and those suffering from memory loss.\u201d Kornreich points out an interesting fact: Certain studies suggest that cats don\u2019t seem to have as much of an issue with memory decline as dogs do. \u201cIn humans, special learning tasks can be inhibited with aging. That appears not to significantly occur in cats,\u201d he explains. \u201cCats don\u2019t seem to have the same decline in terms of special learning tasks. That doesn\u2019t say that there may not be components of their cognitive function that don\u2019t deteriorate from time to time, but in terms of special learning tasks, at least based upon this study, they don\u2019t decline in that regard.\u201d Your Role in Your Pet\u2019s Memories While pets learn continuously throughout their lifetime, they form the most important impressions in their early days. \u201cPuppies and kittens both have periods early in their lives where they learn rapidly about many things in their world. The memories that are formed during this period influence how they behave for the rest of their lives,\u201d says Dr. Kersti Seksel, a registered veterinary specialist of behavioral medicine at Sydney Animal Behaviour Service in Australia. So it\u2019s extra important to expose them to the socialization and proper training and conditioning that they need during this time. Pet parents can help their dog or cat turn a potential negative long-term memory into a positive one, Cruz Balser adds. \u201cOur behavior influences our pet\u2019s behavior and memories more than people realize,\u201d she says. \u201cThe one that impacts me daily as a vet is client\u2019s behavior at the vet clinic and how they respond to their pet\u2019s stress.\u00a0If they&#039;re scared and you are anxious, then the memory of the building, the smell, and the people in that building will forever be scary.\u201d For this reason, Cruz Balser encourages people to swing by the vet clinic periodically for \u201chappy visits\u201d where pets get a treat and some love or just come in and then leave.\u00a0\u201cThat way, the pet can have experiences in the vet clinic that aren&#039;t scary or bad and it doesn&#039;t become engrained in them that the clinic is bad,\u201d she says.
