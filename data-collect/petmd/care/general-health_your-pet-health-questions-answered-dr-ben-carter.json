If you are a pet parent, you can use these recommendations and helpful info on dogs and cats to keep your pets in good health for years to come.\u00a0 What are the recommendations for keeping your pet\u2019s heart healthy? Dr. Carter recommends maintaining your pet\u2019s healthy heart through exercise and proper nutrition. \u201cSome things we can do at home to make sure our pets have a healthy heart include taking them for a walk for 15-20 minutes every single day and making sure that they eat a well-balanced diet,\u201d he says. According to Dr. Carter, a well-balanced diet is one that is approved by AAFCO and has the proper amount of carbohydrates, fats and proteins, as well as amino acids. There are essential amino acids that must be supplied in your pet\u2019s food, which can be found in protein. These amino acids help maintain the health of your pet\u2019s muscles, bones, blood, organs, immune system, and hair and nails. Fats and carbohydrates are important sources of energy for your pet and can help support their development, so it is essential that your pet\u2019s food contains the right balance of both. The proper combination of nutrients for your pet depends on their life stage, so it is recommended to buy dog food and cat food that\u2019s balanced for the age of your pet. What is the best flea and tick prevention and how often should I use it?\u00a0 The best flea and tick prevention for both indoor and outdoor pets, according to Dr. Carter, is in the form of a prescription oral medication that can be taken every 30 days. Dr. Carter says that oral flea and tick treatments are \u201cvery safe and very effective in flea and tick control.\u201d Dr. Carter advises pet parents to give their pets oral prescription flea and tick treatment\u00a0every month for year-round protection. Oral flea and tick treatments include flavored tablets and soft chews and are conveniently administered by mouth. This medication should be taken immediately after or in conjunction with your pet\u2019s normal meal.\u00a0 You can find these types of\u00a0prescription flea and tick solutions in the Chewy Pharmacy.\u00a0 Can CBD oil help with pain and illness? \u201cSo, CBD oils are something that is new to the veterinary market,\u201d says Dr. Carter. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the actual studies that say they are efficacious for dogs or cats. We are still in the realm of actually doing our studies to see how effective they are.\u201d Dr. Carter advises interested pet parents to stay tuned for more information on the topic, as more studies may be done on CBD oil for pets in the coming years. Should you brush your cat or dog\u2019s teeth? How often?\u00a0 Brushing your pet\u2019s teeth is extremely important for their health. \u201cWe definitely recommend you do it at least once or twice a day, but we know that it\u2019s hard to do,\u201d says Dr. Carter. \u201cSo, anytime that you can is super beneficial.\u201d It is also recommended that you take your pet for a professional dental cleaning once a year to maintain a healthy, clean mouth. How can you conquer separation anxiety in dogs?\u00a0 Separation anxiety in dogs occurs when an owner leaves the pet for the day or to go on a trip, and the pet responds with destructive or otherwise inappropriate behavior. \u201cSeparation anxiety is something that\u2019s really hard to deal with in veterinary medicine. Right now, what we recommend is a combination of behavior modification and either supplements or prescription pet medications, as directed by your veterinarian,\u201d says Dr. Carter. Changing your dog\u2019s behavior can take time and consistency, so it is recommended that pet parents consult with a behaviorist or experienced trainer if your pet struggles with separation anxiety. How often should I bring my pet to the vet? \u201cEvery pet needs to visit their veterinarian at least once a year,\u201d says Dr. Carter. These annual exams allow you to track your pet\u2019s growth and development, and they allow your veterinarian to identify any potential health issues so you can start any necessary treatments early.\u00a0 \u201cFor pets who are chronically ill or have any other conditions, I recommend to come in at least every six months or whatever was recommended by your veterinarian,\u201d he says. Even if your pet seems fine, it is essential that your veterinarian monitors the issue to ensure your pet is as healthy as they can be. What should I expect during a routine vet visit? \u201cDuring a pet\u2019s annual examination, we do a nose-to-tail physical exam,\u201d says Dr. Carter. Your veterinarian will look for hair loss, lumps, rashes, discoloration or unusual spots, as well as for fleas, ticks and mites. They\u2019ll check your pet\u2019s ears and eyes for discharge, swelling, redness or itching, as well as their dental health status by examining your pet\u2019s teeth and smelling their breath. In addition to a physical exam, \u201cWe make sure they\u2019re up to date on all their vaccines and that they also have enough preventative care items to get them through until their next veterinary visit,\u201d says Dr. Carter. A stool sample may also be required, which checks your pet for intestinal parasites."}]
