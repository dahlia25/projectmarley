Learn what signs you should look for to identify bad boarding kennels.", "articleBody": "\u00a0 By Monica Weymouth \u00a0 Getting ready to leave for vacation can be hectic. There\u2019s work to square away, suitcases to pack, neighbors to inform and thirsty petunias to consider. One thing you don\u2019t want to overlook? Thoroughly researching your pet\u2019s boarding kennel. Not all facilities are created equal, so we checked in with the experts for some common red-flags and signs that you should book Fluffy a room elsewhere. \u00a0 Your dog can\u2019t call you to report a problem, and cats rarely text back. With that in mind, it\u2019s important to personally inspect the boarding facility. \u201cYou should physically see the space your pet will be kept in, and the staff should want you to see it and be proud of it,\u201d says Carmen Rustenbeck, executive director and founder of the International Boarding and Pet Services Association (IBPSA), which provides education and certification programs. \u201cIf they aren\u2019t happy to show you the facilities, no matter how many good reviews they have, I wouldn\u2019t leave my pet there.\u201d Showing up unannounced and asking for a tour is the best way to get a feeling for what the place is like on a day to day basis. \u00a0 As pet parents know, accidents happen. That said, you shouldn\u2019t be greeted with unpleasant odors when arriving to the kennel. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason a facility should smell,\u201d says Rustenbeck. Even if things do seem sanitary, she recommends asking what type of cleaning products are used to make sure they\u2019re pet-friendly.\u00a0 \u00a0 When checking your pet in, a reputable kennel will ask you to provide paperwork documenting your pet\u2019s vaccination history. If not, your pet is at risk of contracting a potentially serious illnesses.\u00a0 \u00a0 The kennel staff should be able to provide you with a detailed emergency plan that\u2019s both species-specific and location-specific. If the kennel is in a flood-prone area, for example, they should know how to evacuate the cockatoos and the Chihuahuas. Furthermore, make sure to ask about around-the-clock staffing. \u201cA lot of people assume that there\u2019s a human on-site 24 hours, but that\u2019s not always the case,\u201d warns Rustenbeck. \u201cIf there isn\u2019t, you need to know what happens if there\u2019s an emergency at the facility and no one is there.\u201d \u00a0 Although the industry is largely unregulated, check to see if your kennel went the extra mile and invested in training. \u201cWe firmly believe that anyone who works in a pet care facility, including the receptionist, should be trained in pet care,\u201d says Laaman. \u201cThey\u2019re getting up and going to work every morning and taking on a huge responsibility.\u201d \u00a0 It\u2019s important that your dog has plenty of opportunities to play and socialize while at a boarding facility, but it\u2019s also important that everyone is safe. \u201cPlaygroups should be divided by size and by temperament,\u201d says Rustenbeck. \u201cSometimes we forget that all dogs have their own personalities. If you have a 75-pound geriatric dog, you don\u2019t want to just put him with the larger dogs\u2014he may be big, but he\u2019s probably less playful.\u201d \u00a0 Simply having access to the outdoors isn\u2019t enough. Make sure the area is clean, that dogs have access to shade and water, and that there is a high, double-fence system to prevent any escapes. That said, pet parents have to do their part, too. \u201cIf your dog is a gymnast, no matter how high the fence, let the facility know,\u201d advises Rustenbeck. \u00a0 When it\u2019s time to check out, you should expect to hear about how your pet did\u2014after all, your pup can\u2019t quite fill you in on the ride home. \u201cMinimally, they should be able to provide you with a verbal report of how well your dog did, and there should be some detail\u2014who their best friend was, how they were eating, how were their walks,\u201d says Laaman.\u00a0"}]
