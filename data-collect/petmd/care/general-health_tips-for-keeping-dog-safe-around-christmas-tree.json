Not only are all these things fun for us, but they\u2019re also intriguing to our pets. However, before you set up your tree and start taking out your decorations, take a moment to consider these Christmas tree safety tips to keep your pup happy, safe, and healthy throughout the holidays.\u00a0 Dog Christmas Tree Safety Tips It can be very difficult to keep a young puppy away from the Christmas tree, particularly if this is their first Christmas. Even an older dog\u2014who may have learned not to jump on the tree\u2014can still be curious. Here are a few pet safety hazards and precautions you should consider. 1. Don\u2019t Let Them Chew on Branches and Needles A live tree can be especially dangerous to pets. Dogs like to chew on a tree\u2019s limbs, and the fir tree oils can be irritating to your pup\u2019s mouth tissue, causing symptoms like\u00a0drooling\u00a0and\u00a0vomiting. If your pet is chewing on the branches, there\u2019s a pretty good chance that they are also swallowing the needles. When ingested, pine needles can get caught in a dog\u2019s intestinal tract, puncturing the lining or bunching together and causing an\u00a0intestinal obstruction. Both can be fatal. Additionally, you should be careful with artificial trees as pets are likely to chew those crunchy needles, too. These trees can cause the same kind of obstruction in a dog. The best way of protecting your pup from these afflictions is limiting their access to the area around your Christmas tree. Consider purchasing a dog-friendly gate or pen to surround the Christmas tree. 2. Don\u2019t Let Them Ingest Fake Snow Fake snow\u2014also called flocking\u2014is a popular Christmas tree decoration. However, it can cause serious problems in pups when large amounts of it are swallowed. If you\u2019re going to have a tree in your home, it\u2019s best to get a regular, non-flocked tree. 3. Keep Them Away From Christmas Tree Water Some trees are treated with chemical preservatives to keep them fresh longer. These chemicals drain into the water in the base of the tree, making the water\u00a0poisonous\u00a0to drink. Dogs will drink the water if the base of a tree is left uncovered. You should cover your tree\u2019s water with a tree skirt, towel, plastic wrap, or aluminum foil. However, putting a gate or pen around your tree is the safest and best preventative of toxicity in pups. 4. Maintain a Barrier for Christmas Tree Lights Christmas lights should be positioned away from the bottom of the tree. Electric cord injuries will damage a dog\u2019s mouth tissue and can lead to long-term problems eating, difficulty breathing, and even death. Regularly check the electric light cords frequently for signs of chewing (which is also a fire hazard). To ensure your pup\u2019s safety, put a gate or pen around your tree. You can also buy plastic fish tank tubing, split them, and cover your lights. This makes them much more chew-proof. 5. Keep Ornaments Out of Reach Hang your ornaments on the uppermost branches of your tree and tightly secure them on the branches. It\u2019s better if you select tree ornaments that don\u2019t easily shatter. For delicate glass, treasured, or priceless ornaments, consider creating an area where they can be displayed that is far out of reach of your dog&#039;s tail, paws, or mouth. You can hang these from a garland that\u2019s placed across a mantel, over a doorway or window, or you can hang them in shadowboxes on the wall. 6. Remove the Threat of Tinsel, Strings, and Candy Canes Tinsel is one of the most dangerous tree decorations you can choose. If your pet ingests even a few strands of tinsel, they are highly likely to develop an intestinal obstruction. This also occurs when edible ornaments\u2014such as popcorn and cranberry strings and candy canes\u2014are ingested by your pup. These strings can tear a dog\u2019s intestines and can be fatal. Leave these decorations off your tree. Other decorations that can be deadly to dogs (and children) include: Angel hairSpun glass or plastic decorationsGarlandsLit candlesMistletoePoinsettia plantsHolly berriesAdvent calendars that hold candy and/or chocolateLiquid potpourri, which can be spilled or ingestedRemember that it\u2019s better to be overly cautious to protect your pup from holiday hazards. By following these tips, you can be confident in creating a happy, healthy holiday season with your furry, four-legged family member. Featured Image: Getty Images/luliaa Zavalishina"}]
