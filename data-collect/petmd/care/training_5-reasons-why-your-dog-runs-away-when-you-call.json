The basic steps of training a dog to come when called are straightforward, but many pet parents don\u2019t realize just how much work goes into building a long-term, reliable recall. Add to that the fact that we can accidentally \u201cun-train\u201d the behavior, and you have a recipe for a very frustrating dog training scenario. The following are some typical mistakes made when trying to teach a dog to come when called. The Dog Was Punished in the Past Sometimes frustration can get the best of pet parents when a dog won\u2019t come, which can result in the dog getting scolded, or worse yet, physically punished, when he finally does listen. Unfortunately, getting mad at your dog once he\u2019s at your side won\u2019t teach him what he should do; it will only make him less likely to come running to you in the future, because he knows you\u2019ll be upset when he gets there. You want your dog to think that coming to you is a wonderful thing, so even if you\u2019re disappointed by his less-than-speedy response, make sure to avoid scolding him when he gets to you. Then, try to set him up for success in future training sessions by making it easy for him to \u201cwin\u201d the recall game. Always reward him with high-value dog treats\u00a0like Pet Botanics Training Rewards, which have a bacon flavor that\u2019s sure to rev up your dog\u2019s recall responses. \u00a0\u00a0 You Sounded Angry When You Called Your Dog If someone shouted, \u201cGet over here NOW!\u201d at you, would you be eager to listen? The same goes for our dogs, yet many pet parents let their tone of voice convey anger when calling their dog. A loud, mad voice will make your dog less likely to run to you since he can tell that you\u2019re displeased. Instead, always keep your tone upbeat as you call your dog, and don\u2019t forget to praise your dog as he starts his trip toward you. You might discover that he picks up speed when he hears that he\u2019s doing a great job! Remember to reward your dog with a small, meaty treat every time he reaches you, particularly when you\u2019re in a distracting environment. Switching to a novel protein, like Merrick Power Bites rabbit and sweet potato treats, will help keep your dog interested in what\u2019s in your pocket. You Trained Your Dog to Come in Limited Environments The early training you did with your dog probably took place in a dog training facility and continued in a few rooms in your house as well as in your yard. Your dog probably became proficient at responding in those environments, which made you feel confident that your dog fully understood the recall cue. However, dogs typically don\u2019t generalize behaviors well, which means that even though your dog was responsive in familiar environments, he might not be able to translate coming when called to brand new locations. To increase your dog\u2019s recall \u201cfluency\u201d it\u2019s important to train your dog to come when called in a variety of settings. Practice with your dog in new environments, like a friend\u2019s fenced-in yard or community tennis courts during the off season, and then gradually expand to more distracting spaces, like the dog park. The Word \u201cCome\u201d Means the Fun Is Over Some dogs ignore the recall because they understand that the word \u201ccome\u201d means that they have to leave the dog park, or stop chasing squirrels in the yard, or go into their dog crate\u00a0because you\u2019re heading to work. Consistently pairing the recall cue with something that your dog doesn\u2019t like will result in a dog who equates the word \u201ccome\u201d with negatives. That\u2019s not to say that you should only use your recall word in positive situations, but you should be aware of how your dog might perceive what the word \u201ccome\u201d means. To combat the idea that coming when called equates to the end of fun, try to do \u201csurprise\u201d recall practice in situations when your dog is just hanging out around the house, and reward him with a tasty treat and a quick game of tug. Or call him in from the yard, praise and reward him, then send him out to continue playing. That way your dog won\u2019t be able to tell if the fun is truly ending or if it\u2019s just a practice run! If you\u2019re concerned about the number of treats you\u2019re giving your dog, opt for a low-calorie goody like Fruitables Skinny Minis pumpkin and berry treats, which have less than five calories per treat. You Repeat the Word \u201cCome\u201d So Much That It\u2019s \u201cVerbal Wallpaper\u201d \u201cFido, come\u201d is a very different cue than \u201cFido, come, come, come, come on, c\u2019mere, Fido come!\u201d Many dogs delay responding to the recall cue because they\u2019ve figured out that they don\u2019t have to do it until you say it a few thousand times. Instead of having a conversation with your dog when you want him to come running, it\u2019s better to use a single-word cue, like \u201ccome\u201d or \u201chere,\u201d and then follow up with upbeat kissy noises, whistling or hand clapping to encourage him along. Plus, it\u2019s important to continue to reward your dog with a high-value treat, like Crazy Dog Train Me! Minis, for longer than you might think is necessary. Keep in mind that racing to you, particularly when your dog is hanging out with a canine buddy or a enjoying a good smell, is huge compliment. It makes sense to pay your dog for a job well done!
