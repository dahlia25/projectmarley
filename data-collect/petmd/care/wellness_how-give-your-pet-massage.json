But can cats and dogs benefit from touch, too? The research is limited, but veterinary experts say yes. Working with a certified veterinary massage therapist is your best option, but that doesn\u2019t mean your cat or dog can\u2019t benefit from a gentle at-home massage, too. Here, find out how to give your pet a massage. How Cats and Dogs Benefit from Massage There isn\u2019t a lot of scientific data to confirm whether or not massage benefits animals, but veterinary experts still recommend it. \u201cTheir circulation is analogous to ours and their nervous systems are also analogous to ours, which means the benefits that are seen humans can be expected to be similar in [pets],\u201d says Dr. Robin Downing, hospital director at The Downing Center for Animal Pain Management in Windsor, Colorado. Pet massage can increase range of motion and flexibility, aid in digestion, reduce scar tissue, improve muscle tone and increase lymphatic circulation, says Trish Houser, owner of Smiling Dog Pet Services in Anchorage, Alaska and board-certified canine massage practitioner. \u201cMassage is also beneficial to older pets experiencing pain with inflammation, dysplastic conditions and arthritic issues.\u201d It can also alleviate anxiety in pets, says Stacy Litzky, a board-certified canine massage practitioner and owner of South Paw Massage and Wellness in Vero Beach, Florida. \u201cIt helps dogs by decreasing blood pressure, relieving tension, calming the nervous system and boosting the immune system, which is unable to function effectively when the nervous system is chronically or excessively stressed.\u201d You\u2019ll also strengthen your bond and be attuned to problems that may arise, says Houser. For example, \u201cYou might notice a new lump pop up or soreness in the body that you didn&#039;t realize was there until you touch and massage them,\u201d she says. Getting Started Start with a relatively calm animal, says Houser. Try to choose a time when your pet is already relaxed (i.e. don\u2019t do massage after a vigorous play session) and allow your pet to calm down as much as possible before beginning, Houser adds. In addition, massage should be given on the animal\u2019s terms. Your session can last anywhere from ten minutes to an hour, but ultimately your best friend will let you know when he\u2019s had enough, says Amber Lane, owner of Denver, Colorado-based Olympic Haven. Next, find a quiet, comfortable area in your home. \u201cA yoga mat and towel can be placed on the floor for comfort,\u201d Lane says. \u201cPet massage music is one of my favorite ways to add immediate comfort to both owner and pet.\u201d \u201cLet your dog or cat decide what position is most comfortable. They might lay down, sit, or even stand up. This is supposed to be relaxing and pleasurable, so don&#039;t pressure them,\u201d adds Houser. Unless you\u2019re trained in massage, experts recommend avoiding complicated techniques like acupressure and range of motion therapy and just focusing on the basics. Additionally, check with your veterinarian before you massage your animal, especially if your best friend has health issues. \u00a0\u201cYou don&#039;t want to massage an animal with a fever, severe infection or one that is suffering from shock,\u201d says Houser. \u201cAnd you don&#039;t want to massage a dog with bacterial or fungal skin conditions, as massage can spread them and make them worse.\u201d In addition, animals are experts at masking pain, so recognizing the signs are essential. \u201cDogs in pain typically are more depressed and not as active. They might limp or cry out in pain when touched. They may not eat as much and can act agitated or anxious, possibly pacing or showing other restless behavior,\u201d Houser says. If you believe your animal is experiencing new, as-of-yet undiagnosed symptoms (including pain), call your veterinarian in lieu of attempting massage. How to Give Your Pet a Massage The best way to massage your pet is with a gentle touch, particularly when working on a cat. \u201cCats mostly prefer a much gentler massage. I think with cats, everything has to be on their own timing,\u201d says Rachael Davis, a registered veterinary technician and certified canine massage therapist with Georgia Veterinary Rehabilitation, Fitness and Pain Management. \u201cI think they can benefit just the same as dogs, but a lot of time their personalities hinder them from being receptive.\u201d Lane recommends starting the massage with slow, gentle strokes along your pet\u2019s body to relieve tension, keeping in mind your animal\u2019s size (using small motions for small animals and larger motions for larger animals). Don\u2019t forget about the face, head, neck and ears, she adds, and use soft, circular motions around the muzzle.\u00a0 \u201cThen, use broad and gentle strokes on his hind quarters and soft squeezing compression down his legs, taking care to be extra gentle on boney areas and the backs of the thighs, as there are very sensitive hairs there that can cause irritation if brushed the wrong way,\u201d Houser says. You can incorporate brushing or combing your pet in the massage if your pet enjoys being groomed but be careful about using any other products. \u00a0\u201cProducts aren&#039;t really necessary for massage, although some essential oils are becoming more common in helping to calm and reduce anxiety,\u201d Houser says, but keep in mind that some are toxic to pets. \u201cOils vary greatly in their purity, safety and efficacy, so talk with your vet about what to use, how often to use it and dosage.\u201d To determine whether or not your pet is enjoying the massage, take note of their reaction. Your companion may be so relaxed that he falls asleep, says Lane. \u201cTheir eyes may get heavy, they may drool, and they may let out long exhales or groans. These are all signs that your pet is benefitting from your touch,\u201d she says. As for the frequency of your pet\u2019s massages, Houser recommends gentle massage as often as needed, while intensive massages can be more occasional. \u00a0\u201cPassive-touch massage [using very light pressure] for relaxation and anxiety can be given as often as needed over the animal\u2019s lifetime,\u201d she says. \u201cDeeper muscle massages will be less frequent, once or twice a week depending on the issue, and under veterinary or massage practitioner guidance to prevent overworking muscles and causing damage to soft tissues.\u201d By Paula Fitzsimmons"}]
