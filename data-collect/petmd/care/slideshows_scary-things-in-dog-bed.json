They include thousands of microorganisms \u2013 parasites, bacteria, viruses and fungi. Find out how to limit the spread of these not-so-welcome guests and how to properly clean your dog\u2019s bed to ensure a safe sleeping environment. \u00a0 \u00a0 Your dog may catch fleas or mites from another animal (or from you in some cases) and bring them into your home and his dog bed. \u201cFleas can hitch a ride into your home on your pant leg or shoe,\u201d says Dr. Jeffrey Stupine, head veterinarian at the Pennsylvania SPCA. \u201cIf you get little red spots on your ankles or your pet is scratching, it\u2019s probably fleas. If you have an infestation, there may be invisible larvae waiting to hatch in your dog\u2019s bedding.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cRingworm is not a worm but a fungal infection, medically known as dermatophytosis, that infects a dog\u2019s skin, hair and claws and gets its name from the round, pink lesion it forms on the skin [in people],\u201d says Dr. Daniel Morris, a veterinary dermatologist at University of Pennsylvania Veterinary School. Symptoms in dogs include redness, itching, hair loss, crusty patches and brittle claws. \u00a0 Ringworm spores shed by a dog can live in the environment\u2014including his bedding\u2014for up to two years. If left untreated, the fungal infection can spread and infect other animals or humans living in your home.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Roundworms (nematodes\u00a0or\u00a0ascarids) are parasites that live in the intestine of dogs. These parasites feed off of partially digested intestinal contents. According to the Companion Animal Parasite Council (CAPC) many \u00a0infected dogs shed roundworm eggs in their feces, and your dog may be infected by ingesting the infected feces or by eating a small, infected animal such as a mouse. Roundworms may also be passed from a mother to her puppies. Symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, weight loss, dull hair, coughing and a potbellied appearance.\u00a0If your dog is infected with roundworms, his bedding may contain invisible eggs. \u00a0 Named for their fishing hook shape, hookworms live in the small intestine, ingest their host\u2019s blood, and shed their eggs in feces. Your dog may get hookworm from eating contaminated soil or infected prey animals, larvae may burrow through the skin, or puppies may contract hookworms from their mothers. Symptoms of hookworms include weight loss and diarrhea. If your dog has hookworm, his bedding may contain hookworm larvae, which are transmitted through fecal matter that may be invisible to the eye. \u00a0 \u00a0 People usually associate Salmonella and Listeria with human food-borne illnesses but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has found that 25 percent of commercial raw dog food tested positive for these harmful bacteria. Symptoms of Salmonella and Listeria infection in dogs include high temperature, refusal to eat, weight loss, diarrhea, vomiting and lethargy. \u00a0 According to the CDC, dogs can carry\u00a0the harmful bacteria\u00a0in their intestines without showing signs of illness and expose humans in the household. To avoid the risk, the CDC recommends cleaning all surfaces, including bedding, on a regular basis, washing your hands thoroughly, safely storing and handling raw pet food, not letting your dog lick you around your face, and cleaning up your dog\u2019s poop carefully. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Wash dog bedding regularly. When buying a bed for your dog, pay close attention to the washing instructions. If the bedding can be machine washed in hot water and dried on a high setting, you\u2019ve got a winner. \u201cHigh heat is the only way to kill parasites, their larvae and bacteria,\u201d says Morris, who recommends washing your dog\u2019s bedding weekly. \u00a0 Keep your dog clean and well groomed. \u00a0\u201cAdequate brushing can often decrease the need for bathing,\u201d says veterinary dermatologist Staci Wiemelt, VMD. \u201cThe average dog that isn\u2019t out having fun in the mud and doesn\u2019t have any skin conditions can safely be bathed every three months.\u201d \u00a0 If your best friend loves getting dirty and needs to be bathed more often, try a mild vet-approved dog shampoo or use plain, lukewarm water. Between shampoos, you may want to use vet-approved wet wipes to clean your dog\u2019s paws before he enters the house. \u00a0 Use\u00a0prescription flea and tick medication. Don\u2019t forget to keep giving flea and tick medication year-round to avoid the presence of these nasty parasites in your home. Work with your veterinarian to find the best option for your dog. \u00a0 \u00a0"}]
