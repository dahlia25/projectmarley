Spaying and neutering is\u00a0also associated with increased health benefits and longevity. One study on reproduction&#039;s impact on lifespan and cause of death in dogs found that sterilization increased life expectancy in females by 26.3 percent and in males by 13.8 percent. But if you\u2019re a first-time pet parent, you may have heard or read statements that give you pause. Neutering my dog will alter his personality. Spaying a female cat before a first litter is dangerous. Spay and neuter surgeries are unaffordable. These are all myths. If you\u2019re not sure what to believe, read on as veterinarians who are intimately connected with the issue help separate fact from fiction. As with human medicine, animals are unique individuals, which is why the best person to talk to about your pet\u2019s health needs is, of course, your vet. Myth 1:\u00a0Females Who Have One Litter Before Getting Spayed Are Healthier There\u2019s no evidence that females who give birth before getting spayed reap any health benefits, says Dr. Susan Konecny, medical director for Best Friends Animal Society in Kanab, Utah. \u201cIn fact, spaying female dogs and cats before their first heat cycle eliminates their risk of ovarian or uterine cancer, and it also greatly reduces their risk of mammary cancer.\u201d With each heat, an animal\u2019s health risks actually increase. Konecny cites a study on mammary tumors in female dogs, in which researchers found that individuals spayed between their first and second heats had an 8 percent risk of developing malignant tumors when compared with intact females. That figure jumped to 26 percent when performed between the third and fourth heats. And spaying later than that put the female at the same risk level as intact dogs. Spaying before the first litter also eliminates the risk of other pregnancy-related emergencies, says Dr. Holly Putnam, director of operations for Shelter Outreach Services in Ithaca, New York. This includes dystocia, a condition in which \u201ckittens or puppies are unable to pass through the birth canal during labor, requiring an emergency C-section.\u201d Myth 2: Neutering Diminishes an Animal\u2019s \u2018Masculinity\u2019 Unlike humans, animals have no actual concept of their sexuality, Konecny says. \u201cAnd spaying or neutering will not change your pet\u2019s natural disposition. For example, neutering male dogs does not render them useless for protection or guarding.\u201d\u00a0 Neutering (or spaying) also has no effect on an animal\u2019s natural instinct. \u201cA dog&#039;s intelligence and personality is formed more by genetics and environmental factors than by sex hormones,\u201d Maher says. What sterilization does do, Maher says, is decrease testosterone, which can result in significant health benefits, including a reduced risk of prostate disease and testicular tumors. And it can help reduce undesirable behaviors, Konecny says. \u201cWhat we do know is that neutering male dogs was most effective at reducing urine marking, mounting behaviors and roaming, and neutering male cats greatly reduces or eliminates urine spraying, roaming, and fighting with other males.\u201d Myth 3: Surgery Is Too Expensive Look at it this way: not opting for spay or neuter surgery may cost you more in the long run. You\u2019re ultimately responsible for all those lives, whether you decide to keep them or adopt them out. Fortunately, affordable options are available when it comes to sterilization surgeries. Pricing for spay and neuter surgeries varies by region and vet office. \u201cMost regions in the U.S. have at least one spay/neuter clinic within driving distance that charges $100 or less for the procedure,\u201d Maher says. Many veterinary clinics provide discounts through subsidized voucher programs, she adds. \u201cLow-cost spay and neuter is becoming more widely available all the time.\u201d To find low-cost spay and neuter providers in your area, check out the database created by PetSmart Charities and ASPCA. Some organizations may even be willing to perform spay and neuter for free. \u201cContact your local animal shelter or humane society, or your veterinarian, and tell them that you are looking for discounted spay or neutering services,\u201d Konecny recommends. Myth 4: Sterilization Is Directly Responsible for Weight Gain Spay and neuter surgeries decrease the level of sex hormones, which does indeed slow down an animal\u2019s metabolism, Konecny says. \u201cTherefore, this has to be taken into account after the pet is spayed or neutered.\u201d But mostly, animals become overweight due to lack of appropriate diet and exercise\u2014not specifically from being spayed or neutered, she says. \u201cDogs and cats are often fed quantities based on pet food manufacturers\u2019 recommendations. Some will do well on the recommended amount, while others may need more or less food (usually less),\u201d Konecny explains. \u201cThe age at which a dog or cat should be changed over to adult food will vary based on breed, size, and individual activity level and as your animal ages, it is important to adjust their diet and their exercise regimen accordingly so they remain healthy later in life.\u201d Other reported factors contributing to obesity include an animal\u2019s breed, housing environment, age, and even the weight and age of the pet parent (our lifestyles can often rub off on our animals). \u201cThe truth is that the problem of companion animal obesity is multi-factorial and research studies indicate that spaying or neutering prior to 5 months of age may decrease the incidence of obesity,\u201d Maher says. The Debate Surrounding Spay and Neuter \u00a0 Spay and neuter surgeries are not without their criticisms. \u201cThere is a great deal of controversy surrounding early spay/neuter based on recent studies on purebred dogs,\u201d Konecny says. \u201cThis has created a great deal of debate as well as controversy in regards to what the appropriate age is.\u201d She says several published studies look at the long-term effects of spaying animals at an early age. \u201cThese studies received quite a bit of attention as they indicated that there may be a greater risk of developing certain types of cancers and musculoskeletal problems later in life in dogs that underwent early-age spay/neuter. However, many epidemiologists agree that further research needs to be performed before making any changes to our current age recommendation.\u201d The current age recommendation for spays and neuters is 6 months. Yet puppies and kittens currently and routinely undergo spay or neuter as early as 8 weeks of age, especially in animal shelters and high-volume spay and neuter clinics, says Putnam, who also serves on the board of the Association of Shelter Veterinarians. \u201cIf you\u2019re concerned about your puppy or kitten undergoing a surgery at such a young age, consider that most veterinary hospitals, animal shelters, and high-quality, high-volume spay/neuter clinics are experienced and highly skilled with meeting the anesthetic and surgical needs of pediatric animals.\u201d Ultimately, your vet will be in the best position to determine if your cat or dog is a good candidate for spay or neuter."}]
