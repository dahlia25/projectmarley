But then on some days, he\u2019ll be withdrawn or unleash an angry bark storm for no apparent reason. Chances are, you chalk this up to him waking up on the wrong side of the dog bed. But can canines actually have bipolar disorder just like humans? The answer: \u201cNot exactly,\u201d says Dr. Peter L. Borchelt, a board-certified animal behavior consultant based in Brooklyn, New York. Bipolar disorder is \u201ca mental health condition which causes extreme shifts in a person\u2019s mood, energy, and ability to function,\u201d according to the International Bipolar Foundation. People living with a bipolar condition experience the highs of mania and the lows of depression. A dog\u2019s emotions don\u2019t fluctuate dramatically from high to low and back again, Borchelt says. Instead, their mood changes are often triggered by an external factor. \u201cFor a dog, it\u2019s not like they have a biochemical reason to switch between states, like [people living with bipolar disorder] do,\u201d Borchelt says. \u201cIt\u2019s almost always a response to something in their environment.\u201d For example, a dog could be friendly and affectionate around his or her family members, but then once a stranger comes onto the scene, that same dog may suddenly be afraid, aggressive, or fearful. \u201cSo, it\u2019s a switch in polarity, so to speak,\u201d Borchelt says, but it\u2019s not comparable to the manic and depressive episodes that people with bipolar disorder experience. \u00a0 Think of it like this: Say you usually have a warm, positive disposition, but you\u2019re extremely afraid of spiders. So when you see a creepy spider crawling in your room, you suddenly get scared and only return back to your normal mood once you remove the bug (or run screaming and ask someone else to handle it). That\u2019s not a sign of bipolar disorder, Borchelt says\u2014it\u2019s just a temporary mood change caused by a certain trigger. Although dogs have the same basic brain chemistry and structures as humans, their behavior and mental health issues likely don\u2019t manifest the same way, mainly because of language and cognitive differences, says Trish McMillan Loehr, a certified dog trainer and dog behavior consultant based in Weaverville, North Carolina. \u201cWe can&#039;t yet hack into canine brains and know just what they&#039;re thinking,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I suspect dogs can&#039;t ruminate over the same sorts of sad thoughts that depressed people do.\u201d But emotional events, such as being surrendered to a shelter or the death of a friend, can cause behavioral changes in dogs that are consistent with depression, Loehr adds. A dog may stop eating, pace around, or appear nervous or subdued. \u201cDogs have most of the same emotions as humans do, and can show behavior that looks somewhat like depression in humans,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd they can certainly feel anxiety.\u201d So, what else can trigger your pooch to change moods? Plenty of things. Let\u2019s use the example of a new visitor entering the family home: \u201cIf that person comes into your dog\u2019s territory and he or she is too boisterous, it might make your dog afraid or aggressive,\u201d Borchelt says. \u201cWhat we see a lot is that dog will calm down when he warms up to the stranger,\u201d he continues, \u201cbut when the person makes a quick move to get up, the dog will freak out and bark because they think he\u2019s going after their owner. That\u2019s one sudden switch from friendly to defensive.\u201d Your dog might be overly protective of his (and your) house, and so may bark when he senses a threat\u2014like that pesky doorbell that sounds when the FedEx guy drops off a package. Or maybe it\u2019s an occasional dominance issue, Borchelt says: \u201cHe might not want you interrupting him while he\u2019s eating, or waking him up while he\u2019s sleeping,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you can almost always find this external trigger. You can\u2019t do the same with [people living with bipolar disorder], since it\u2019s something internal.\u201d The first step is identifying that trigger, Borchelt says. Once you zero in on the cause of your pup\u2019s mood swings, you have two strategies for modifying his behavior. The first is a method called desensitization. Let\u2019s say your canine companion goes crazy every time there\u2019s a nasty thunderstorm. To nip this in the bud, you might buy a weather sound effects CD and play the thunder track at a soft volume so that you make a little sound to get your dog\u2019s attention\u2014but not freak him out. Then as long as your dog stays calm, \u201cyou keep doing it so you gradually increase the level of sound,\u201d Borchelt says. \u201cThat way you get your dog used to the thing that startles him.\u201d The second strategy is called counter conditioning. \u201cThis is where you bring in a positive stimulus to counter the negative one,\u201d Borchelt says. Does your dog hate the doorbell? Try Borchelt\u2019s trick: Push the button gently so your dog hears the first \u201cding,\u201d give him a treat to calm him down, wait several moments, then\u00a0slowly take your finger off the button so the chime finishes.\u00a0Gradually repeat this so your dog learns to associate the annoying sound with something positive. You should consult with a behaviorist and your veterinarian to determine the best course of action, but another treatment option is dog medication, Borchelt says. \u201cThe drugs that often work the best for anxious dogs are SSRIs like Prozac and Zoloft,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re inexpensive, and they work very well for certain types of behaviors. But you have to talk to your vet first.\u201d Also, keep in mind that medications aren\u2019t often a solution on their own\u2014they work best in combination with desensitization and counter conditioning strategies.
