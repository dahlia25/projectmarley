They Want Something Demand barking, Spaulding says, occurs when a dog wants attention of some kind. Maybe that\u2019s a walk or just to be pet. It could also signify that your dog wants food. Unlike other types of barking, demand barking has a specific and identifiable cadence to it, Spaulding says. \u201cDemand barking tends to be shorter\u2014a single bark or a few in quick succession. There are more pauses in between, and the dog is usually looking at you or the thing they want. It\u2019s much more controlled,\u201d she says. The million dollar question with this type of barking is whether you should respond to it. \u201cI tend to ignore it or actively get up and walk away if a dog demand barks at me,\u201d Spaulding says. That\u2019s because caving and giving dogs what they want can reinforce the behavior and encourage them to demand bark more in the future. If you decide you want to give in, however, Spaulding says it\u2019s best to do that after the first or second bark, if you can, because waiting teaches dogs they have to bark a lot to get what they want, and they may become very pushy in the future. They\u2019re Alarmed Most dog owners have likely experienced this when the doorbell rings and their dog just freaks out. \u201cAlarm barking is associated with something catching the dog\u2019s attention,\u201d says Sandra Sawchuk, a primary care clinical instructor at the University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine. If you want this type of barking to stop, Sawchuk says the most important thing is to not yell at the dog. That just tends to rile him up even more. Instead, divert the dog\u2019s attention as quickly as possible by taking him outside or giving him a favorite toy\u2014something he can chew on will work especially well to get him to stop barking. Sawchuk also recommends considering training your dog to go to a spot away from the door whenever the bell rings. This might be something you can do yourself, or you may have to hire a certified professional in your area to assist you. They\u2019re Anxious The emotion behind this is similar to alarm barking, but the context can be very different. Sawchuk says anxious barking may occur when you\u2019re leaving the house for the day. You might also see it on walks when a stranger or another dog is approaching. To that end, Spaulding says this type of barking often gets confused for aggression. \u201cTypically, if a dog is barking in an aggressive context, it\u2019s actually fear based,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople are often confused by that because if dogs lunge and bark at the same time, that must mean they\u2019re aggressive, but often, it seems to just be a display to keep them away from something they find scary.\u201d They\u2019re Excited During walks, a dog may let out an excited bark if they see another pup along the way, Spaulding says. \u201cYou\u2019ll also see excitable barking when dogs are doing something they enjoy, like chasing a small animal or for agility dogs when they run a course.\u201d The fine line between fearful and excited can be especially difficult when you\u2019re dealing with on-leash reactivity, and Spaulding says leash-reactive dogs should probably be evaluated by a certified professional. In most other situations of excitable barking, however, the context is usually pretty clear. \u201cIf they\u2019re backing away from something, they\u2019re probably afraid,\u201d Spaulding says. \u201cIf they\u2019re jumping up on you when you come home from work, they\u2019re probably excited.\u201d They Simply Want Attention Context means so much when you\u2019re trying to discern why your dog is barking, but Spaulding says it can sometimes be entirely unclear to you what your dog wants, assuming he wants anything at all. \u201cOften, a dog\u2019s bark means he\u2019s bored or frustrated, and he wants us to fix it,\u201d she says. \u201cIn situations where you\u2019re not sure what the cause of the barking is, it\u2019s fair to assume your dog would like to interact with you.\u201d If your dog won&#039;t stop barking, you can try these training tips to help stop the behavior.\u00a0"}]
