Although we know these particular surgeries are for the best, it\u2019s still tough to see your dog in recovery. If you\u2019ve never had a pet spayed or neutered before, you might be wondering what to expect when it comes to recovery for dogs. Some dogs bounce back more quickly than others, but there are ways to ease the recovery process. You can set your pet up for success by being as prepared as possible before you bring them home. A good way to do this: Assemble a home kit for neuter and spay recovery for dogs with everything your pet needs. What To Expect for Dogs Recovering From Neutering or Spaying Before you leave the veterinary clinic, ask any questions you have regarding post-op care. Some pet parents prefer to bring a list of questions with them in case they forget something in the moment. If any questions do slip your mind, remember that you can always call your vet for advice. Your dog will likely be groggy or, at the very least, more subdued than usual. It\u2019s not uncommon for a dog to take it easy for the first 24 hours following a surgery. But if your pup seems eager to run around, you\u2019ll need to slow them down\u2014you don&#039;t want\u00a0any stitches to pop! Care Tips for Neuter or Spay Recovery Be sure to follow your veterinarian\u2019s post-op instructions carefully. To prevent the incision from opening up, do not allow any jumping, running, or rambunctious play for 10 days or so after surgery. Dogs recovering from neutering or spaying may need to be separated from other pets in the home. It\u2019s important to let your dog heal completely. Many pets require a\u00a0dog recovery collar or cone\u00a0around their head to prevent them from licking the incision. There are also recovery suits you can try if your pup hates having a cone around their neck. Call your vet if you notice any of these warning signs after spaying or neutering a dog: Swelling or discharge at the incision site Lethargy Loss of appetite Vomiting and/or diarrhea 6 Must-Have Items for Your Neuter or Spay Recovery Kit Now for the fun part\u2014assembling your home kit for your dog\u2019s neuter or spay recovery.

Try draping the PetFusion premium reversible dog and cat blanket across your dog\u2019s favorite spot on the couch, or make their crate more comfortable with a machine-washable option like the\u00a0Frisco Sherpa dog blanket. 3. Pain Medication As part of your spay and neuter recovery plan, your vet probably sent your dog home with some pet pain medications.
