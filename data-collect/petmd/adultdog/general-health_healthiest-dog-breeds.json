And while there\u2019s no guarantee that any dog will be free from illness their whole life, there are dog breeds that face fewer health problems overall. The healthiest dog breeds have a long lifespan and are less susceptible to getting sick. This, when coupled with maintaining an appropriate weight and keeping up with exercise, means pet parents can ensure their dogs have the best life possible. How to Keep Your Dog Healthy Just like us, dogs\u2019 lifestyles play a part in keeping them healthy. As pet parents, we can do several things to prolong the lives of our beloved pups. Exercise Exercise plays an important part in preventative care for dogs. It\u2019s never too late to start your pup on an exercise routine, and doing so will give her long-term benefits. Exercise is a great way to combat obesity and allows your dog to ease into her senior years without the added stress extra weight puts on her body. Diet Pet parents should also be mindful of what they\u2019re feeding their dogs. According to the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO), a balanced diet must have six nutrients: water, carbohydrates (including fiber), vitamins, minerals, fat, and protein. You should also check the label to make sure you\u2019re giving her an appropriate amount to eat.  Vet Care Routine veterinary checkups benefit all animals, even a dog with few health issues. Annual checkups mean vets can catch the start of any hereditary diseases\u2014or even prevent them altogether. Healthiest Dog Breeds 1.
