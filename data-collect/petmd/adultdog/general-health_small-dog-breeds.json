Here\u2019s what to know about the best small dog breeds.", "articleBody": "Cute and compact, there\u2019s a lot to love about small dog breeds. But there are also lots of different types of small dogs, and no two are exactly alike. Here are some of the best toy and small dog breeds that can fit into your family. 1. Chihuahua Photo credit: iStock/Ziga PlahutarWeight: 6 pounds or less Height: 5\u20138 inches Chihuahuas are charming little dogs who make adorable companions thanks to their sassy personalities and spunky nature. One of the longest-living dog breeds, Chis are full of energy and liven up any room they\u2019re in\u2014which is usually whatever room their beloved pet parents are in. 2. Pomeranian Photo credit: iStock/romasetWeight: 3\u20137 pounds Height: 6\u20137 inches With their cute strut and beautiful coat, Pomeranians are a popular lap dog. But they weren\u2019t always the little dog breed we know today\u2014Pomeranians are actually descended from sled dogs, and their predecessors weighed around 30 pounds. But once they captivated Queen Victoria and became more popular, Poms were selectively bred to be the tiny, cute dogs we know today. 3. Yorkshire Terrier Photo credit: iStock/STOWEN SETOWeight: 7 pounds Height: 7\u20138 inches The Yorkshire Terrier, or Yorkie, is a playful, energetic, and affectionate dog. Like other small dog breeds, Yorkies don\u2019t handle the cold well and may be prone to hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). 4. Shih Tzu Photo credit: iStock/vitapixWeight: 9\u201316 pounds Height: 9\u201310 inches Small but mighty, the Shih Tzu was bred by Buddhist monks in Tibet to look like a little lion. These tiny, cute dogs are very attached to their pet parents and their long and luxurious coats need lots of attention to stay tangle-free. This breed does best with an attentive family who will brush them a few times throughout the week. 5. Papillon Photo credit: iStock/Oleksandra VyshnovaWeight: 5\u201310 pounds Height: 8\u201311 inches Elegant and stylish, Papillons are named after their wispy ears that resemble butterfly wings (papillon means \u201cbutterfly\u201d in French). This small dog is also highly intelligent and needs ample activity and mental stimulation to ward off boredom. Some of the Papillon\u2019s favorite pastimes are taking long walks, running an agility course, and playing with their favorite people. 6. Toy Poodle Photo credit: iStock/gollykimWeight: 4\u20136 pounds Height: 10 inches or less Toy Poodles are the smallest of the Poodle breeds (the other two being the Standard and the Miniature). Like their larger cousins, Toy Poodles are smart and playful, and they probably don\u2019t mind bath night (which should be every two to four weeks). 7. Affenpinscher Photo credit: Adobe/Ilona DidkovskaWeight: 7\u201310 pounds Height: 9\u201312 inches German for \u201cmonkey terrier,\u201d it\u2019s easy to see how the Affenpinscher got their name: Their distinctive flat, bearded face makes this small dog breed look more like a monkey than a pup.

Maltese Photo credit: Adobe/EvaWeight: 7 pounds or less Height: 7\u20139 inches The Maltese is a small white dog known for their straight, sweeping curtain of fur. Despite their long coat, this toy breed isn\u2019t a heavy shedder and is often labeled as \u201chypoallergenic\u201d (although there\u2019s no truly hypoallergenic dog). \u00a0Still, Maltese can be a good choice for people with allergies. 9.

Brussels Griffon Photo credit: Adobe/otsphotoWeight: 8\u201310 pounds Height: 7\u201310 inches Brussels Griffons are adorable and sociable companions. Their wide-set eyes give them a childlike, expressive face that adds to their endearing \u201cVelcro dog\u201d personality.
