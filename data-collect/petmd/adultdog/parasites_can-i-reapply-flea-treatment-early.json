Instead of dosing your pet again, find out why your flea treatment might not be effective and what you can do about it.", "articleBody": "Are you still seeing fleas after using a topical flea prevention treatment? What should you do now? This is a question asked by frustrated people with itchy pets every day. You might be applying the medication incorrectly\u2014and, if you did, wondering whether you should reapply. Or maybe the flea treatment simply stopped working for your pet (yes, that can happen). Here\u2019s why you might still be seeing fleas on your dog or cat, and what you should do about it. Is It Safe to Reapply a Flea Treatment Early? If you\u2019re finding fleas on your pet even after their topical flea treatment, you might be tempted to reapply it early. But this solution is not always recommended\u2014and it can even lead to an overdose in some rare cases. Because there are so many different flea and tick medications available on the market, it\u2019s difficult to speak to all of them in broad strokes. But to be safe, you should always follow the instructions on your specific topical flea medication package. Flea preventions typically use one or two active ingredients. Each brand uses different active ingredients that work in different ways to prevent fleas. If you have already reapplied your pet\u2019s topical flea treatment early, stay alert for signs of an overdose. For most flea preventatives, overdose symptoms include: Profuse drooling Vomiting Tremoring Hyperexcitability Agitation Seizures Weakness Difficulty breathing\u00a0 Call your vet immediately if you notice any of these symptoms. Why Isn\u2019t My Flea Treatment Working? You\u2019ve been diligently applying topical flea prevention to your pets, but you are still seeing them scratch\u2014and you might even be seeing flea eggs or dirt. Here are four common reasons why this might be happening. 1. You\u2019re Applying the Flea Treatment Incorrectly Incorrectly applying topical flea prevention is the most common cause for why it\u2019s not working. Topical medication should be applied directly to the skin, not to your pet\u2019s fur. You must part their hair so you can apply it to the skin. Read the instructions on the package\u2014while most topical medications tell you to apply it all in one spot at the base of your pet\u2019s neck, a few will have you apply it to several spots along your pet\u2019s back where they can\u2019t reach. Be sure to completely empty the tube, as the liquid is measured for your pet\u2019s weight and the entire dose is required to be effective. 2. Your Flea Medication Has Become Ineffective Always talk to your veterinarian to find the best and most effective flea treatment for your pet. Your vet will know which products work well in your region, as some that may have been effective at one time may no longer be killing fleas the way they used to. They may also have personal favorites or recommendations based on your pet\u2019s particular needs. 3. Your Home Hasn\u2019t Been Treated for Fleas Most flea preventions do not repel fleas. Rather, flea preventions kill fleas by direct contact with the parasites or from the fleas feeding on your pet. New fleas from the environment can\u2014and will\u2014jump onto your pet to feed. So, along with using topical treatments, you need to treat your home to provide the best defense against fleas. And it\u2019s not just adult fleas you need to watch out for. In fact, they only make up less than 5% of the flea population. You should be treating your home the other 95%\u2014flea eggs, larvae, and pupae. Flea eggs and larvae can live in the environment for days or even weeks. To keep fleas out of your home: Regularly vacuum everywhere your pet spends time Wash all their begging in hot water Treat every pet in the household for fleas (even indoor-only cats!) Treat the home (either with a professional exterminator or a pet-safe flogger) 4. Not All of Your Pets Are on Flea Treatment Don\u2019t forget to treat all dogs and cats in your house, not just the itchy ones.\u00a0If one pet in the house has fleas, they all have fleas. It\u2019s best to keep all pets on flea medication to prevent reinfestation. And remember: Just because you don\u2019t see a flea doesn\u2019t mean your pets don\u2019t have them or don\u2019t need to be on flea treatment. How to Apply Topical Flea Treatment Flea prevention is expensive, and you don\u2019t want to waste a dose! But applying topical flea medication correctly can be a little tricky. Here are a few major brands and how to apply them. Note: While all these products are made for dogs and cats, they are species-specific. Always make sure you are using the dog product on a dog and the cat product on a cat. It\u2019s also very important to use the appropriate weight range for your pet.\u00a0  Bravecto\u00ae Bravecto\u00ae is a prescription flea/tick medication for dogs and cats.
