While the medication is OK in small doses, it might not be the best choice for your dog. Learn more about using Pepto-Bismol for dogs.", "articleBody": "It\u2019s no secret that dogs love to eat anything and everything, including things that are not necessarily good for them. If your dog has ingested something they shouldn\u2019t have, it\u2019s natural to reach for the medicine cabinet. But while Pepto-Bismol is a go-to aid for human stomachaches, is it safe to give to your dog? What Is Pepto-Bismol? Pepto-Bismol is an over-the-counter medication used to treat upset stomach, diarrhea, indigestion, heartburn, and nausea in humans. This medicine also coats the lining of the stomach and intestines to help protect against irritation caused by acid buildup. While it\u2019s not recommended as a daily supplement, people have found success using this medication on occasion to relieve digestive issues. The active ingredient in Pepto-Bismol is bismuth subsalicylate, which can also be effective in treating some of the same digestive issues in dogs. But before you give your dog any medication\u2014even one considered relatively safe\u2014it\u2019s important to talk with your veterinarian first. Can Dogs Have Pepto-Bismol? When used in moderation, Pepto-Bismol isn\u2019t toxic for dogs. In fact, it\u2019s been found to be an effective treatment for diarrhea in dogs when given in small doses. But when Pepto-Bismol is used in excess, it can actually cause vomiting and diarrhea in dogs. Again, it\u2019s important to talk to your veterinarian before giving any medication to your dog, as there may be other underlying issues at play. Pepto-Bismol is only recommended for mild cases of diarrhea and not for long-term or recurring problems. Chronic diarrhea could be indicative of a more severe underlying issue. Potential Side Effects of Giving Your Dog Pepto-Bismol Besides causing vomiting and diarrhea, giving your dog too much Pepto-Bismol can cause dehydration, liver failure, and can have serious consequences on the kidneys. Additionally, repeated use of the medication isn\u2019t recommended because it\u2019s been linked to gastrointestinal issues, such as ulcers. Other possible side effects include: Constipation Black stools Loss of appetite It\u2019s also important to note that because bismuth subsalicylate has aspirin-like properties, it should never be given to dogs that have a clotting disorder or those taking other medications containing aspirin or salicylates without first consulting your veterinarian. Additionally, Pepto-Bismol can interfere with certain antibiotics, such as tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. Make sure you tell your vet if your dog has recently taken either of these medications. These stipulations aside, Pepto-Bismol may be given safely to most healthy dogs with no known health problems. However, this drug should never be given to puppies younger than 12 weeks old because of their sensitive digestive systems and immature organs, or to pregnant or nursing dogs without consulting your veterinarian first. In general, vets recommend not giving human medications (including Pepto-Bismol) to dogs unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary. Pepto-Bismol Dosage for Dogs The amount of Pepto-Bismol you give your dog depends on their weight and should be determined by a licensed veterinarian or veterinary pharmacist. It\u2019s important not to exceed the recommended dosage. The best way to find out how much Pepto-Bismol is safe for your dog is by consulting with a vet who knows your dog\u2019s health history. If you give your dog Pepto-Bismol and their stomach upset symptoms persist after two days or get worse, talk to your vet immediately. There may be other underlying issues causing your dog distress. How To Help a Dog With an Upset Stomach Pepto-Bismol isn\u2019t necessarily the best option for treating diarrhea or an upset stomach in dogs\u2014it depends on what is causing the discomfort in the first place. Other medications may be more effective at targeting specific causes of digestive upset, such as inflammation or infection, than this over-the-counter drug. If your dog is experiencing an upset stomach, a bland diet of shredded chicken and white rice can help to sooth their soreness. Bone broth, pumpkin, potatoes, oatmeal, plain yogurt, eggs, and white fish may also be beneficial in getting them on the road to recovery. If you notice signs of digestive upset in your dog, always talk to your vet before making any decisions regarding medical treatment. While Pepto-Bismol is OK for dogs in small doses, remember that this drug was formulated specifically for humans. If your vet decides Pepto-Bismol is the right medication for your dog, follow all instructions carefully and never give your pet more than the dosage recommended by the veterinarian.
