Because dogs with kidney disease usually aren\u2019t feeling well, the first step is often to merely get your dog to eat anything. Kidney disease can make dogs nauseated, and they can also develop ulcers in their mouth or stomach, which makes eating painful. A feeding tube may be necessary to get dogs with severe kidney disease the nutrition they need. Once your dog\u2019s condition is more stable, you can turn your attention to providing more optimized nutrition. Kidney diets for dogs have to tick a lot of boxes. Here\u2019s a guide that explains nutritional needs and what to feed a dog with kidney disease. What To Look For in a Kidney Diet for Dogs Kidney diets for dogs are significantly different from regular dog foods. However, no single kidney diet is going to be best for every dog throughout the rest of their life.\u00a0 For example, a dog in the early stages of kidney disease could thrive on a kidney diet with more protein, but as their disease progresses, a diet lower in protein and phosphorus might better control their symptoms.\u00a0 As a rule of thumb, good kidney diets for dogs tend to have a\u00a0nutrient profile\u00a0that looks like this:\u00a0 Nutrient\u00a0 Grams/1000 kcal\u00a0 Protein\u00a0 31-41\u00a0 Phosphorus\u00a0 0.5-0.8\u00a0 Sodium\u00a0 0.4-1.2\u00a0 EPA and DHA\u00a0 0.4-1.2\u00a0 \u00a0 Unfortunately, it can be hard to\u00a0find this information on dog food labels\u00a0or on pet food manufacturers\u2019 websites. If you are having trouble getting the numbers, your veterinarian can help you pick a good kidney diet based on your dog\u2019s needs.\u00a0 Here are several important elements to look for in kidney diets for dogs:\u00a0 Taste\u00a0 The most important characteristic of a kidney diet for dogs can be the hardest to achieve: It has to be delicious! That\u2019s because the metabolic and physical changes associated with kidney disease can lessen a dog\u2019s appetite.\u00a0 To counteract this effect, kidney diets need to smell and taste great. After all, a kidney diet that isn\u2019t eaten isn\u2019t going to do a dog any good. Kidney diets should also be calorie- and nutrient-dense, so dogs can eat less and still get a lot of nutrition.\u00a0 Hydration and Water Content\u00a0 Kidney diets should also contain a lot of water. Dogs with kidney disease struggle to maintain their hydration. All dogs always need to have access to bowls of fresh clean water, but a diet that has high water content is a great way to boost a pet\u2019s water intake when they have kidney disease.\u00a0 Wet foods are almost always a better option for dogs with kidney disease than dry foods. If you are feeding your dog kibble, ask your veterinarian about adding water to the dry food or other ways you can supplement their water intake.\u00a0 It&#039;s also important to keep an eye on the sodium levels in kidney diets for dogs. Too much sodium increases the chances that your dog will become\u00a0dehydrated.\u00a0 The Right Amount of the Right Protein\u00a0 Next comes the balancing act that is protein. Dogs with kidney disease need protein, but not too much. The breakdown products of protein digestion are responsible, in large part, for making dogs with kidney disease feel \u201cyucky.\u201d\u00a0 The goal is to feed just enough protein to meet a dog\u2019s needs for muscle maintenance, immune function, and the other vital jobs proteins have in the body\u2014but not to feed too much more. Extra protein will only be turned into calories that can be more safely provided by carbohydrates and fats.\u00a0 Protein quality is also important. Proteins should be highly digestible and supply all the essential amino acids dogs need.\u00a0 Low Phosphorus Levels\u00a0 There\u2019s a close relationship between protein intake and blood phosphorus levels. Dogs with kidney disease gradually lose the ability to excrete phosphorus in their urine, so it backs up in the bloodstream. Reducing phosphorus intake has been shown to slow the progression of kidney disease in dogs and increase their lifespan.\u00a0 An important way to reduce phosphorus levels in the diets of dogs with kidney disease is to not overfeed protein and to ensure that\u00a0proteins relatively low in phosphorus\u00a0are included in the diet. Plant-based sources of protein tend to be lower in phosphorus than animal-based sources of protein.\u00a0 Supplements\u00a0 Nutritional supplements can also help dogs with kidney disease. Supplements often included in kidney diets for dogs include:\u00a0 Omega-3\u00a0fatty acids:\u00a0eicosapentaenoic\u00a0acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which can reduce inflammation in the body\u2014including in the kidneys\u2014and possibly improve kidney function\u00a0 Antioxidants,\u00a0which neutralize free radicals that can further damage the kidneys\u00a0 Fermentable fiber,\u00a0which helps get rid of protein digestion waste products in poop. This allows dogs to eat more protein than they might be able to otherwise.\u00a0 Prescription Kidney Diets vs. Homemade Kidney Diets for Dogs  What about\u00a0homemade kidney diets for dogs? A\u00a0study\u00a0published in 2012 showed how hard it is to find nutritionally complete and balanced kidney diet recipes in books and online. Of the 39 recipes evaluated, none met all the National Research Council\u2019s recommended nutrient allowances for adult dogs.\u00a0 In contrast, prescription kidney diets produced by reputable dog food manufacturers undergo testing to ensure they are safe for long-term feeding and have a positive effect on a dog\u2019s health.\u00a0 How To Cook for Dogs With Kidney Disease  One big benefit of homemade kidney diets, however, is taste. If your dog simply won\u2019t eat anything else, a homemade kidney diet is worth considering. To avoid nutrient deficiencies or excesses, make sure a veterinary nutritionist or a service like\u00a0BalanceIT, which requires veterinarian approval, is involved in formulating recipes for your dog.\u00a0 Common Prescription Kidney Diets for Dogs  After a dog has been diagnosed with kidney disease and their condition is stabilized, veterinarians typically recommend switching over to a prescription kidney diet. Your veterinarian may have recommended a particular food based on the details of your dog\u2019s case. Here are three popular options:\u00a0 Hill&#039;s Prescription Diet k/d Kidney Care\u00a0is available in wet and dry formulations and different flavors: Purina Pro Plan Veterinary Diets NF Kidney Function\u00a0is available in wet and dry formulations: Royal Canin Veterinary Diet Adult Renal Support\u00a0is available in wet and dry formulations, different flavors, and for both early and more advanced kidney disease: How To Transition Your Dog to a Kidney Diet  special attention to how you make the transition. Do not\u00a0change your dog\u2019s food\u00a0while they are still nauseated or feeling bad. They may associate their symptoms with their new food and refuse to eat it.\u00a0 Once your dog has a good appetite, start making the switch very slowly. Give them lots of time to get used to the new flavors, textures, and ingredients. This reduces the chance of food refusal and lets your dog\u2019s digestive system adapt.\u00a0 Here is a timetable for taking two weeks to switch your dog to a new diet:\u00a0 Days 1 and 2:\u00a0Mix 5% of the new food in with 95% of the old food\u00a0 Days 3 and 4:\u00a0Mix 10% of the new food in with 90% of the old food\u00a0 Days 5 and 6:\u00a0Mix 20% of the new food in with 80% of the old food\u00a0 Days 7 and 8:\u00a0Mix 40% of the new food in with 60% of the old food\u00a0 Days 9 and 10:\u00a0Mix 60% of the new food in with 40% of the old food\u00a0 Days 11 and 12:\u00a0Mix 80% of the new food in with 20% of the old food\u00a0 Days 13 and 14:\u00a0Mix 90% of the new food in with 10% of the old food\u00a0 Day 15:\u00a0Try 100% of the new food\u00a0 If at any point your dog turns their nose up at their food or develops signs of digestive upset, move back a step in the timetable and proceed more slowly.\u00a0 Signs to Watch for After Starting Your Dog on a Kidney Diet  Don\u2019t give up if you initially have trouble switching your dog to a kidney diet. Call your veterinarian if your dog won\u2019t eat the recommended food. They can help by:\u00a0 Recommending an appropriate food topper to make the food more appealing. Avoid products that are high in phosphorus and salt.\u00a0 Prescribing medications to reduce nausea, stomach inflammation, ulcers, or other symptoms that may be reducing your dog\u2019s appetite\u00a0 Recommending a different prescription kidney diet or, if necessary, a suitable over-the-counter food\u00a0 Referring you to a veterinary nutritionist to get recipes for homemade kidney diets\u00a0 Talking to you about the benefits of a feeding tube\u00a0 Many dogs with kidney disease live happily for quite a long time, particularly if they get the right kind of nutrition. One\u00a0study\u00a0showed that on average, dogs who were fed a kidney diet lived 13 months longer than those who ate regular dog food. That\u2019s certainly a goal worth striving for!\u00a0 Featured image: iStock.com/RichLegg\u00a0"}]
