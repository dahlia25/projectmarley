We\u2019re breaking down the most common dog sleeping positions and what these cute positions mean about your pup.", "articleBody": "If you\u2019re a pup parent, you\u2019ve probably noticed that dogs sleep in a variety of positions\u2014which may or may not look very comfortable to us. \u201cIn most cases, which position they choose likely depends on their preference in the moment,\u201d says Dr. Patrik Holmboe, head veterinarian at\u00a0Cooper Pet Care. \u201cHowever, there are a few tidbits of information that can be gleaned from a sleeping position.\u201d \u00a0  So, what do your dog\u2019s sleeping positions mean?\u00a0 The Side Sleeper \u00a0  A common sleeping position for humans, dogs also enjoy sleeping on their sides with their limbs extended and their bellies partly exposed. Because bellies are a vulnerable part of the body, this sleeping position generally indicates a pup feels calm and content, Holmboe says. They\u2019re likely sleeping deeply, and you might even see dreamy paw twitches. Pups who snooze in this position are typically happy-go-lucky and can plop down just about anywhere, although they\u2019d prefer a large bed like the\u00a0FurHaven Ultra Plush Luxe Lounger. It lets them sprawl in comfort and offers orthopedic support.\u00a0 Weather can also factor into your dog\u2019s sleeping position. If it\u2019s a hot day and you notice your pup sprawling on the cool tile, they\u2019re trying to cool down. When that\u2019s the case, consider offering a cooling pad, like this pressure-activated one by the Green Pet Shop. The Lion Pose  In the lion pose, sometimes called the sphinx pose, pups who are just falling asleep and want to stay alert might sleep belly down with their head perched on their front paws. Lion-pose pups are alert, loyal, and caring toward their families. If you have a\u00a0newborn at home, don\u2019t be surprised if your furry companion assumes this position at the foot of their bed. To keep your pup comfortable, give them a cozy place to rest their paws, like the\u00a0Frisco Quilted Orthopedic Bed. This pose may also indicate\u00a0your pup is anxious and ready to jump up at a moment\u2019s notice. When anxiety is at play, a calming bed like\u00a0The Original Calming Shag Fur Donut Cuddler can help your dog feel calm.\u00a0 The Superman  Holmboe says\u00a0French Bulldogs and\u00a0Pugs are often seen enjoying the superman pose. Stomach down with back legs straight out behind them and front legs stretched forward, these pups are just as silly as their sleeping position. They\u2019re also brimming with energy, so you\u2019ll need a bed that can be used indoors or outdoors while enjoying your mischievous canine&#039;s playful antics, such as the Frisco Steel-Framed Elevated Dog Bed. The Belly Up  Dubbed \u201cthe dying cockroach,\u201d Holmboe says this pose is a favorite of\u00a0Greyhounds, as well as other lovable canines. You\u2019ll find dogs in the belly up pose sleeping on their backs with their bellies fully exposed and legs in the air. These dogs are playful and loving\u2014or they\u2019re still puppies. You might wonder how this position could be comfortable and if it\u2019s safe for your pup, but Holmboe assures us that dogs typically don\u2019t choose to sleep in uncomfortable positions. However, as dogs age, they may switch to another posture, such as the side sleeper, since belly-up sleeping can put pressure on the spine. This\u00a0Wave Fur &amp; Velvet Bed by FurHaven offers two bolstered sides for optional neck and head support. It&#039;s made of orthopedic foam to take pressure off your pup\u2019s back and continues supporting their joints as they age and swap sleeping positions. It also has heat-dissipating cooling gel, just in case your pup is in the belly up pose to cool down. The Doughnut  Curled up in a tight ball, dogs in the doughnut pose have their limbs tucked close to their bodies, their nose near the tail. These pups are sweet and caring, but they tend to be reserved around strangers or are\u00a0settling into their new homes. This posture also traps body heat, so a curled-up canine might be cold. The\u00a0K&amp;H Pet Products Thermo-Snuggly Sleeper is a great choice for dogs who sleep in the doughnut position. The bolstered sides offer security, and the bed can be plugged in to auto-heat to fit your dog\u2019s optimal temperature. \u201cA dog that feels unwell might also be curled up in a ball,\u201d Holmboe says. So, if this is an unusual position for your dog, keep an eye on them and consider scheduling a check-up with your veterinarian. The Cuddle Bug  Holmboe says there\u2019s nothing wrong with letting your dog sleep in bed with you\u2014and that\u2019s just the vibe the cuddle bug dog is striving for. However, if you prefer not to let your dog sleep in your bed, they\u2019ll also happily curl up with you on the couch or with another pet. These pups tend to love everyone they meet, furry or not, and might be called\u00a0Velcro dogs by some. Dogs should have a bed to call their own. However, the cuddle bug dog might enjoy the\u00a0Best Friends by Sheri Throw Shag Dog &amp; Cat Blanket. They can take it wherever they want to cuddle, and it\u2019s big enough for them and a furry friend. Dogs sleep a lot (16\u201320 hours per day for puppies!), Holmboe says. So, don\u2019t be surprised to see your pup enjoying more than one of these silly sleepy positions at any time of day. Featured Image: iStock/Evrymmnt"}]
