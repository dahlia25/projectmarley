Here&#039;s what to know about probiotics for dogs and prebiotics for dogs, and how the bacteria benefits your pup.", "articleBody": "Here\u2019s a fun fact: A mammal\u2019s intestinal tract contains approximately 10 times more microbes than the number of cells in the rest of their body. This is likely true for dogs, cats, and even people. Is it any wonder why the intestinal microbiome\u2019s role in our health is the focus of such intense research? Nutritional supplements that contain probiotics and prebiotics are popular ways to support a healthy microbiome. Let\u2019s take a look at some common pre- and probiotics and what they do inside a dog\u2019s body. Probiotics for Dogs Probiotics are nutritional supplements containing beneficial living microorganisms that are normally found in the gastrointestinal tract. While we don\u2019t know exactly what each microorganism does, most probiotics for dogs are designed primarily to support digestive health. But they can have other effects as well. Lactobacillus Lactobacillus bacteria are included in many probiotics meant to support intestinal health. They may help restore the intestinal microbiome after imbalances that have occurred due to dietary changes, antibiotic use, or stressful events like boarding or traveling. This can improve a dog\u2019s appetite and get rid of diarrhea. Because so much of a dog\u2019s immune system is located in the intestinal tract, Lactobacillus bacteria are also given to support a healthy overall immune response. Lactobacillus species to look for include: Lactobacillus acidophilus Lactobacillus plantarum Lactobacillus casei Lactobacillus brevis Lactobacillus bulgaricus Enterococcus and Bacillus In the gut, Enterococcus and Bacillus bacteria are thought to have many of the same effects as Lactobacillus, including supporting a dog\u2019s intestinal health and overall immune function and helping to resolve or prevent diarrhea. Species that are commonly included in probiotics include: Enterococcus faecium Enterococcus thermophilus Bacillus coagulans Bifidobacterium Certain species of Bifidobacterium bacteria are also included in the many probiotic supplements that are designed to support a healthy intestinal tract and immune system. These include: Bifidobacterium bifidum Bifidobacterium animalis But another Bifidobacterium has been shown to help dogs stay calm in situations that normally trigger anxious behaviors. Calming probiotics contain a special type of Bifidobacterium longum that goes by the proprietary name BL999. These are not the only uses of probiotics in dogs. Studies show that changing the intestinal microbiome \u201cmay impact not only GI disease, but also allergies, oral health, weight management, diabetes, and kidney disease.\u201d Prebiotics for Dogs Another way to alter a dog\u2019s intestinal microbiome is to preferentially \u201cfeed\u201d the beneficial microorganisms that are in the gut (or that we\u2019re adding with probiotic supplements). If we create a good environment for them, these microorganisms should be able to reproduce and increase their own numbers. Prebiotics are nutrients that promote the growth of beneficial gut microbes. They are a type of fiber that gut bacteria can use as an energy source. Look for any of the following on a nutritional supplement\u2019s label to determine if it includes prebiotics: Fructooligosaccharides Gum arabic Arabinogalactan Inulin Beet pulp Chicory Talk to your veterinarian if you think your dog could benefit from probiotics or prebiotics. They can point you toward the products that are most likely to help based on your dog\u2019s particular needs.\u00a0 Featured Image: iStock/Kosamtu"}]
