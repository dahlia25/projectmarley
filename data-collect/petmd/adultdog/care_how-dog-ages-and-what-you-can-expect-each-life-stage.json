Learn more about dog age and how to care for your dog at any life stage.", "articleBody": "Image via iStock.com/Kkolosov By Deidre Grieves When it comes to understanding how a dog ages, you may have heard that one dog year is equivalent to seven human years. But according to Dr. Lisa Lippman, a veterinarian based in New York City, that isn\u2019t an exact calculation for determining dog age. \u201cThe \u2018seven-year rule\u2019 is a simplified explanation of canine-human aging,\u201d she says. According to Dr. Lippman, a medium-size dog that&#039;s well cared for will live roughly 1/7th as long as their owner, but different breeds of dogs age differently. This guide will explain how a dog ages and how to best care for your dog at every life stage. Dogs Age Based on Size and Breed Dr. Lippman explains that the dog-years-to-human-years equation is actually more about weight than it is about age. \u201cA 5-year-old dog that weighs 20 pounds or less is about 33 \u2018human-years-old,\u2019 where a dog that weighs over 90 pounds is closer to 41 years old in human years,\u201d she says. The dog age ranges associated with different life stages\u2014puppy, adult and senior\u2014vary depending on the size and breed of your pup. Most dogs, says Dr. Lippman, are considered puppies until they reach approximately 1 year old. But defining the transition between adult dogs and senior dogs is a little more complicated. \u201cLarge dogs tend to age more quickly than their smaller counterparts,\u201d she says. \u201cVery large dogs may be considered seniors at 5 or 6 years of age, whereas small dogs aren\u2019t seniors until 10 or 12 years old.\u201d Because of how dogs age, small dogs and large dogs also have different life spans. Smaller dogs like Chihuahuas, Yorkshire Terriers, Dachshunds and Pomeranians tend to live longer than larger dogs such as Saint Bernards, Great Danes, Newfoundlands and Irish Wolfhounds. \u201cWhile we still aren\u2019t sure exactly what accounts for this difference in maturation and aging, smaller dogs definitely live longer, on average, than very large ones,\u201d says Dr. Lippman. \u201cThis is especially apparent when you compare very small dogs, such as a Yorkshire Terrier\u2014which can live well into their teens\u2014with very large dogs like Great Danes\u2014who live to be about 10.\u201d How to Determine Your Dog\u2019s Age While some shelters and rescues will list dog ages in their online descriptions and adoption paperwork, the age listed is usually only an estimate and is not always accurate. \u201cThe best way to age your pet is by having your veterinarian take a look,\u201d says Dr. Lippman. \u201cBetween their teeth and their blood work, we can usually give a pretty good estimation of age.\u201d Dr. Lippman says that pet parents should look at a dog\u2019s teeth for signs of discoloration. If the teeth present yellowing or decay, your dog may be on the older side. If his teeth are white and healthy looking, he\u2019s probably closer to a puppy than a senior. Gray fur\u2014especially around the muzzle and face\u2014can also indicate aging, says Dr. Lippman. Special Considerations for Each Life Stage When it comes to caring for your dog, it\u2019s important to tailor training and nutritional needs to his specific life stage. Follow these tips to make sure your dog has everything he needs for the best care. Nutrition Requirements as Dogs Age Canine dietary needs evolve as your dog ages. The dog food\u00a0he eats may need to change as he transitions from a puppy to an adult to a senior dog. \u201cPuppies require more calories and fats to sustain their growing bodies,\u201d says Dr. Lippman. \u201cAdult dogs require the right combination of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Senior dogs require fewer calories and less carbohydrates.\u201d There are age-specific dog food formulas available on the market, so make sure to consult your veterinarian about the type of food that is best for your dog and their age. For puppies, consider Purina Pro Plan Focus Puppy chicken &amp; rice formula dry dog food. Older dogs can benefit from a senior diet that focuses on joint and brain health. You can consider Purina Pro Plan Bright Mind Adult 7+ chicken and rice formula for your senior pet. Additionally, pet parents may want to talk to their vet about trying dog supplements\u00a0to support their senior pet\u2019s joint health, says Dr. Lippman. Ask your veterinarian about supplements containing ingredients like glucosamine and chondroitin, such as Zesty Paws Mobility Bites or NaturVet glucosamine DS plus MSM and chondroitin soft chews. Supplements and certain diets for senior dogs can also assist in treating canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD), says Dr. Rachel Malamed, a veterinary behaviorist located in Los Angeles. \u201cMedications, supplements and dietary therapy are often used for the treatment of CCD,\u201d she says. \u201cMany therapies contain elements such as antioxidants that decrease free radical damage in the brain, thus slowing progression of the disease.\u201d Behavioral Changes as Dogs Age It should come as no surprise that puppies and senior dogs act very differently. Age-related behavioral changes are something pet parents should be prepared for and keep an eye on. \u201cA puppy may be more likely to display unruly jumping and mouthing behavior during greetings or to solicit attention. Puppies also need to chew, but as a result, destructive chewing of items, such as a pair of shoes, is common,\u201d says Dr. Malamed. \u201cOften, these are self-rewarding or learned behaviors that are straightforward to address through positive reinforcement of desirable behaviors and offering alternate, more acceptable chewing options,\u201d says Dr. Malamed.\u00a0 To satisfy your puppy\u2019s urge to chew, Dr. Lippman suggests purchasing plenty of dog chew toys\u00a0for puppies to keep young doggy mouths busy. The KONG\u00a0puppy dog toy is a tough, stuffable dog treat toy\u00a0for young pups. Teething puppies may also benefit from teething dog toys\u00a0like the Nylabone puppy chew teething rings. While puppies will show their age with tons of energy and lots of chewing, senior dogs may also show marked differences in their behaviors. Canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD) is similar to Alzheimer\u2019s disease in humans and can show up in senior dogs as they age with a variety of symptoms, says Dr. Malamed. \u201cCCD is a neurodegenerative disease in senior dogs.\u201d she says. \u201cClinical signs are often not recognized or [are] under-reported by owners.\u201d Dr. Malamed says that pet owners should watch for signs of canine cognitive dysfunction in dogs, including: DisorientationReduced social interactionsIncreased anxiety and fearSleeping more during the dayRestlessness at nightHouse soilingPacing or wandering\u201cIt is important to know that CCD is a diagnosis of exclusion,\u201d says Dr. Malamed. \u201cThis means that in order to say that your dog has CCD, your vet must first rule out other diseases that mimic the various signs.\u201d General Care Tips for Each Life Stage To keep your pet happy and healthy at every life stage, consider the following tips. Besides providing your puppy with an outlet for chewing, \u201cI am also a big supporter of crate training,\u201d says Dr. Lippman. She recommends purchasing an adequately sized dog crate\u00a0before you even bring your puppy home. As adult dogs start to age, Dr. Lippman says that pet parents should keep a close eye on their pets to watch for changes and adjust care regimens accordingly. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be realistic about our dog\u2019s abilities as they age. Older dogs may still be spry, but extra consideration should be given to their comfort,\u201d Dr. Lippman says. She recommends investing in an\u00a0orthopedic dog bed\u00a0to help keep your senior pet comfortable. Also, dog ramps\u00a0or stairs can help your senior pet get on top of furniture or other hard-to-reach areas safely. Additionally, senior dogs may require more visits to the veterinarian throughout the year, and pet owners should be prepared for additional costs and time commitments that come with increased medical care. Dogs of all ages need enrichment, says Dr. Malamed. \u201cDogs need to use their brains to maintain function, and enrichment has been shown to improve signs of brain aging,\u201d she explains. \u201cEnrichment in the form of puzzle games, food dispensing toys, novel toys and positive reinforcement training all help to provide mental and physical stimulation.\u201d For a fun dog interactive toy, try the Trixie activity flip board interactive dog toy or the ZippyPaws Burrow Squeaky Hide and Seek plush dog toy. Dog puzzle toys, including the Pet Zone IQ treat ball dog toy or the Nina Ottosson by Outward Hound dog brick interactive dog toy, are also potential enrichment tools."}]
