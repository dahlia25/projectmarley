A dog DNA test can help you learn valuable information about your pup. Here are a vet\u2019s top picks.", "articleBody": "Have you ever questioned what breeds your mixed-breed dog is? Or wondered why your \u201cpurebred\u201d pup doesn\u2019t look as pure as you expected? Or, perhaps you are worried about what medical conditions your dog is predisposed to? A dog DNA test could give you these answers. What Are Dog DNA Tests? Dog DNA tests are tools that help you gain a deeper understanding of your dog\u2019s genetics and how specific traits are inherited from parent to offspring. There is a wide variety of dog DNA tests on the market that can tell you more about your pup. While some DNA tests require a blood sample and are performed by a veterinarian, there are also tests that can easily be done at home using your dog\u2019s saliva. At-home dog DNA tests typically provide all the necessary tools to collect a saliva sample, which can then be mailed to a lab for analysis. Knowing the results of your dog\u2019s DNA test provides you with valuable information to plan for your pet\u2019s future. For instance, knowing your dog\u2019s breed makeup will help you and your veterinarian be conscious of certain breed-related health conditions. This knowledge empowers you to be proactive in identifying and implementing any necessary preventative measures to prevent or detect conditions at an early stage. Best DNA Tests for Dogs There are many dog DNA tests, and each has a different accuracy level (typically listed as a percentage) for identifying specific factors. As these tests are not 100% accurate, there is some margin for error and some chance of an unreliable result. That said, significant progress has been made with the science and techniques involved in these tests: The accuracy for most pet DNA tests is quite high, with most well above 90%. As an example, the Embark Dog DNA test panel claims accuracy of greater than 99% for genetic-mutation tests. Wisdom Panel Wisdom Panel DNA testing uses a simple cheek swab to gather information about your dog\u2019s genetics. After mailing in the swab, you can expect to receive a comprehensive report with the results via email within three weeks. Wisdom Panel has tested over 3 million pets. Their breed identification is often the most accurate because they have the world\u2019s largest database of breeds. While Wisdom Panel DNA tests are designed for dogs of all ages, they should be conducted only after a puppy has finished nursing.
