Here&#039;s what to know before feeding your dog cashews.", "articleBody": "NOTE: Always check with your veterinarian first before giving your dog any new foods, especially \u201cpeople foods.\u201d What might be OK for one dog might not be good for your dog, depending on multiple factors, such as their age, health history, health conditions, and diet. Dogs on prescription diets should not be fed any food or treats outside the diet. Are nuts safe for dogs to eat? It depends on exactly which nut you\u2019re talking about. Some, like macadamia nuts, are toxic to pups. Others, like peanuts, are perfectly fine when properly prepped and fed in moderation. But can dogs eat cashews?\u00a0 Cashews are not toxic to dogs, but there are some things to consider before you give them to your dog as a treat. Are Cashews Bad for Dogs? Although cashews are nontoxic for dogs, they should only be eaten in moderation. Cashews contain a high amount of fat, and eating fatty foods repeatedly over time can cause obesity or pancreatitis in dogs. As with any other food\u2014especially nuts\u2014there\u2019s always a potential concern for them to be a choking hazard or cause an intestinal blockage. Thankfully, cashews are softer and more rounded than other types of nuts, such as\u00a0almonds, and they are not sold inside shells (like pistachios). This can help reduce the chances of your dog choking on cashews, but pet parents should always supervise their pup while they snack. And remember that all nuts are not the same. For example, because macadamia nuts are toxic to dogs, it\u2019s important to avoid feeding your dog mixed nuts.\u00a0 Can Dogs Eat Cashew Butter? As long as there are no dangerous added ingredients like xylitol, macadamia nuts, or nutmeg, cashew butter is safe for dogs. It\u2019s best to make a plain cashew butter at home instead of opting for the store-bought kind. That way you know exactly which ingredients are inside.\u00a0 Can Dogs Be Allergic to Cashews?\u00a0 The chance of your dog being allergic to cashews, or any other nut, is very unlikely. In fact, a 2017 study found that anaphylaxis to nuts has never been reported in dogs, despite it being a common allergic reaction in humans. However, your dog can be intolerant of the fat in the nuts, which can cause vomiting or diarrhea. But intolerance and allergies are different conditions! How Many Cashews Can Your Dog Eat?\u00a0 Any snack for a dog\u2014even healthy ones\u2014should only make up 10% of your dog\u2019s diet. The other 90% should come from a well-balanced dog food diet. Here are some general guidelines for safe feeding portion sizes.\u00a0 Keep in mind that with any diet change or addition, it\u2019s always best to consult your veterinarian about the proper portions for your individual dog\u2019s diet.\u00a0 Extra-small dog (2-20 pounds)\u00a0 Examples: Yorkies, Chihuahuas, Pomeranians, Pugs, Shih Tzus One or two cashews \u00bc tablespoon of cashew butter twice a day Small dog (21-30 pounds)\u00a0 Examples: Basenjis, Beagles, Miniature Australian Shepherds two to three cashews \u00bd tablespoon of cashew butter twice a day Medium dog (31-50 pounds)\u00a0 Examples: Basset Hounds, Border Collies, Australian Cattle Dogs, Siberian Huskies five to six cashews \u00be tablespoon of cashew butter twice a day Large dog (51-90 pounds)\u00a0 Examples: Pit Bulls, German Shepherds, Labrador Retrievers, Australian Shepherds 10-12 cashews 1 tablespoon of cashew butter twice a day Extra-large dog (91+ pounds)\u00a0 Examples: Newfoundlands, Bernese Mountain Dogs, St. Bernards, Great Pyrenees 12-18 cashews 1 \u00bd-2 tablespoons of cashew butter twice a day How to Safely Feed Your Dog Cashews If you\u2019d like to share some cashews with your pup, make sure they are completely plain. To reduce the chances of choking, chop the cashews or grind them into a powder (for a food topper) before serving. You can also feed your dog a dollop of cashew butter on a spoon or frozen into their KONG toy. Featured Image: iStock/fotyma"}]
