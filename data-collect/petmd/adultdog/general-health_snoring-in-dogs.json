Some causes of snoring in dogs are minor, but sometimes snoring is caused by serious health issues. Here\u2019s what to know about your snoring dog. Why Do Dogs Snore?  Snoring occurs when something is obstructing or restricting the airflow in a dog\u2019s nose or throat. The medical term for snoring is \u201cstertor,\u201d and there are several possible causes. Anatomy A common cause of snoring in dogs is due to the structure of their airway. Brachycephalic breeds (dogs with short faces) are the most susceptible to anatomical causes of snoring. These dogs\u2014such as French Bulldogs, English Bulldogs, Pugs, Pekingese, and Boston Terriers\u2014can have several structural deformities that enhance breathing difficulties and snoring, including: A long soft palate: The soft palate is the back of the roof of the mouth, and the long palate found in brachycephalic dogs partially blocks the opening of the windpipe. Narrow nostrils: This makes it more difficult to breathe. A narrow trachea (windpipe): As the dog breathes in, the narrow airway collapses down. This is essentially what happens to a straw when you try to drink a milkshake. Abnormal laryngeal tissue formation in the throat: This tissue sits on either side of the windpipe and blocks airflow. Allergies Allergies can cause the tissues in the airway to become swollen and inflamed. That extra swelling restricts the dog\u2019s airflow and leads to snoring. Obesity Obesity in dogs can also cause snoring (along with several other health issues). The extra fat deposits in the neck around the airway structures put pressure on the windpipe, narrowing the opening. Sleeping Position Occasionally, your dog\u2019s sleeping position can cause temporary snoring. For example, if your dog lies on his back in a way that allows the tongue to relax toward the back of the throat, it could cause snoring. Or if your dog is resting his neck on something like a stuffed toy, it could put pressure on the neck and cause snoring. Infections and Illnesses Similar to allergies, an infection or illness can cause the tissues in the airway to become swollen and inflamed. Some common ailments that can cause snoring are: Upper respiratory tract infections Kennel cough Abscesses Nasal mites Fungal infections Masses or Growths Another cause of dog snoring is a tumor or growth inside the airway that obstructs the airflow. Some growths, such as nasal polyps, are benign but can still be problematic because of how they disrupt normal breathing. Other growths can be something malignant, such as a nasal carcinoma or nasal fibrosarcoma. These block the airway the same as polyps do, but they can also spread to other areas of the body. Fluid Accumulation Exudates (masses of cells or fluid) or clotted blood can accumulate in the nasal cavity due to an illness or injury. The fluid accumulation narrows the airway and affects the normal flow of air\u2014leading to snoring. Foreign Bodies Dogs investigate the world by sniffing and smelling. But, sometimes, they accidentally snort a foreign object into their airway. These objects can cause snoring as well as other clinical signs like sneezing and nasal discharge. When Should I Be Concerned About My Dog Snoring? It\u2019s not always easy for a pet parent to know if their dog\u2019s snoring is something to worry about, but one cause for concern is if the snoring is new. This suggests a change worth investigating. Pet parents should also take note if the snoring is accompanied by other clinical signs, such as nasal discharge, sneezing, or changes in energy level. While snoring is normal for brachycephalic breeds, if it happens all the time\u2014including when your pet is awake\u2014this could be affecting your dog\u2019s ability to breathe comfortably. It also puts your pet at risk for a respiratory crisis, especially in warm weather or in times of stress. Sometimes, surgery to remove the extra tissues obstructing the airway can greatly improve your dog\u2019s quality of life. If you\u2019re worried about your dog snoring, talk to your veterinarian. They can help determine the possible causes. Giving your vet a detailed history of how the snoring started, your dog\u2019s activities when the snoring occurs, when the snoring is better or worse, and any other abnormal signs will help them identify the cause. Diagnostic tests such as X-rays, CT scans, and endoscopy help to definitively diagnose the cause of snoring. How To Stop a Dog from Snoring To help quiet a snoring dog, you need to: Remove whatever is blocking your dog\u2019s normal airflow Open up your dog\u2019s airways Adjust your dog\u2019s sleeping position A long soft palate, abnormal laryngeal tissue, foreign bodies, or tumors in the airways can usually be surgically removed, thereby improving the flow of air through the airways. If the snoring is caused by allergies or infections, treating the underlying cause of the inflammation will likely improve the snoring. Reducing any excessive weight can help alleviate the extra pressure around the neck, stopping the snoring as well. Featured Image: iStock/marcoventuriniautieri"}]
