A healthy aging supplement formulated for senior dogs and all dog life stages to help them maintain a zest for life.", "articleBody": "Healthy aging isn\u2019t just for people\u2014with a little understanding of how pets age, you can help your dog enjoy vibrant health throughout their golden years. The approach to healthy aging in dogs may sound familiar: eat a healthy diet, get plenty of exercise, and understand that your dog\u2019s nutritional needs will change as they age. The progress we\u2019ve seen in pet healthcare and wellness is allowing pets to enjoy longer, fuller lives and the benefits of supplements may further help with keeping them healthy as they age.\u00a0 How Do Dogs Age? Dogs experience age in a unique way different from humans. The common formula of dog years, where every human year equates to seven dog years, is a simplification. Dogs undergo rapid growth and aging in their early years, with significant development occurring within the first two years of their lives.However, not all dogs age at the same rate. The aging process varies dramatically based on their size and breed. Smaller breeds, such as Pomeranians and Yorkies, tend to age more slowly and may not reach geriatric status until their human equivalent of 10 years. But larger breeds like Wolfhounds and Bernese Mountain Dogs age more rapidly, often reaching a geriatric age of around 6 or 7 in human years.In veterinary medicine, we often emphasize that &quot;age is not a disease.&quot; While this is true, aging does bring certain changes and challenges. Dogs, like humans, may experience discomforts associated with aging, such as sore joints due to arthritis, slight weight gain as metabolism slows down, and cognitive decline. These changes, subtle and gradual, can be hard to notice on a daily basis. What Does Healthy Aging Mean for Dogs? When we talk about &quot;healthy aging&quot; in dogs, we refer to the process of ensuring our furry companions not only live longer, but also enjoy a high quality of life in their senior years. This involves being aware of their needs from puppyhood and consistently providing them with proper care and nutrients throughout their lives. This proactive approach is critical in helping them maintain their vitality and ensuring they continue activities they love, such as walks, playtime, swimming, hiking, and even snuggling with their favorite humans for many years to come. By offering a balanced, high-quality diet from their early years and engaging in regular physical activity, we lay a foundation for their well-being. Additionally, supplementing their diet with appropriate nutritional supplements, such as nicotinamide riboside (NR), a precursor to support nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels, can significantly contribute to their healthy aging process, allowing pets to maintain their zest for life well into their senior years. Zesty Paws\u00ae Healthy Aging Supplement for Dogs Zesty Paws\u00ae, a functional pet supplement brand, recently launched their latest product, Healthy Aging NAD+ Precursor, designed specifically to support our furry companions as they navigate through their aging process. How It Works Healthy Aging contains Niagen\u00ae, the precursor to NAD+. NAD+ is a coenzyme (meaning it helps with chemical reactions in the body) that has attracted attention among researchers who study human aging for its ability to support healthy cell function and increase cellular energy. NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is a molecule that plays a vital role in many cellular processes, like energy production, DNA repair, and circadian rhythm. NR (nicotinamide riboside) is a member of the vitamin B3 family and is the key ingredient in this new product to help optimize and support the regeneration of NAD+ levels in dogs. NAD+ plays a pivotal role in supporting cellular energy and function. By\u00a0striving to\u00a0replenish\u00a0NAD+ levels, this supplement\u00a0may\u00a0help promote cell regeneration, DNA repair, and gene expression, allowing pets to maintain their vitality and zest for life. Zesty Paws\u00ae created these Healthy Aging products to bring a touch of puppyhood back into our beloved pets&#039; lives. By providing them with this supplement, you can help your furry companions enjoy the most robust life possible. As always, consult your veterinarian before introducing any new supplements or medications to your pet&#039;s regimen, ensuring the best possible care tailored to their individual needs. The Health Benefits of NAD+\u00a0 Think of NAD+ as the fuel that powers the cellular machine. Every living being&#039;s body is made up of cells, and these cells are constantly changing, regenerating, and repairing. NAD+ plays a fundamental role in this process; it helps cells function at their most basic level and supports their ability to repair themselves.As dogs age, the natural supply of NAD+ in their bodies diminishes too. This decrease in NAD+ levels can result in slower cellular repair, making it more challenging for the body to rejuvenate itself effectively. By introducing a supplemental NAD+ Precursor to your pet, the coenzyme supports the body&#039;s natural healing mechanisms, essentially promoting a healthy aging process.Supporting the body&#039;s innate ability to heal and repair, this supplement enhances the overall well-being of your furry friend, allowing them to enjoy a more vibrant and active life as they age.In addition to its core benefits in supporting cellular repair, Zesty Paws\u00ae Healthy Aging NAD+ Precursor supplement offers a range of additional health benefits. The probiotics play a crucial role in maintaining a robust immune system by supporting a healthy gut flora and provide skeletal muscle support which may promote increased mobility in aging pets, possibly leading to improved agility and a more active lifestyle for aging pets.Finally, Healthy Aging also plays a crucial role in helping to mitigate the effects of environmental stress. By supporting cellular energy and overall health, it may help pets adapt more efficiently to changing environments. Enhanced cellular function, thanks to the NAD+ Precursor supplementation, helps equip a pet&#039;s body to cope with stressors effectively. Ease of Use Keeping pet parents in mind, the supplement is available in a convenient capsule format paired with a bacon-flavored pill wrap paste, so it can be easily added into a pup\u2019s daily routine. Before introducing any new supplement to a pet&#039;s diet, consult your veterinarian. Your vet will ensure that the supplement is a good fit for your pup and complements their overall healthcare regimen. Your veterinarian can\u00a0 guide you on proper usage and ensure your furry friend receives the maximum benefits from the Healthy Aging supplement.\u00a0 Featured Image: iStock.com/ROMAOSLO"}]
