Also referred to as summer sores or moist dermatitis are fairly common in dogs and are most often caused by a bacterial infection that results from excessive chewing or licking at the skin. Dogs do have normal healthy bacteria on their skin that rarely causes problems. But if a dog bites licks or scratches an area and causes a break in the skin surface that bacteria penetrates and sets up an infection under the skin.\n\nThis infection will manifest as a red, swollen and sometimes bruising sore on your dog's body. Bacteria thrive in moist environments so hotspots often occur when the weather is humid or they may develop after your dog goes for a swim or is exposed to the rain. A lack of grooming and matted fur can also cause hot spots to develop hot spots can happen to dogs of any breed. But they are more common in dogs with dense under coats such as Labrador retrievers German shepherds golden retrievers and colleagues.\n\nIf your dog does develop hot spots a veterinary visit is recommended your veterinarian may prescribe a topical treatment as well as oral medications to aid in the recovery. Make sure to follow your vet's instructions for daily care and monitor the healing process to make sure the hotspot doesn't worsen. Home Care may include keeping hair around the area short or shave to give the area more air and a better chance of drying out. This will help speed the healing process.\n\nYou may also use a mild water-based astringent or antiseptic spray or even a specialized shampoo and then pat dry your veterinarian may recommend the use of an e collar so that your dog cannot bite or lick at the hotspot site. The best way to keep hot spots at bay is to ensure that your dog stays groomed and clean especially during periods of warm weather. Make sure to brush your dog regularly to prevent matted fur and consider having a professional groomer trim down your dog's coat. If your dog goes swimming or spends time outside in the rain make sure to clean them off thoroughly to remove excess dirt and moisture from your dog's skin and coat.\n\nOh", "potentialAction": {"@type": "SeekToAction", "target": "https://www.petmd.com/dog/general-health/hot-spots-dogs?wtime={seek_to_second_number}", "startOffset-input": "required name=seek_to_second_number"}}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "BreadcrumbList", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 0, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.petmd.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Care & Healthy Living", "item": "https://www.petmd.com/dog/care"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "Article", "headline": "How To Treat Hot Spots on Dogs", "inLanguage": "en-US", "isFamilyFriendly": "True", "isAccessibleForFree": "True", "articleSection": "Pet Care Center", "thumbnailUrl": "https://image.petmd.com/files/styles/863x625/public/2020-11/english-bulldog-at-beach.jpg", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://image.petmd.com/files/styles/863x625/public/2020-11/english-bulldog-at-beach.jpg"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Heather Hoffmann, DVM", "url": "https://www.petmd.com/author/dr-heather-hoffmann"}, "keywords": "Dog, Hot Spots, Skin health, Adult, General health, Symptom Checker", "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "PetMD", "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.petmd.com/images/petmd_logo.png"}, "url": "https://www.petmd.com"}, "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.petmd.com/dog/general-health/hot-spots-dogs"}, "datePublished": "November 3, 2020", "dateModified": "October 7, 2023", "description": "What are hot spots on dogs? Dr. Heather Hoffman discusses one of the most common skin conditions in dogs, how to identify a hot spot and how they are treated.", "articleBody": "Out of all the possible skin conditions in dogs, hot spots are among the most common. Hot spots can have different underlying causes and treatments based on severity. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about hot spots on dogs\u2014from what they are and what causes them to how to treat and prevent them. What Are Hot Spots on Dogs? Hot spots, also known as acute moist dermatitis, are painful red areas of infected skin that appear to be irritated and are sometimes raised. Hot spots on dogs can occur anywhere on the body, but they are commonly found on the face, neck, limbs, or hips. The size and appearance of the lesions can vary slightly in each location, but most will look similar regardless of where they are. These spots can appear quickly, usually with some degree of hair loss, and become much larger in a matter of days. Hot spots on dogs can be relatively minor and heal quickly. But they do have the potential to cause more serious issues, such as widespread infection or deeper skin ulcerations. What Do Dog Hot Spots Look Like? Photo credit: Adobe/tienuskinThe actual hot spot lesion can range in size. But hot spots are usually red, inflamed, and raw, and they may bleed intermittently. The area will become moist and painful. It typically spreads due to licking, chewing, and/or scratching. Hot spots on dogs will usually look different than other skin conditions, such as\u00a0ringworm\u00a0or\u00a0mange, because the skin is very moist and inflamed. For example, ringworm (as well as some parasitic skin infections) will have associated hair loss but are usually drier in appearance compared to hot spots. What Causes Hot Spots on Dogs? Certain breeds are predisposed to skin conditions, including hot spots. Commonly affected breeds include\u00a0Golden Retrievers,\u00a0English Bulldogs, and\u00a0German Shepherds. Most hot spots on dogs are caused by an underlying condition that either causes itchiness, excessive licking, or excessive moisture. The most common conditions include: Allergies (flea allergy,\u00a0food allergy, or\u00a0seasonal allergies) Ear infections Excessive moisture from swimming Excessive licking due to boredom Poor grooming Anal gland\u00a0inflammation How to Treat a Hot Spot on a Dog While some hot spots can be treated at home, the underlying cause should always be identified, if possible, to prevent more hot spots from occurring. Hot spots on dogs can occur anywhere on the body, but they are commonly found on the face, neck, limbs, or hips.To determine the underlying cause (especially for large or overly infected hot spots on dogs), a veterinary exam is necessary. It\u2019s even more urgent if the affected area is: Increasing in size Consistently bleeding Displaying colored discharge You should also seek veterinary attention sooner if you cannot keep your pet from licking or scratching at the hot spot. What Will the Vet Do to Treat Hot Spots? Depending on the hot spot\u2019s severity, most veterinarians will treat the area with a combination of oral antibiotics, anti-itch medication, and a recovery cone. The area may be clipped and cleaned with antiseptic.\u00a0 Additional medications (such as flea prevention or allergy medication) may be necessary to treat the underlying cause. By getting your pet veterinary care as soon as possible, you can prevent further infection. Home Remedies for Hot Spots on Dogs\u00a0 If you aren\u2019t able to get to the vet right away, there are a few things you can do at home to help heal hot spots before your appointment. Human medications such as Neosporin, hydrocortisone, and Vaseline should NOT be used. Topical creams and ointments tend to cause dogs to lick the area even more, so they should be avoided if possible. Follow these steps to promote healing of the hot spot: Trim the area around the hot spot with dog hair clippers (not scissors, which make it easy to accidentally cut your pet\u2019s skin). This allows the affected area to get some air and prevent excess moisture from slowing down the healing process. Clean the skin with a mild, water-based antiseptic spray or wipe (like\u00a0Douxo Chlorhexidine 3% PS pads) or an antibacterial shampoo. Apply a veterinary-recommended hot spot treatment spray that is safe if ingested. One example is\u00a0Vetericyn Plus Antimicrobial Pet Hot Spot Spray. Place a recovery cone on your dog to help keep them from biting, licking, or scratching the hot spot. Monitor the area for improvement and signs of healing (decreased redness, less moisture, smaller lesion size). Contact your veterinarian for an exam to treat the underlying issue, and notify them if the area is not healing or is getting worse. How to Prevent Hot Spots on Dogs The key to preventing hot spots in dogs is determining the underlying cause. Your veterinarian can help you with this. But in general, it is important to: Keep your dog current on flea prevention Groom them regularly (especially after swimming) Prevent ear infections by using maintenance ear cleansers Treat allergies, if needed In some dogs, preventing boredom with interactive toys can help decrease excess licking behaviors Although it\u2019s difficult to completely prevent hot spots, these tips can help significantly reduce the risk of recurrent skin problems in dogs.
