See what vets have to say about using Dawn dish soap for fleas.", "articleBody": "You\u2019ve seen the ads where Dawn dish soap is being used to clean wild birds who\u2019ve been impacted by oil spills. If Dawn is effective and gentle enough for wildlife, you may be wondering if it can kill those pesky fleas on your cat or dog, too. While Dawn dish soap can kill fleas, it\u2019s not the most effective or efficient method, and it won\u2019t prevent flea infestations. Here\u2019s why Dawn dish soap might not be the miracle flea-killer you\u2019d hoped it would be for your four-legged family member, and why you should turn to flea and tick medications instead. How Does Dawn Dish Soap Kill Fleas? Dawn\u2019s ability to remove grease, grime, and oil from wild birds can be attributed to a chemical reaction. When soapy water is combined with oil or grease, it forms micelles (clusters of soap molecules) that trap the gunk, explains Dr. Chris Reeder, a board-certified veterinary dermatologist with BluePearl Pet Hospital in Franklin, Tennessee. To kill fleas, a completely different process occurs. Fleas have exoskeletons that allow them to float in water, explains Dr. Reeder. \u201cDawn (and other soaps like it) creates a kind of surfactant, or surface tension, that will compromise the exoskeleton and make adult fleas sink,\u201d he says. So essentially, the soap drowns the fleas. Why Can\u2019t Dawn Dish Soap Control Flea Infestations? Although Dawn kills fleas, veterinarians say it doesn\u2019t repel them or prevent infestations. Think of it as more of a temporary fix than a permanent solution. \u201cSince only a small percentage of fleas are on a pet at any given time, fleas from the environment will simply hop right back on and restart the infestation cycle,\u201d says Jennifer Coates, DVM, a veterinary writer for PetMD. Plus, flea populations can quickly grow out of control, says Dr. Reeder. \u201cOne adult flea can lay up to 50 eggs per day. Even if 10% hatch, then that would be five fleas from one female,\u201d he says. Dawn was not designed to be a flea repellent, let alone one that can control fleas for extended periods of time. To truly keep your pet flea-free, you need to keep up with regular preventative treatment. Dawn Kills Adult Fleas, But What About the Offspring? While Dawn dish soap is used primarily to kill adult fleas, says Dr. Reeder, there are three other\u00a0flea life stages\u00a0to consider. \u201cAdult female fleas lay eggs that fall into the environment. Over a period of days, they hatch, and a larval (centipede-looking) form emerges, lasts for a few days, then forms a pupa (or cocoon),\u201d Dr. Reeder says. The problem with killing just adult fleas is that you\u2019re not eradicating all those other stages. \u201cEvery time your dog or cat is outside and you [bathe them] with the soap product, you\u2019re not doing anything to really reduce the local flea population,\u201d Dr. Reeder explains. Can Dawn Dish Soap Can Irritate a Pet\u2019s Skin? Veterinarians also generally don\u2019t recommend using Dawn for fleas because of skin-related issues. \u201cFor example, if the pet already has irritation from having a number of fleas on the skin, and you\u2019re putting Dawn on skin that\u2019s already irritated, there is potential for it to worsen,\u201d says Dr. Reeder. Dawn is also not the best shampoo product for\u00a0dogs with bacterial skin infections, and it\u2019s not labeled for canine or feline use, he says. Instead, you should opt for a product designed specifically for pets, says Dr. Reeder, such as Advantage\u2122 Flea and Tick Shampoo. But even pet-specific flea shampoos are not the best fix. You should always keep your pet on year-round flea and tick prevention so they will never become infested in the first place. Should You Ever Use Dawn Dish Soap on Pets? \u201cWe will use Dawn in the rare instance that we have a severely flea-infested kitten or puppy who needs to have the fleas removed immediately,\u201d says\u00a0Dr. Susan Jeffrey, DVM, a veterinarian at Truesdell Animal Care Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin. \u201cThese pets are generally too young to use flea preventatives as recommended by the manufacturer.\u201d If you do use Dawn soap on young kittens or puppies, she recommends using a very small amount and diluting it with water. \u201cAfterward,\u00a0I&#039;d\u00a0use a\u00a0flea\u00a0comb to remove any\u00a0remaining dead and dying\u00a0fleas,\u201d she says. Dr. Reeder says it\u2019s OK to use Dawn in rare cases where your pet may have been exposed to fleas from other pets at places like boarding facilities or pet daycare. \u201c[Pet parents] could certainly use that product to help remove the fleas directly from skin and hair coat, and that would be about the only way I would use it,\u201d he says. Remember: Prescription oral and topical preventatives kill fleas and prevent infestations much more effectively and efficiently. Your veterinarian can recommend a safe and effective flea control product based on the specifics of your pet\u2019s health and lifestyle. Featured Image: iStock.com/Kanoke_46"}]
