Safety Tips for Taking Your Dog Swimming If you have a water dog, don\u2019t automatically assume they\u2019re an avid swimmer. While some dogs may naturally have a greater affinity for the water, it\u2019s important to introduce all dogs to the water gradually and under supervision. To teach a dog to swim, follow these steps: Begin in shallow water and gradually let them move deeper, letting your dog stop where they feel comfortable. Never force your dog into deeper waters before they are ready. Offer praise and positive reinforcement as your dog gains confidence in the water. Ensure your dog has an easy and accessible way to exit the water. Be cautious of stagnant water, which can harbor toxic algae, and fast-moving water that might be too strong for your pooch to handle. Always follow proper safety precautions, such as using a life vest and supervising your pup at all times. Featured Image: iStock/stevecoleimages"}]
