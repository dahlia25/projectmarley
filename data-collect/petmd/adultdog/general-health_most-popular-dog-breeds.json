Here&#039;s what to know about the most popular dogs by breed.", "articleBody": "There\u2019s a new top dog in town\u2014literally. The American Kennel Club (AKC) recently released its annual list of the most popular dog breeds, and this year\u2019s results might surprise you: for the first time in history, the French Bulldog was crowned the most popular pup. This means that, after 31 years, the Labrador Retriever is no longer the most popular dog breed in America. (Labs aren\u2019t far behind, though\u2014they placed second).\u00a0 What other dog breeds were deemed the most popular in the country? We\u2019ve got a rundown of the results, and what you can expect from each if you\u2019re looking to add one of these sought-after breeds to your home.\u00a0\u00a0 1. French Bulldog\u00a0 Photo credit: Adobe/otsphotoThe French Bulldog has been climbing the ranks in popularity over the last 10 years, according to the AKC. It\u2019s not hard to see why\u2014Frenchies, as they\u2019re often called, are easygoing, happy, compact dogs with a good-natured temperament and a bright personality.\u00a0\u00a0 They enjoy\u00a0short walks, fetch, and games of tug-of-war. Their smaller size is ideal for any type of home, which has no doubt contributed to their popularity. French Bulldogs are prone to a handful of health issues, though, including brachycephalic airway syndrome, ear infections, and back injuries.\u00a0 2. Labrador Retriever\u00a0 Photo credit: iStock/THEPALMERLabrador Retrievers are known for their affectionate nature toward everyone they meet\u2014even strangers\u2014and they do exceptionally well with children and other dogs. This breed loves the water and makes a great companion for families who spend a lot of time outdoors.\u00a0\u00a0 Labrador Retrievers love to play and are known to be highly energetic throughout most of their lives. They\u2019re a generally healthy breed, but common health issues include hip and elbow dysplasia, ear infections, and exercise-induced collapse.\u00a0 3. Golden Retriever\u00a0 Photo credit: iStock/cmannphotoAnother one of the most popular breeds is the Golden Retriever. They\u2019re considered an intelligent, loyal, easy-to-train, and very affectionate breed. Like Labs, Golden Retrievers make wonderful family dogs because they\u2019re great with young children and other pups.\u00a0\u00a0 Goldens enjoy a wide variety of activities, including running, long walks, retrieving, and swimming. They also make excellent therapy dogs and guide dogs for people with impaired vision. Golden Retrievers are usually healthy dogs, but due to poor breeding, some may have allergies, heart disease, eye issues, and hip dysplasia.\u00a0\u00a0 4. German Shepherd\u00a0 Photo credit: iStock/ChristopherBernardGerman Shepherds are large yet agile, muscular, highly intelligent, and loyal dogs. They\u2019re a breed known for their confidence, loyalty, and bravery. These pups love having a job to do, and German Shepherds are commonly used as working dogs in the military and police for patrolling, bomb sniffing, and search and rescue.\u00a0\u00a0 Although they have a long life expectancy for a large breed dog, they are prone to health issues such as gastric dilation and volvulus (which can be life-threatening). as well as cancer, allergies, and heart disease.\u202f\u00a0 5. Poodle\u00a0 Photo credit: iStock/Kurt PasAs an athletic, smart, and good-natured breed, the Poodle rounds out the top five most popular dog breeds. Their recognizable curly coat gives them their \u201chypoallergenic\u201d reputation and requires regular and consistent grooming by a professional to stay healthy and tangle-free.\u00a0\u00a0 Poodles generally have a kind and friendly personality, but they\u2019re very energetic and do best with regular exercise and training. A few health issues to keep an eye on include hip dysplasia, idiopathic epilepsy, and Von Willebrand disease.\u00a0 6. Bulldog\u00a0 Photo credit: iStock/Kenneth HornAnother identifiable breed\u2014thanks to their wide stance, muscular low profile, and flat and wrinkled face with an underbite\u2014Bulldogs often display a friendly, though stubborn, temperament. \u00a0 That stubbornness might be confused with laziness, but the breed does enjoy and benefit from daily moderate exercise. Exercise could include brisk walks and backyard games of tug-of-war, but keep all exercise out of the sun\u2014thanks to their smooshed-in face, Bulldogs can easily overheat. Bulldogs also commonly have skin and ear issues, most often due to allergies or moisture getting trapped in their adorable wrinkles. \u00a0 7. Rottweiler\u00a0 Photo credit: iStock/Peter DMoving up a spot on the most popular dog breed list, Rottweilers are loyal dogs that are eager to please their humans. They\u2019re intelligent and respond well to positive reinforcement training, but if they grow bored they can develop unwanted behaviors to entertain themselves.\u00a0\u00a0 Providing mental stimulation is important for Rottweilers. They\u2019re fans of running, hiking, dock diving, and tracking. Despite how active they are, the breed is prone to health problems including obesity and bone cancer.\u00a0 8. Beagle\u202f\u00a0 Photo credit: iStock/Tetiana GarkushaBeagles are famously led by their nose. This makes them a curious breed, but they\u2019re also loving, affectionate, and active. Their sense of smell keeps their nose to the ground, and they love wagging their tails.\u00a0\u00a0 Beagles are also very smart, but they can be stubborn and have a short attention span when it comes to training. They respond best when you tap into their food-motivated nature! Common health issues that can afflict Beagles include ear infections, obesity, allergies, and cherry eye.\u00a0 9. Dachshund\u00a0 Photo credit: iStock/TimbicusDachshunds are commonly called \u201cDoxies,\u201d or \u201cwiener dogs,\u201d and they\u2019re known for their long silhouette, short and muscular legs, brave and energetic personality, and alert nature. They\u2019re also known for being willful, headstrong, playful, and mischievous.\u00a0\u00a0 Although they\u2019re down for anything their favorite humans are doing, these pups aren\u2019t built for extensive running, jumping, or swimming\u2014all these activities can make them susceptible to injuring their long back. Instead, try activities like scent tracking, nose work, and puzzle toys.\u00a0\u00a0 10. German Shorthaired Pointer\u202f\u00a0 Photo credit: iStock/jjMiller11German Shorthaired Pointers (GSP for short) are known for their speed, agility, and endurance. They\u2019re often trained as hunting dogs and will point and signal when they\u2019re trailing a game scent by stopping and standing with their nose pointing in the direction of the scent.\u00a0\u00a0 Despite their need for adventure, they\u2019re typically a low-maintenance breed. Running, fetching, or agility games are great ways to spend time with them. But be on the lookout for health issues such as bloat, hip dysplasia, and elbow dysplasia.\u202f\u00a0 Featured image: iStock/gollykim"}]
