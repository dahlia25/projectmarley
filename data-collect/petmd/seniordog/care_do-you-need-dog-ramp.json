Here are the signs that it\u2019s time to get a dog ramp and some advice on which kind to get.", "articleBody": "By Diana Bocco Much like their human counterparts, senior dogs don\u2019t always recognize their limitations, says Dr. Travis Atkins, DVM, an emergency veterinarian and co-founder of SquarePet Nutrition. \u201cFor example, my wife\u2019s and my first \u2018child\u2019 was a Boston Terrier named Harley, who as a pup could launch herself from the ground to the middle of the bed and back down again without hesitation,\u201d says Dr. Atkins. \u201cHowever, as a decade or so passed, there were scenes reminiscent of daredevils crashing into walls as she failed to clear the height of the bed.\u201d If your older dog continues to jump like when he did when he was a puppy, it can lead to pain and even injury. \u201cRamps, stairs or ad hoc furniture placement is extremely important for any compromised dogs,\u201d Dr. Atkins says. If this sounds familiar, it might be time to look into dog ramps and pet stairs. Here\u2019s an overview of dog ramps and how to choose the right one. When Are Dog Ramps or Pet Stairs Necessary? If your pet has difficulty jumping onto things like he used to, or if he appears uncomfortable (panting, yelping or restless) once a jump is complete, a dog ramp might be a good option, according to Dr. Atkins. The same is true \u201cif your pet hesitates or \u2018lines up\u2019 excessively before jumping, or if he has been injured or has a disability where jumping will predispose him/her to serious injury\u2014or more importantly, re-injury,\u201d adds Dr. Atkins. Dog ramps\u00a0are also recommended for large breed dogs, such as Great Danes and Bernese Mountain Dogs, as well as Labs, Goldens, and other breeds that have an increased risk of joint problems, according to Colleen Demling, dog behaviorist and certified professional dog trainer at Dogtopia. Neurologist Dr. Jay McDonnell, DACVIM, agrees and recommends dog ramps for pups with neurological issues and problems that can limit their mobility, including arthritis. \u201cMany of these dogs do not have the strength in their back legs to jump up into the back of a car or truck,\u201d says Dr. McDonnell, who regularly treats pets with neurological and mobility issues.\u00a0 Dogs with a leg amputation or chronic joint problems should also use\u00a0pet ramps or pet stairs.\u00a0\u201cRamps not only make it easier for the pet to access the car or the back door; they also protect them from injury that could occur when/if the dog attempts to jump up into a vehicle or climb stairs and they fall backward,\u201d explains Dr. McDonnell. \u201cJumping out of the vehicle or leaping off the back stairs also can jar and injure the spinal cord.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 If you have a big dog that you can\u2019t physically lift into a car, teaching him or her how to use a\u00a0pet ramp is also a great idea. A set of freestanding, foldable pet stairs for large dogs can be folded up and stored in the vehicle so they are available wherever you go. \u201cYou may not need to use the\u00a0ramp on a daily basis, but if your dog suddenly gets injured or is unable to jump in or out of the car, you want to make sure you can still transport him in an emergency or take him to the vet,\u201d says Demling. Dog Ramps vs. Pet Stairs If you can\u2019t seem to decide between ramps and stairs, Demling points out that it depends on preference, but also why your dog needs help in the first place. If you\u2019re just using them to help your small dog get on and off the couch or bed, both ramps and stairs will do the trick. \u201cStairs also need less room than\u00a0ramps,\u00a0so they work great in small areas, such as next to a bed or couch,\u201d says Demling. \u201cHigh-quality stairs also tend to be less expensive than high-quality\u00a0ramps,\u00a0so they are a great option for pet parents on a budget.\u201d Foldable pet stairs can be brought out when needed but then folded up and slid under the bed when not in use so they don\u2019t clutter the room. Foldable pet stairs are also great for sofas and chairs, because they can be moved to whichever chair you want your pet to have access to. While dog ramps may take up extra space, they\u00a0are often a better choice for larger dogs. When choosing a dog ramp for your pet, it is important to make sure that you can lift and use it without a problem. \u201cIf the\u00a0ramp\u00a0is perfect for your dog, but you can\u2019t lift it into the car, then it won\u2019t be useful,\u201d Demling says. \u201cIt\u2019s also important to consider the length and width of the\u00a0ramp, as your dog will need to be comfortable walking up and down the\u00a0ramp. If you have a large dog, but the\u00a0ramp\u00a0is only a foot wide and has a huge incline, then your dog is less likely to use it. The ideal incline for a\u00a0ramp\u00a0is about 18-20 degrees.\u201d Choosing the Right Option for Your Pet \u00a0 Once you start searching for a dog ramp, you\u2019ll soon realize that there are countless options out there\u2014from different materials and thickness to quality and features offered. Whatever material you choose, Demling says you should make sure it supports the weight of your dog but is light enough that you can still move it and carry it around easily. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dr. Atkins also points out that you should consider its purpose (e.g., getting into a car, getting onto a bed or getting on or off an elevated surface) and the size, age and capabilities of both your pet and yourself. \u201cConsider the situation, the need for portability, your ability to manipulate and your preferences for style, and make the best match possible,\u201d says Dr. Atkins.\u00a0\u00a0 One important feature to look for is a top surface being labeled as non-slip. \u201cOr at least there should be horizontal slats across the\u00a0dog ramp\u00a0that the dog can use to help stabilize himself when he is walking up the\u00a0ramp,\u201d says Demling. \u201cAlso, make sure the\u00a0ramp\u00a0will lock in place and has non-skid feet; we don\u2019t want the\u00a0ramp\u00a0moving or collapsing when your dog is using it.\u201d A Few Words of Caution When choosing the location for your indoor pet stairs, make sure your dog can safely find them and use them, even in the dark. \u201cEvaluate the mental capacity and night vision of your pet. As pets age, they can become confused at night, causing them to forget the location or to not be able to see the\u00a0ramp,\u201d says Dr. Atkins. \u201cEnsure that even with the assistance of a\u00a0ramp\u00a0that they have the capability to safely climb and descend on their own.\u201d Image via Shutterstock"}]
