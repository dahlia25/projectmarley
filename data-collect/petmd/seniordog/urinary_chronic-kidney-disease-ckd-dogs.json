Dogs have two kidneys, which are vital for maintaining life\u2019s day-to-day processes. They have a variety of functions, the foremost of which is to filter and excrete toxins and waste from the body. Other tasks of the kidneys include regulating fluid, mineral, and electrolyte balance; conserving water and protein; maintaining blood pressure; and producing red blood cells.\u00a0 Many causes are associated with progressive loss of kidney function, and unfortunately, once lost the damage is irreversible. As a result, unfiltered waste products and toxins build up in the bloodstream, leading to a generalized state of nausea and malaise. When left untreated or unmanaged, a dog\u2019s quality of life suffers. Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to managing the disease and maintaining your dog\u2019s comfort and well-being. CKD is a progressive disease that has often been present for some time before it is diagnosed. It is typically classified into four stages, based on laboratory values and clinical signs: Stage I: No clinical signs are seen. Stage II: Some clinical signs are seen. Stage III: Many clinical signs are seen, and pets often feel sick. Stage IV: The majority of clinical signs are seen, often as an emergency. The quality of life for the pet is poor.\u00a0 Is Chronic Renal Failure the Same Thing as Chronic Kidney Disease? Chronic kidney disease (CKD), renal insufficiency, and chronic renal failure (CRF) are different terms often used interchangeably to describe declining kidney health\u2014where over time the kidneys become less efficient in their required tasks and the results are life-threatening. Symptoms of CKD in Dogs Dogs typically won\u2019t experience any symptoms until the kidneys have lost about 75% of their functioning capacity. The higher the stage (meaning the greater the extent of kidney disease present), the more symptoms are exhibited. Dogs in any stage can experience the following symptoms: Anemia (low red blood cell count) Changes in urine output, usually increased Decreased appetite Dehydration Increased thirst Muscle wasting Nausea Oral ulcerations (sores in the mouth) and bad breath Pale gums Poor coat appearance Sporadic vomiting Vision loss, often attributed to secondary hypertension (high blood pressure) Weakness and lethargy Weight loss Causes of CKD in Dogs Chronic renal failure by definition is a disease that occurs over a period of time; it is an ongoing, progressive, and irreversible process where, for some dogs, the cause remains unknown despite extensive testing. Often CKD develops after a serious kidney injury such as from a severe infection (e.g., leptospirosis, tick-borne disease, or pyelonephritis), heat stroke, envenomation (from a venomous bite or sting), or the ingestion of toxic substances like antifreeze, NSAIDs (ibuprofen), or certain antibiotics. CKD is also associated with certain types of immune-mediated diseases or cancer. Dogs breeds commonly prone to CKD include: Basenji Bernese Mountain Dog Boxer Bull Terrier Cairn Terrier Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Cocker Spaniel English Cocker Spaniel Shar-Pei West Highland White Terrier How Veterinarians Diagnose CKD in Dogs A veterinarian will start with a physical exam, bloodwork, and a urinalysis to look specifically at kidney values such as: Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): higher values correlated with kidney failure Calcium Creatinine (CREA): indicator of the kidney\u2019s ability to filter wastes from blood Electrolytes: sodium, potassium, chloride Phosphorous: higher phosphorus levels seen with CKD Red blood cell count: low red blood cell counts are often seen secondary to CKD Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA): an indicator used for early detection of kidney disease Urine specific gravity:\u00a0determines the kidney\u2019s concentrating ability; the more concentrated the urine is, the greater the ability of the kidneys to conserve water Your veterinarian may also recommend additional testing such as: A urine protein to creatinine (UPC) ratio to determine how much protein is lost in the urine (termed proteinuria) A urine culture, as dogs with CKD are more likely to acquire urinary tract infections A blood pressure evaluation, as dogs with CKD often have hypertension (high blood pressure) Radiographs or abdominal ultrasound to screen for kidney stones, tumors, or infarcts (areas of dead tissue) Treatment of CKD in Dogs CKD is a manageable but incurable disease\u2014since by the time dog is symptomatic, irreversible damage has already occurred. Recommendations based on the stage of CKD will be tailored to match your dog\u2019s needs, with dogs in Stage III or IV warranting greater care and therapy than dogs in Stage I or II. Common therapies for CKD include medications, diet, and fluid therapy, along with treatment for any underlying condition or inciting factors. Medications such as Cerenia\u00ae, ondansetron, or omeprazole can help aid nausea, vomiting, and lack or loss of appetite. For some dogs with more extensive needs, a feeding tube may be placed. Additionally, appetite stimulants such as capromorelin and mirtazapine may be recommended. Most vets will prescribe dietary management with a balanced diet that is lower in protein, salt, and phosphorus and is alkalinized to help combat side effects associated with CKD. Recommended diets typically include: Royal Canin\u00ae Renal Support Hill\u2019s\u00ae Prescription Diet k/d Purina\u00ae Pro Plan Kidney Function Diet NF Fluid therapy is essential. Fluids will flush out toxic waste substances that the kidneys should be doing on a routine basis and restore hydration. They can be given intravenously in the hospital or subcutaneously (underneath the skin) at home. Your dog should have access to fresh water at all times\u2014a water fountain can be an especially important item to add to your home. \u00a0 Recovery and Management of CKD in Dogs CKD is a serious lifelong condition that requires ongoing care and monitoring as symptoms continue to develop. Dogs with CKD require more frequent veterinary visits and testing than others, and at all stages of CKD, quality of life should be assessed as symptoms change. Be sure to adhere to your veterinarian\u2019s recheck guidelines and continue all medications and diet as recommended; many will be required for life.\u00a0 Depending on the circumstances, certain measures can help keep your dog comfortable and offer a good quality of life for as long as possible. Similar treatment and medications to those outlined above also are applicable for long-term management of CKD in dogs, such as: Dietary supplements such as Azodyl\u2122, a pre/probiotic, that can help decrease waste products not eliminated by the kidneys. Other supplements, such as aluminum hydroxide and Epakitin\u00aeare geared to aid with low potassium and high phosphorus. Anti-nausea and anti-emetic (anti-vomiting) medications can be prescribed as needed for dogs who experience intermittent vomiting and lack of appetite.\u00a0 Unfortunately, given the severity of symptoms often experienced by dogs with Stage III or IV and the extensive amount of care and effort they require, euthanasia may be the best option."}]
