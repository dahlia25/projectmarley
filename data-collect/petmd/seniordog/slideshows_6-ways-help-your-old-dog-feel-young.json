He might put on some weight\u2014or lose some, depending on his eating and exercise habits and his health status. \u00a0 The age at which \u201cadult dogs\u201d become \u201csenior dogs\u201d varies from breed to breed, and certainly some individuals will start to show the signs of age sooner or later than others. According to Molly Sumner, a New Jersey-based certified professional dog trainer and behavior consultant, many smaller breeds can live to 15 years and generally start to show their age between 9 and 11 years. Larger breeds have shorter life spans. They might live to just 8 or 10 years, and therefore, they become \u201csenior\u201d as early as 6 years old. \u00a0 Regardless of age, as the dog\u2019s caretaker, you owe it to him to make his golden years comfortable, healthy, and full of delight. Follow these six tips to help your older dog feel young. \u00a0 Dr. Kate Creevy, an associate professor of small animal internal medicine at Texas A&amp;M University College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, says that just like it is with our own health, the cheapest, easiest, and simplest advice is the biggest key to longer vitality. \u201cWhile it is tempting to hope for youth in a bottle, the good old-fashioned advice of \u2018eat less and exercise more\u2019 remains the best,\u201d she says. \u00a0 On the diet front, Creevy says you should begin working with your vet early in your dog\u2019s life to come up with a diet plan that\u2019s calorically and nutritionally appropriate for your pup. You should also weigh your dog regularly to make sure he\u2019s staying within healthy limits. Owners of small and medium dogs can do this at home monthly. Owners of larger breeds might need to go into the vet\u2019s office to have their dog weighed. \u201cMost practices are happy to accommodate this request outside of a scheduled appointment, and many have a scale right in the waiting room,\u201d Creevy says. \u00a0 Many older dogs will also benefit from the addition of dog supplements into their diets, Creevy says. Fish oil is perhaps the most common supplement for older dogs, and for good reason. It\u2019s an anti-inflammatory, and it has been shown to help manage certain heart problems and joint problems and improve a dog\u2019s skin and coat. \u00a0 Creevy also says that vitamin B can be good for some older dogs, but she adds that the addition of any supplements to a dog\u2019s diet should only be done after consulting with your vet. \u00a0 Because older dogs tend to have more aches and pains than puppies or adult dogs, it\u2019s important that you regulate exercise in such a way that it doesn\u2019t put unnecessary strain on your dog\u2019s musculoskeletal system. \u201cDogs who are walked for 20 minutes each day will be much more comfortable than dogs who get the same amount of weekly exercise by running after a ball for two straight hours on Saturday only,\u201d Creevy says. \u00a0 Additionally, Sumner says you may want to consider ways to shake up your walk and give your dog some mental stimulation in the process. \u201cAs a dog ages, walks that include more sniffing and exploring are more valuable cognitively than a brisk aerobic workout,\u201d she says. \u00a0 Canine cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CCDS) is a cluster of changes many dogs go through as they age that manifest themselves through loss of housetraining, loss of interest in usual activities or people, aimless wandering or pacing (especially at night), loss of normal daily rhythms, or generally seeming confused, Creevy says.\u00a0\u201cBecause we don\u2019t yet understand all of its causes and the cellular level changes that are occurring, we do not currently have specific strategies to prevent CCDS,\u201d she says. \u00a0 But keeping your dog mentally stimulated may help slow down the development of cognitive dysfunction. \u201cFood dispensing toys and puzzles, as well as scent work, can help a dog stay sharp and reduce anxiety and the effects of canine cognitive dysfunction,\u201d Sumner says. \u201cWhen it comes to [a dog\u2019s] brain, it\u2019s use it or lose it.\u201d You can buy food puzzles in most pet stores, Sumner says, or take a crack at making one of your own at home. \u00a0 \u201cLike us, aging dogs are prone to become less limber, to heal less quickly from injury, and to develop arthritis,\u201d Creevy says. \u00a0 That\u2019s especially true for sporting dogs or those who practiced agility throughout their lives. If you find your dog is less likely (or unable) to jump up on the couch next to you, you might want to consider taking him to a veterinary physical therapist. \u201cThey have inflatable exercise equipment you and your dog can use,\u201d Sumner says. \u201cThey\u2019ll also teach you stretches to do with your dog.\u201d \u00a0 Not only will these visits and stretches make your dog feel more limber, they might also help with behavior problems that emerge as he gets older. Sumner adds that negative changes in personality\u2014like fear, aloofness, and hiding\u2014might emerge because your dog is dealing with untreated pain.\u00a0 \u00a0 Certain physiological changes that come with advanced age\u2014like losing sight or hearing\u2014can bring about changes that make your pup seem like he\u2019s becoming a grumpy old dog. If your veterinarian says that there\u2019s not really anything you can do to reverse these changes, Sumner says it\u2019s very important to help your older dog navigate your home and yard and more closely monitor interactions with people and other animals. \u00a0 You also shouldn\u2019t force your dog to play with you if he doesn\u2019t want to. \u201cIf your dog seems to be withdrawing more than usual, he might be protecting himself from pain,\u201d she says. \u201cIf he\u2019s always been super social, he might continue that way as a senior, but dogs that seem more aloof or reclusive shouldn\u2019t be pressured to come out and play.\u201d If you suspect that a medical problem might be causing your dog\u2019s behavior changes, make an appointment with your veterinarian. \u00a0 If you\u2019re unsure, take it slow. \u201cYou know your dog and his body language better than anyone,\u201d Sumner says. \u201cIf he\u2019s giving off signs that he doesn\u2019t want to be pet right now, you have to respect his wishes.\u201d"}]
