He\u2019ll still be your best friend, of course, and the vacuum will always be Public Enemy Number One. But just like with humans, his health needs won\u2019t be the same. One major area pet parents should be aware of as the years go on? Food and nutrition. We asked the experts what to look out for and what you may need to adjust for your senior pup. As always, consult with your own veterinarian before making any changes to your pet\u2019s diet\u2014each dog is unique. \u00a0 If you notice your senior dog is having a hard time eating his kibble, you may be wondering what to feed an old dog that won&#039;t eat. But, it may not be his diet at all. Dental disease and tooth pain may very well be to blame for your senior dog&#039;s lack of appetite. While switching to a softer food may seem to help, it\u2019s crucial to actually address the root of the problem. \u201cProper dental care can greatly enhance an older dog\u2019s life,\u201d says Dr. Heather Frankfurt, a Texas-based veterinarian who sees many senior dogs with advanced dental disease. \u201cImagine having a tooth ache, or many, for several years!\u201d \u00a0 If your dog has stopped eating, however, it\u2019s very unlikely that dental disease is solely to blame\u2014Frankfurt notes that most pets will figure out a way to eat through tooth pain. As with all changes to eating patterns, a visit to your veterinarian is in order. \u00a0 Just as senior humans experience joint trouble, your dog is at risk of arthritis and pain. And while plenty of commercial dog food is\u00a0formulated to support joint health, an additional dog supplement may be appropriate. Frankfurt recommends that dogs over the age of 7 take a joint supplement; for larger breeds, this age could be even earlier. \u201cThere are many brands and types of joint supplements available, and it can become overwhelming to choose one,\u201d she says. \u201cLook for a product that contains MSM, chondroitin, and glucosamine\u2014when combined, these ingredients promote healthy joints.\u201d \u00a0 What to know what the best diet for senior dogs is? Consider one with antioxidants. \u00a0 Antioxidants are prized for their ability to fight disease and the effects of aging. They\u2019re front and center at your trendy juice bar, and can be a healthy addition to your dog\u2019s bowl as well, under the guidance of a veterinarian. \u201cIf they\u2019re acting aged, they usually need antioxidants, in my view,\u201d says Dr. Susan G. Wynn, a veterinary nutritionist. \u201cOne of the best ways to do this is to supplement fruits and veggies, but some dogs don&#039;t tolerate them or won&#039;t eat them. In that case, I will prescribe an antioxidant combination in capsule form.\u201d If your pup is open to it, consider adding berries, turmeric, and dark leafy greens\u00a0to his senior dog diet. \u00a0 Known to boost the immune system and reduce inflammation, omega-3 fatty acids are good for you and your aging pup. Want to reap the benefits? Consider adding fish to food for older dogs. \u201cSenior pets require higher levels of omega-3s for brain and heart health,\u201d says Dr. Judy Morgan, a veterinarian certified in food therapy. \u201cI use sardines, due to the higher heavy metal contamination in larger fish.\u201d Fish oil supplements are another option to increase omega-3s in your senior dog\u2019s diet. It is possible to get too many fatty acids, however, so be sure to consult with your veterinarian. \u00a0 A healthy weight makes for a healthy pup at any age. When seniors slow down, it\u2019s especially important to keep an eye on that scale\u2014extra weight is just as dangerous for our pets as it is for us. \u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s just so easy to give an extra treat or fill up the food bowl a little bit more\u2014food makes our pets so happy,\u201d says Frankfurt. \u201cHowever, obesity is something I take quite seriously because of the toll it takes on our pets\u2019 bodies.\u201d \u00a0 So what can you do? Start with the basics, says Frankfurt. Measure precisely how much food you give at each meal, and never allow your dog to free-feed throughout the day\u2014a constantly full\u00a0dog bowl is a fast pass to obesity. Instead, feed your pet at designated intervals at least twice a day to keep him feeling satisfied. If he eats too quickly, consider a \u201cbusy bowl\u201d or food puzzle to stretch out mealtime and help him get the most enjoyment out of those calories. \u00a0 Your dog loves them, and you love giving them to him. But unfortunately, commercial treats are calorie bombs and can undo all the work you\u2019ve done portioning out breakfast and dinner. Fresh fruits and veggies are just as rewarding\u2014you just have to condition your dog to see them as dog treats. \u00a0 \u201cI always recommend that pet owners introduce veggies and fruits to their pets at as young an age as possible,\u201d says Wynn. \u201cThey\u2019re the healthiest treats we can use. If you teach the dog early that a vegetable is good, then veggies are treats to them.\u201d \u00a0 For easy rewards, consider small apple slices (without seeds), pear slices, blueberries, mini carrots, or for a cold treat\u2026 frozen green beans. \u00a0 If you\u2019ve ever dieted, you know how it works\u2014a big leafy salad will keep you feeling full longer than that small side of fries. When the pounds creep up, switch your pup to a weight-loss formula that\u2019s bulked up with healthy, low-calorie fiber. \u201cThat way, they\u2019re still receiving nearly the same amount of kibble, but it\u2019s not as calorie-dense,\u201d says Frankfurt. Pet foods that are marketed for senior dogs often have a reduced caloric density as well as higher levels of antioxidants, omega-3s, and other ingredients that can help pets as they age. As always, consult with your veterinarian before making any changes to your canine companion\u2019s diet. \u00a0 When was the last time you bought a new food bowl? Was it during puppyhood? If so, it may be time to upgrade to something more senior-friendly. For dogs with joint trouble, Frankfurt recommends a raised bowl to reduce the need to bend, keeping mealtime as comfortable as possible. And while you\u2019re at it, put those bowls through the dishwasher\u2014we have a tendency to forget this chore."}]
