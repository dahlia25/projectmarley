Dr. Tiffany Tupler, DVM, explains how to help dogs with arthritis.", "articleBody": "Arthritis in dogs is a condition that causes joint pain, and one that\u00a0will afflict most dogs as they age. Watching your best friend get older is never fun, but there are some things you can do around your home and in collaboration with your veterinarian to help dogs with arthritis manage their pain and improve their joint health. Here are some tips for relieving your dog\u2019s joint pain and reducing inflammation. Modify Your Home to Accommodate Dogs With Arthritis Making a few basic modifications to your home can help alleviate your dog\u2019s pain and anxiety. Nonslip Rugs Dogs with arthritis and joint pain may have a fear of walking on slippery surfaces like hardwood or tile because they have limited mobility and they expect to feel pain if they fall. Using nonslip mats, rugs, and carpets on slippery floors can help your dog get around the house more without the fear of slipping. Placing nonslip rugs at the base and the top of staircases, and near couches and beds, will help decrease dog joint pain by lowering the impact on their joints. Orthopedic Dog Beds Comfortable dog beds that are low to the ground and have orthopedic support will ease your dog\u2019s joint pain and allow them to get back up without struggling. Make sure that your pet\u2019s favorite spots to rest and sit have thick bedding with nonslip mats to prevent injury or pain when they try to stand up. Blocked-Off Stairways Stairs should be blocked off with a pet gate to ensure your dog\u2019s safety when they\u2019re not under your direct supervision. Dog-Lift Harness Considering purchasing a sling, or dog-lift harness, to assist with mobility around the house. This type of harness can help ensure proper and safe movement through certain areas for pets severely affected by hip, knee, shoulder, and elbow arthritis. Ask Your Vet About Joint Supplements and Medications Using a multimodal approach\u2014combinations of different types of medications and joint supplements\u2014to treat arthritis in dogs is the best way to ensure quality of life and successful treatment. NSAIDS Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) play a major role in controlling dog joint pain and inflammation. Prescription medications such Galliprant, Carprofen, and Meloxicam are the safest options for controlling pain and inflammation compared to over-the-counter, non-veterinary products. You may see the full results after three months of daily use. Speak with your veterinarian about which product and dosage is right for your pet. Adequan Injections Adequan, an FDA-approved series of injections performed by your veterinarian, has shown to help with inflammation and to increase joint lubrication. Joint Supplements and Diets Oral supplements that contain methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), glucosamine hydrochloride, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids\u2014eicosatetraenoic acid (ETA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)\u2014and chondroitin sulfate are known for supporting dog joint health. Quality products formulated specifically for dog joint health include Nutramax Dasuquin, Hill&#039;s Prescription Diet j/d dry dog food, Hill\u2019s Prescription Diet j/d wet dog food, Bayer\u2019s Free Form, and Nutramax Welactin, among many others. Many oral supplements can have significant side effects, wreaking havoc on the gastrointestinal tract of our canine friends, so you should consult with your veterinarian before adding them to your dog\u2019s diet. Dog Breeds That Can Benefit From Joint Supplements as Puppies In breeds that have the potential for joint disease, it is recommended to start joint supplements as early as 8 weeks of age.\u00a0These breeds are most commonly at risk for joint issues:\u00a0 Hip and knee: Any toy to giant breed dog can be affected, but these are the most common:\u00a0 Toy breeds:\u00a0Miniature Poodles, Boston Terriers, Chihuahuas, Pugs (knee), and Yorkshire Terriers Medium to large breeds:\u00a0American Staffordshire Terrier, Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, Boxers, American Bulldogs, English Bulldogs, German Shepherds, Mastiffs\u00a0 Giant breeds:\u00a0Great Danes, St. Bernards\u00a0 Elbow (tends to be breed-specific): English Bulldogs, Welsh Corgis, Dachshunds, Golden Retrievers, Labrador Retrievers Shoulder (tends to be breed-specific):\u00a0Labradors and Golden Retrievers Consider Secondary Therapies These treatments can be used in conjunction with primary treatments to help relieve dog joint pain. Acupuncture Acupuncture is the insertion of thin needles into the skin at certain points of the body. There is clinical evidence that acupuncture, in combination with a multimodal therapy approach to arthritis, reduces chronic dog joint pain. Speak with your veterinarian to determine if acupuncture is a good option for your pet. Managing Your Dog\u2019s Weight Weight management is a critical component of relieving dog joint pain. Obesity contributes to increased pressure on the joints, which leads to pain and discomfort. Controlling your dog\u2019s weight can help ease their pain as they age. Speak with your veterinarian about the ideal weight for your pet and long-term weight management. Moderate Exercise and Physical Therapy Physical therapy, massage, and daily exercise can be very beneficial to dogs with arthritis. Consider daily exercise in moderation: Start with short walks, up to 10 or 15 minutes, three to four times per day. Following the same routine every day without high-impact activities (such as ball chasing, running, or jumping) is key to giving your dog some exercise without increasing stress or pain. Speak with your veterinarian about consulting a certified small animal physical rehabilitation practitioner. They can lead your dog through therapeutic exercises like passive stretching, range of motion exercises, controlled walking with obstacles, and using underwater treadmills.
