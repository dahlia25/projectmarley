Without water, your dog\u2019s body will not function properly. More specifically, your dog will\u00a0dehydrate. This can happen if your dog isn\u2019t getting enough water, which is why you should clean and refill your dog\u2019s water bowl daily. You also need to be aware of when your dog is drinking more water than usual, as this could be a sign of illness. So how much water should a dog drink?

There are several ways to estimate how much water an individual dog needs, and this tend to vary due to individual circumstances. In general, dogs should drink approximately 1 ounce of water (1/8 of a cup) per pound of body weight each day. However, there are many factors that can affect how much your dog will drink, so you should not be restricting your dog\u2019s water intake. Unless directed by your veterinarian, it\u2019s not necessary to measure out the exact water amounts your pet drinks. Just make sure that your dog has plenty of fresh, clean water every day. Why Your Dog Might Drink Less Water Sometimes Here are a few common reasons why a dog might be drinking less water than usual. Your Dog Is Eating Wet Food or a Homemade Diet Dogs that are fed a canned food or a homemade diet will receive some moisture through their food, as these are about 65-80% water. You might notice that your dog drinks less than when eating only dry kibble on a daily basis. Your Dog May Be Sick or in Pain If your dog is sick from another underlying cause, or has mobility or pain issues, they also might not drink the amount of water they need. Talk with your veterinarian to figure out why your dog is not drinking enough water and how you can help. Your Dog Is Hot or Exercising Depending on the temperature and the amount of exercise your dog does, more water may be necessary. This is because water is lost with excessive panting and salivation.

However, if you live in a place with unsafe tap or well water, please discuss options with your veterinarian for providing bottled or filtered water for your dog.

Organs will eventually become damaged with sustained water deficiency, and if it lasts long enough, the kidneys, liver, and other organs will begin to shut down. Death will follow shortly after.\u00a0 \u00a0 In general, a healthy dog will drink enough water daily to stay well hydrated, but there are a few instances where\u00a0dehydration\u00a0can occur.

If you notice your dog drinking or urinating more than usual, let your veterinarian know. There are many causes for this problem, since many disease processes show this symptom. A thorough physical examination along with blood or urine tests can help direct your veterinarian\u2019s next steps. You might be asked to measure your pet\u2019s water intake; in which case, you may need to separate them from other pets. You should still provide an excess amount of water, but measure how much you add to the bowl and how much is left at the end of each day, plus any that\u2019s added to your dog\u2019s meals, so you can estimate the total amount of water that your dog drinks in a day. How Often Should You Clean the Water Bowl? Water and food bowls should be scrubbed with soap and water daily. Since these bowls are in contact with food and your pet\u2019s saliva, they tend to be good places for bacteria to grow. Bowls should be smooth and easy to clean, without nooks and crannies or even scratches where bacteria can hide and survive.

Maintaining proper hydration is too important to your dog\u2019s health to ignore. Featured Image: iStock.com/alex_ugalek"}]
