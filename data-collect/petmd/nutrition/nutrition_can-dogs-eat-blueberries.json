Get the info on whether your pup can eat blueberries safely and how many they can have as a snack.", "articleBody": "NOTE: Always check with your veterinarian first before giving your dog any new foods, especially \u201cpeople foods.\u201d What might be okay for one dog might not be good for your dog, depending on multiple factors, such as their age, health history, health conditions, and diet. Dogs on prescription diets should not be fed any food or treats outside the diet. Blueberries are a great snack choice for most dogs and puppies. They are bite-sized superfoods with numerous health benefits. Check out the advice below to find out how many blueberries dogs can eat, tips on what to be careful of, whether dogs can have certain foods containing blueberries, and other important feeding tips.\u00a0 Are Blueberries Good for Dogs? Blueberries are safe fruits for dogs to eat, and they also provide many nutritional benefits. Blueberries are known for their disease-fighting properties, called phytochemicals, that battle things like cancer and heart disease. They also provide antioxidants and vitamin C. Blueberries are also low in calories and high in fiber. They help prevent cell damage, can improve night vision, and can even help promote mental function in senior pets. Here\u2019s a list of the vitamins and minerals in blueberries: Vitamin C Vitamin A Vitamin K Calcium Phosphorus Potassium Magnesium Can Blueberries Be Bad for Dogs? Typically, no. Blueberries aren\u2019t bad for most dogs. However, if your dog has diabetes, has food sensitivities, or is on a prescription diet to manage a medical condition, they should not be fed high-sugar fruits such as blueberries. There is also a potential choking hazard with blueberries if you have a small dog, or if you give your dog frozen blueberries.\u00a0 And even though blueberries are healthy, too much of anything can give your dog an upset stomach\u2014especially when there\u2019s sugar involved. Organic blueberries are always best, but be sure to thoroughly wash them before feeding them to your dog. Wild blueberries are also safe for dogs, but don\u2019t let them eat an excessive amount. And make sure they are actually blueberries, as certain other wild berries can be poisonous for dogs.\u00a0 Can Dogs Have Blueberry Muffins? If you\u2019re thinking about sharing your blueberry muffin, don\u2019t. It\u2019s not healthy for your dog. Although dogs can eat blueberries, they shouldn\u2019t eat all the extra sugars and fats that are in foods like muffins. And depending on the ingredients, there could be something toxic to your dog in the muffin such as chocolate, xylitol, or nutmeg.\u00a0 If your dog eats a small piece of a blueberry muffin that fell on the floor, they should be fine. But if the muffin did contain any ingredients that are toxic to dogs, or your dog happened to sneak a whole pan of muffins, contact your veterinarian immediately. Can Dogs Have Blueberry Yogurt? Blueberry yogurt purchased at the store isn\u2019t a good choice for your dog either. It will probably have a high sugar content, and too much sugar can upset your dog\u2019s stomach. Over time, too much sugar can also cause obesity and diabetes, and it may lead to cavities. Blueberry yogurt could also contain xylitol, which is toxic to dogs. Instead, try mixing a handful of blueberries with a plain, sugar-free, xylitol-free yogurt. Give a little bit to your dog as a special treat.\u00a0 If your dog eats blueberry yogurt and you know it contains xylitol, contact your veterinarian immediately.\u00a0 Can Dogs Eat Dried Blueberries? Dried blueberries can be a great way for you and your dog to have a healthy snack. But the best way to do this is by drying them at home with a dehydrator.\u00a0 Store-bought dried blueberries often contain preservatives, as well as a very high sugar content. That isn\u2019t healthy for your dog and could cause stomach problems. Check the nutrition facts and ingredients list first to see what has been added to the fruit.\u00a0 How Many Blueberries Can Dogs Eat? Even though blueberries are very healthy, they should only be given to dogs in small portions. Treats of any kind should only make up 10% of your dog\u2019s overall diet. The other 90% should come from a well-balanced dog food.\u00a0 Here are some general guidelines for feeding blueberries to your dog: Extra-small dogs (2-20 lbs.) = 1-2 blueberries\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Examples: Yorkies, Chihuahuas, Pomeranians, Pugs Small dogs (21-30 lbs.) = 2-3 blueberries\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Examples: Basenjis, Beagles, Miniature Australian Shepherds Medium-size dogs (31-50 lbs.) = 3-5 blueberries\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Examples: Basset Hounds, Border Collies, Australian Cattle Dogs Large dogs (51-90 lbs.) = 5-6 blueberries \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Examples: Pit Bulls, German Shepherds, Labrador Retrievers, Australian Shepherds Extra-large dogs (91+ lbs.) = small handful of blueberries \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Examples: Newfoundlands, Bernese Mountain Dogs, St. Bernards, Great Pyrenees If you\u2019re concerned that your dog may have eaten too many blueberries, watch for signs of an upset stomach.
