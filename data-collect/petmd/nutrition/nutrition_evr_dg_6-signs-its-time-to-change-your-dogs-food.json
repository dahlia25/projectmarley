Not good, says Dr. Jessica Vogelsang.", "articleBody": "Choosing a dog food can be a painstaking process \u2014 so much so that some of us stick with buying the same pet food for our dog\u2019s entire life. \u201cThe truth is,\u201d says Dr. Jessica Vogelsang, \u201cwe now know our pet\u2019s dietary needs can and do change over time due to factors like their life stage, their overall health, and their activity level.\u201d What Age Should I Change My Dog\u2019s Food? When it comes to nutrition, there are three life stages which experts believe are important times in your dog\u2019s life to discuss with your veterinarian. The first is the puppy life stage. During this period a dog food rated for \u201cgrowth\u201d is needed because it is specifically designed for puppies and kittens according to the AAFCO (Association of American Feed Control Officials, which sets standards for pet foods in the United States). \u201cPuppies and kittens that are growing require pet foods with a higher protein level and a higher calorie count\u2026to meet their growth requirements,\u201d says Dr. Lorie Huston. \u201cIf these nutritional demands are not met, your pet\u2019s growth may be stunted and/or your pet may become ill.\u201d Pet foods rated for \u201creproduction&quot; or &quot;gestation/lactation\u201d are also a benefit for pregnant or lactating females. The second life stage for which you should consult your veterinarian about dietary changes is the adult life stage. \u201cObesity is the most common nutritional disease seen in both dogs and cats today,\u201d says Dr. Huston. \u201cOne reason for this is improper life stage feeding. For example, [an adult] dog or cat \u2014 especially one that leads a sedentary lifestyle \u2014 may become overweight or even obese if fed pet food meant for puppies or kittens.\u201d Pet food labeled as &quot;all life stage&quot; can also deliver excessive fat and nutrients your adult pet does not require, as it is formulated for kittens and puppies. Instead you should be looking for dog food rated \u201cadult maintenance\u201d by the AAFCO. The third life stage to be mindful of is the senior life stage. Senior pets often have medical issues that may benefit from dietary changes. For example, a veterinarian may recommend a pet food that contains glucosamine and/or fatty acids such as DHA and EPA for senior dogs with mobility issues. According to Dr. Huston, feeding the appropriate pet food can also sometimes be an effective method to manage diseases like chronic kidney disease and heart disease. The AAFCO does not have a senior life\u00a0stage, so look for a pet food with an adult maintenance statement for your senior dog. What are other Signs it\u2019s Time to Change My Dog\u2019s Food? In addition to consulting with your veterinarian about nutrition as your dog undergoes changes in life stage and lifestyle, it\u2019s vital to watch out for certain visible signs a change in diet is needed. Here are six common signs you\u2019ll want to be wary of\u2026 1. Dull, Flaky Coat Diets rich in essential fatty acids are a key component in keeping a dog\u2019s skin healthy, and therefore his or her coat, in tip-top shape. Many dog foods are designed with skin and coat improvement in mind. Look for a diet containing both Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids to make your dog\u2019s coat shiny and bright in no time. 2. Lethargy/Weakness If your dog had recently undergone a stressful event, illness, or surgery, he may understandably be a little worn out. Diets with high levels of antioxidants can help boost the immune response to accelerate your dog\u2019s recovery and get them back on their feet in no time. Remember: a dog who is suddenly acting lethargic and weak should be evaluated by a veterinarian before making dietary changes. 3. \u2018Senioritis\u2019 Depending on the size of the animal, pets are considered middle-aged to senior around 5-7 years. And as our dogs age, their nutrient requirements change too. Senior diets, for example, are generally lower in calories but higher in fiber, and often have supplements specific to this life stage such as joint support and antioxidants. Forgo \u201call life stage\u201d pet food for senior pets, says Dr. Vogelsang. It is formulated with kittens and puppies in mind and will deliver excessive \u201cfat and nutrients your senior pet does not require\u201d. \u00a0 4. Hefty Midsection It doesn\u2019t take much for a pet to wind up with some extra weight on their frame \u2014 and this is particularly noticeable with small dogs. \u201cIf your pet needs to lose a few inches,\u201d says Dr. Vogelsang, \u201ca diet specifically designated for weight loss will ensure that they still have the proper amount of essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals while ingesting fewer calories.\u201d These diets take advantage of the latest research in pet weight management to ensure your dog is on their way to a healthier weight in no time! If your dog is extremely overweight or obese, however, it&#039;s best that you consult with your veterinarian for a therapeutic nutritional solution. 5. GI Disturbances \u201cChronic flatulence, loose stool, or rumbly stomachs can be the result of food intolerance or the low quality of food that you\u2019re feeding your pet,\u201d says Dr. Vogelsang. GI upset is an inconvenience to owners as well as being uncomfortable for your pet. Consult with your veterinarian as the solution may be as easy as switching to premium dog food or a sensitive stomach diet that\u2019s right for your pet. 6. Itchy Dog Allergies are common in pets, and food is just one of several possible causes. Regardless of the cause, though, allergic pets may benefit from a low-allergen diet that reduces the amount of potential allergens they are exposed to. Your veterinarian can recommend either a prescription diet or an over the counter sensitive skin diet, depending on your pet\u2019s particular needs. Plan for Success Choosing the proper diet is one of the most important ways to ensure your dog\u2019s long-term health, but it\u2019s no substitute for medical care. If you suspect your dog may benefit from a new diet, consult a veterinarian! Good food and good choices lead to a long, healthy, happy life.
