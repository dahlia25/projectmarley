Dogs on prescription diets should not be fed any food or treats outside the diet. Sweet potatoes are a nutrient-packed staple for us humans. But what about our canine companions? If your dog is giving puppy dog eyes for your favorite Thanksgiving side, you may wonder if dogs can eat sweet potatoes.\u00a0\u00a0 Good news: vets give the OK when it comes to dogs and sweet potatoes! In fact, sweet potatoes are considered a healthy treat for dogs and offer lots of nutritional value for your pooch. Just be careful how you go about introducing this fiber-rich starchy root to your pooch. Even though dogs can eat sweet potatoes, don\u2019t just toss them any old yam to gnaw on! Keep the following tips top of mind in order to safely feed your dog sweet potato.\u00a0 Are Sweet Potatoes Good for Dogs?\u00a0 Sweet potatoes can be a nutritional treat for our canine companions when fed in small amounts. This vitamin-rich carbohydrate is even becoming a common ingredient in commercial dog food and treats. As long as you watch out for extra ingredients that can sneak into human recipes (like butter, sugar, and molasses) and don\u2019t offer too much, these starchy root veggies are considered a safe dog treat. Here are a few reasons sweet potatoes are considered a healthy snack for dogs: High in fiber: Sweet potatoes are a good source of dietary fiber, which helps dogs with digestion. These special spuds are also considered a \u201ccomplex carbohydrate,\u201d meaning they provide a steady source of energy. Good source of beta-carotene: Like other orange veggies (such as carrots), sweet potatoes contain high amounts of beta-carotene, which the body turns into vitamin A. Vitamin A helps dogs\u2019 eye health, immune function, and cell growth. Vitamins and minerals: Sweet potatoes are also a good source of other vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, manganese, potassium, and iron. Low glycemic index: As a source of carbohydrates, sweet potatoes have a relatively low glycemic index, which means they\u2019re less likely to cause a spike in your dog\u2019s blood sugar. This can be beneficial for dogs with diabetes. Antioxidants: Sweet potatoes contain antioxidants that may help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals.\u00a0 Can Dogs Eat Cooked Sweet Potatoes? Cooked sweet potatoes are fine for your dog to enjoy as an occasional treat. Just be sure to avoid other ingredients that us humans like to add to our sweet potatoes, such as butter, cream, or salt, which can be dangerous for dogs to eat (and even cause pancreatitis in dogs). Sweet potatoes that have been prepared with salt, sugar, garlic, or other seasonings that are not safe for dogs to consume should also be avoided. As with any new food that finds its way into your dog\u2019s bowl, moderation is key.\u00a0 Can Dogs Eat Raw Sweet Potatoes? While cooked, unseasoned sweet potatoes are fine in moderation, don\u2019t feed your pooch raw sweet potatoes. Uncooked sweet potatoes are difficult for them to chew and can be a choking hazard. They can also cause an upset stomach.\u00a0 Can Dogs Eat Sweet Potato Skins? Potato skins are not considered safe for dogs to eat because their chewy exterior can cause dogs to choke and even lead to intestinal blockages. Be sure that any sweet potato offered to Fido is cooked and that the skins (along with any stems or leaves) are removed before they find their way into your pet\u2019s food bowl. How to Safely Feed Sweet Potatoes to Your Dog Whether they\u2019re mashed, baked, or boiled, sweet potatoes are fine for dogs to eat as long as they\u2019re cooked, peeled, and plain. Again, avoid any seasonings or extra ingredients that may be included in \u201chuman food\u201d recipes, such as butter, sugar, or salt. For a little extra flavor (and fiber), try topping your dog\u2019s regular food with a little sweet potato pure\u00e9 at mealtime. Or add a spoonful to their Kong or other food puzzle to keep their brains busy as they snack. Sweet potato is easy to mix in with other dog-friendly ingredients, and most dogs enjoy the taste.\u00a0 Just be sure not to overdo it! Treats (including veggies like sweet potatoes) should only make up 10% of your dog\u2019s overall calories. The other 90% should be from a diet of well-balanced dog food.\u00a0 How Much Sweet Potato Can a Dog Eat?\u00a0 When feeding your dog cooked, plain sweet potato, start slow\u2014the high fiber content in sweet potatoes may cause gastrointestinal upset. See how your pup reacts to a small amount before giving them a full serving size.
