Dogs on prescription diets should not be fed any food or treats outside the diet. Watermelon is a healthy and refreshing treat for humans, but can dogs eat it, too? If you\u2019ve shared a piece of watermelon or your pup has snuck a piece, there\u2019s no need to worry.

Both red and yellow watermelon are safe and healthy fruits for most puppies and adult dogs to eat. However, dogs that have diabetes or sugar sensitivities as well as dogs that are obese should not be given the fruit. Watermelon is low in calories and contains no fat or cholesterol.
