Learn how to calculate calories and find the best dog food for weight loss to help your pup reach their target weight.", "articleBody": "Today, pudgy pups are becoming the norm in many U.S. households. According to the\u00a0Association for Pet Obesity Prevention\u00a0(APOP), an estimated 56% of dogs are overweight or obese. Because obesity in dogs is associated with a host of medical ailments\u2014from\u00a0diabetes\u00a0and\u00a0osteoarthritis\u00a0to\u00a0heart disease\u00a0and cancer\u2014it\u2019s important to find the best dog food for weight loss to complement your pet\u2019s weight-loss plan. How to Put a Dog on a Diet To get your dog on a weight-loss diet, you\u2019ll need to determine their target weight, calculate their recommended calorie intake, choose the best dog food for weight loss, establish a feeding routine, and work toward reaching their target weight. Calculating Your Dog\u2019s Calorie Intake and Target Weight For otherwise healthy dogs, most veterinarians will calculate the calories your dog needs with a maximum goal of losing 2% of initial body weight per week. Depending on a number of factors, a loss of 0.5% of initial body weight per week can be used as the minimum desired rate of weight loss. Your veterinarian will also determine your dog\u2019s target weight and the amount of time needed to reach this goal. Then your veterinarian can suggest the best dog food for weight loss, explain ways to determine how much to feed, and schedule regular weigh-ins. Often, the weigh-ins will be scheduled every two weeks for the first two months of weight loss. Your dog\u2019s diet will be adjusted based on how they\u2019re doing. Once your dog\u2019s target weight is achieved, a new feeding plan will be initiated with the best weight-management dog food to stabilize your dog\u2019s body weight. Choosing the Right Dog Food for Weight Loss Weight loss happens when the calories your dog is taking in (through food and treats) are less than the calories expended (through exercise and maintenance needs). Pet parents are responsible for what dogs eat and have control over the calories they take in. Prescription weight-loss diets are incredibly effective in the battle of the bulge.\u00a0Several components to look for in a weight loss diet include: Nutrient and caloric density High fiber, low fat L-carnitine levels Antioxidants Nutrient and Caloric Density The value of choosing a diet formulated specifically for weight loss\u2014and not \u201cweight control\u201d or \u201cweight management\u201d\u2014is related to two factors: Calories in a set serving of dog food Nutrients in that same serving Diets formulated for weight loss in dogs are designed to decrease caloric intake (so weight loss occurs) while also maintaining appropriate nutrient levels and not inducing nutritional deficiencies. If you simply feed less of a regular or weight maintenance food, your dog may not get the necessary nutrients, as these diets are nutritionally complete based upon a regular-sized portion, not a diet-sized portion. Higher Fiber and Lower Fat Diets higher in fiber and lower in fat promote satiety (a feeling of fullness) while still having a lower caloric density than regular dog foods. Dietary fiber can\u2019t be digested, so it adds no calories to a dog\u2019s diet. Weight-loss foods tend to contain sources of both soluble and insoluble fiber because this combination promotes weight loss while not leading to unpleasant side effects like dramatically increased poop production or a dog food that tastes yucky. Dietary fat is the most calorie-dense nutrient, containing more than twice the number of calories per gram in comparison to proteins and carbohydrates so it makes sense to limit the amount of fat in dog foods designed to promote weight loss. \u00a0 Therapeutic L-Carnitine Levels\u00a0 L-carnitine is an amino acid that\u00a0helps move more fatty acids into cells to be burned for energy. This helps dogs move and metabolize fat instead of storing it. Look for L-carnitine in the dog food\u2019s ingredient list. It may also be listed under the \u201cGuaranteed Analysis\u201d section of the food label.\u00a0 Antioxidants Diets formulated for weight loss are often enriched with antioxidants that neutralize free radicals that damage cells. Many of these antioxidants also have an anti-inflammatory action. This can benefit dogs who are overweight because they tend to experience more inflammation than slimmer dogs do. Creating a Feeding Routine for Your Dog\u2019s Weight-Loss Plan It\u2019s important for you to work with your veterinarian to create a feeding routine that keeps your pup satiated while also on track with their weight-loss plan. Here are a few tips you can follow to help your dog hit their weight-loss goals: Measure out the exact amount of food as directed by your veterinarian Feed your dog several smaller meals throughout the day instead of feeding free-choice or just one or two large meals Do not allow access to other pets\u2019 food or human food Limit treats and stick to vet-approved treats Some vet-approved, low-calorie treats include: Carrot slices Green beans Small amounts of cooked lean meat\u00a0 Packaged low-calorie treats Broccoli Reaching Your Dog\u2019s Target Weight Through Exercise Controlling food and calories is the most important part of a dog\u2019s weight-loss routine, but the process can be helped along by increasing caloric expenditures (burning calories).\u00a0 Talk with your veterinarian about your dog\u2019s unique capabilities and needs before starting a new exercise routine. At your dog\u2019s weigh-ins, your vet will adjust their diet and exercise routine to ideally result in a rate of 1-2% body weight loss per week. Many dogs lose weight in a stair-step fashion, losing quite a bit over a two-week period, and then not losing much over the next two weeks. Major alterations in diet plans are not usually done unless weight has not changed at two sequential examinations. Maintaining the Ideal Weight After your dog\u2019s target weight is reached, your dog\u2019s body weight should be monitored monthly to ensure that the ideal weight is maintained. Just remember that even after the diet is over, approved treats should still only comprise less than 10% of your dog\u2019s total caloric intake. Featured Image: iStock/FatCamera"}]
