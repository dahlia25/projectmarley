Find out whether it has any benefits for your pup.", "articleBody": "NOTE: Always check with your veterinarian first before giving your dog any new foods, especially \u201cpeople foods.\u201d What might be okay for one dog might not be good for your dog, depending on multiple factors, such as their age, health history, health conditions, and diet. Dogs on prescription diets should not be fed any food or treats outside the diet. Yes, adult dogs can eat broccoli. It\u2019s not toxic to dogs and contains health benefits, so it\u2019s safe in small portions. Puppies have different dietary needs than adult dogs, and their digestive systems aren\u2019t as developed. The high fiber content in broccoli could cause problems for puppies, so it\u2019s best to avoid feeding them broccoli.\u00a0 Whether you want to give broccoli to your adult dog as a snack, or if they ate some when your back was turned, here are some safe feeding portions, health benefits, and concerns about dogs eating too much broccoli.\u00a0 Is Broccoli Good for Dogs? Broccoli is not just safe for dogs to eat; it contains many health benefits and nutrients for your dog, just like it does for you. In fact, some dog foods even contain broccoli. It is full of fiber, antioxidants, and digestible plant protein, and it provides vitamins and minerals like: Vitamin C Vitamin K Folic Acid Magnesium Sodium Potassium Chromium Although broccoli provides a lot of great health benefits, your dog cannot rely on broccoli alone for their vitamins and minerals. Additionally, you should be careful not to feed your dog too much broccoli because it can cause intestinal upset. Can Dogs Eat Raw Broccoli? Yes, dogs can eat raw broccoli florets. If you make sure to wash them first, then cut them into small, edible pieces, they are safe and nutritious. In fact, eating broccoli raw or steamed is the best way to keep the most nutrients in the broccoli.\u00a0 Can Dogs Eat Cooked or Steamed Broccoli? Dogs can also safely eat cooked and steamed broccoli. If you steam broccoli for just a few minutes, it will retain more nutrients than if you cook it. But either way, it\u2019s safe for your dog to eat.\u00a0 Just make sure that it\u2019s not too hot so they don\u2019t burn their tongues. And be sure to only feed your pup plain broccoli. That means no butter, oils, or seasonings. Not only are these added ingredients unhealthy for your dog, but certain seasonings like garlic and onion are toxic to dogs.\u00a0 Can Dogs Eat Broccoli Stems? Broccoli stems are not toxic for dogs, but they aren\u2019t the best part of the broccoli to feed to your dog. The stems could become a choking hazard or cause an intestinal blockage. If you do feed stem pieces to your dog, make sure they are cut up into very small, easily edible pieces.\u00a0 If your dog seems to be choking, contact your veterinarian immediately. Can Dogs Be Allergic to Broccoli? Dogs can develop allergies from repeated exposure to a food. Food allergies in dogs usually cause skin issues, rashes, and ear infections. If this is the first time you\u2019re feeding your dog broccoli, you could see signs of food intolerance, which is different from an allergy. Signs of food intolerance include vomiting or diarrhea. Does Broccoli Make Dogs Fart? If you\u2019ve wondered whether broccoli can make a dog fart, the answer is yes! Not only does broccoli contain a high amount of fiber\u2014which can cause an upset stomach and intestinal gas\u2014but the broccoli florets also contain isothiocyanate. This organic compound is thought to help prevent cancer. But it can also cause gastric irritation in dogs\u2014which can also cause your pup to pass gas.\u00a0 And although broccoli contains plant protein that dogs can digest, too much protein can also cause flatulence.\u00a0 How Much Broccoli Can Dogs Eat?

You can add this on top of your dog\u2019s food, or even freeze it in your dog\u2019s KONG toy as a cold treat for later.\u00a0 Featured image: iStock.com/petesphotography"}]
