Learn the potential dangers and benefits of peaches for dogs.", "articleBody": "NOTE: Always check with your veterinarian first before giving your dog any new foods, especially \u201cpeople foods.\u201d What might be okay for one dog might not be good for your dog, depending on multiple factors, such as their age, health history, health conditions, and diet. Dogs on prescription diets should not be fed any food or treats outside the diet. Would you like to share a peach with your pup as a snack? Peaches are one of the many safe fruits that dogs can eat\u2014both puppies and adult dogs. White peaches are much sweeter and less acidic than yellow peaches, so their sugar content is higher. But because both types of peaches have lots of sugar, they should only be given to your dog in moderation, and without the stem or pit.\u00a0 Here\u2019s what you need to know about feeding dogs peaches. Are Peaches Good for Dogs? Yes, peaches can be a good treat for healthy dogs, in moderation. They are high in fiber and low in calories and fat. They are also filled with great antioxidants that help strengthen the immune system, prevent cell damage, and fight against disease. Plus, they contain all the following vitamins and minerals: Vitamin AVitamin CVitamin EVitamin KCopper\u00a0ZincLuteinZeaxanthinCholineFolatePhosphorusManganeseMagnesiumNiacinCan Peaches Be Bad for Dogs? There are a few potential downsides to giving dogs peaches as a snack. They do have a high sugar content, and ingesting too much sugar over time can lead to health problems like diabetes and obesity, which can lead to hip and joint problems.\u00a0 Puppies also have more sensitive stomachs than adult dogs, so they might not react well to eating a new, sugary food.\u00a0 Another concern is the pit. The pit\u2014or stone\u2014in a peach is quite large. Always remove it, because it could become a choking hazard or cause an intestinal blockage. \u00a0 The pit also contains a sugar-cyanide compound that is toxic to dogs. Signs of cyanide toxicity are: VomitingDiarrheaLethargyAbdominal painLoss of appetite\u00a0Difficulty breathingAbnormal heartbeatRed gumsExcessive pantingGagging or regurgitationDilated pupilsSeizuresCollapseIf your dog accidentally eats the peach pit, or you notice any of these symptoms, contact your veterinarian and take your dog to the vet clinic immediately.\u00a0 Can Dogs Eat Peach Yogurt? Although peaches are healthy and safe for dogs, store-bought peach yogurt isn\u2019t a great idea. Flavored yogurt from the store usually contains a lot of added sugars, preservatives, and sometimes xylitol, which is toxic to dogs.\u00a0 You can make your own peach yogurt by mixing peaches with plain yogurt that has no sugars or artificial sweeteners Can Dogs Eat Canned Peaches? Canned peaches are not a great idea for a doggy treat, either. They contain lots of added sugar that is unhealthy for your dog and may give them an upset stomach. Can Dogs Eat Frozen Peaches? Frozen peaches could be a fun treat, but there are a few concerns to watch out for. If they are store-bought frozen peaches, they may have extra sugar and preservatives added. And store-bought frozen peaches usually come in large chunks that could become another choking hazard for your dog.\u00a0The best option is to cut up small pieces of fresh peaches and freeze them. How Many Peaches Can Dogs Eat? How much is too much? Any treat for a dog\u2014even a healthy treat like peaches\u2014should only make up a maximum of 10% of their daily diet, while the other 90% should come from a well-balanced dog food diet.\u00a0Each piece should be no larger than \u00bd-inch cubes. Check out this list for general guidelines on how much peach to feed your dog. Extra-small dog (2-20 lbs.) = 1-2 pieces (Examples: Yorkies, Chihuahuas, Pomeranians, Pugs, Shih Tzus)Small dog (21-30 lbs.) = 2-3 pieces (Examples: Basenjis, Beagles, Miniature Australian Shepherds)Medium dog (31-50 lbs.) = 4-5 pieces (Examples: Basset Hounds, Border Collies, Australian Cattle Dogs, Siberian Huskies)Large dog (51-90 lbs.) = 5-6 pieces (Examples: Pit Bulls, German Shepherds, Labrador Retrievers, Australian Shepherds)Extra-large dog (91+ lbs.) = handful of pieces (Examples: Newfoundlands, Bernese Mountain Dogs, St. Bernards, Great Pyrenees)If you\u2019re nervous that your dog ate too many peaches, watch out for the following symptoms: DiarrheaVomitingLack of appetiteLethargyPainful or distended stomachIf you notice any of these symptoms, contact your veterinarian.\u00a0 How to Safely Feed Your Dog Peaches Below are a few safe and fun ways to feed peaches to your sweet pup as a treat. And when you\u2019re introducing any new food to your dog, make sure to only feed them a little piece first.\u00a0Remove the stem and pit and cut the peach into small 1/2-inch cubed pieces.\u00a0 Peach food topper If you\u2019d like to add some variety up your dog\u2019s regular mealtime, just mash a little bit of sliced peaches and mix it with your dog\u2019s usual food as a food topper. Peach fruit smoothie Blend some peach slices with other dog-safe fruits like bananas, blueberries, and strawberries. Give your dog a little bit as a treat, use it as a food topper, or freeze it in your dog\u2019s KONG toy for later. Serve your dog no more than 2 tablespoons of smoothie per 10 pounds of dog. Peach yogurt or frozen yogurt Blend or mash up some peach slices and mix it with plain, sugar-free, xylitol-free yogurt. You can add other dog-safe fruits to this mixture if you want, then feed it to your pup cold. Or freeze the fruit pieces the night before, and then blend the frozen fruit with the plain yogurt to make a dog-friendly frozen yogurt.\u00a0Serve your dog no more than 2 tablespoons of yogurt per 10 pounds of dog. Stuffed KONG toy You can stuff any of the mixtures above into your dog\u2019s KONG toy, or freeze it for a refreshing frozen treat later. Frozen treats are also helpful in keeping your pup occupied longer.\u00a0 Dehydrated peaches If you want to give your pup dehydrated peaches, use a dehydrator at home. Keep in mind that it will have a higher concentration of sugar at this point. But homemade dehydrated fruit is still much healthier than store-bought because dried fruit from the store usually has much more sugar added, and sometimes extra preservatives.\u00a0Make sure the pieces are very small to avoid choking.
