Mangoes are safe and healthy for most dogs, as long as they don\u2019t have diabetes. Just like many other dog-safe fruits, they have many nutrients.

And feeding your dog lots of sugar over a long period of time can cause them to have problems with obesity, diabetes, oral health, and stomach upset.\u00a0 If your dog already struggles with obesity or diabetes, then mangoes aren\u2019t the right choice for them.

Just remember to feed them smaller portions than normal, because now the sugar content has become more condensed.\u00a0 Avoid feeding store-bought dried mango to your dog. There are usually other preservatives and ingredients, including more sugar. Can Dogs Eat Mango Seeds? Mangoes contain one long, flat seed in the center that looks like a pit.
