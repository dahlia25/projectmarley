Learn what underlying condition may be triggering nosebleeds in your dog, including diagnostic testing, and treatments to help stop nose bleeds in your dog.", "articleBody": "What Is Epistaxis in Dogs? Epistaxis, commonly known as nosebleeds, can vary in severity for dogs, ranging from a small trickle to a heavy flow of blood. Epistaxis refers to the presence of blood coming out of the nose, which can originate from the nostrils themselves or any location within the nasal cavity or nasopharynx, the part of the throat situated behind the nose, where the nasal passages meet the mouth. This bleeding occurs due to compromised blood vessels in this area. There are various reasons why your dog could get a nosebleed. Bleeding from the nose might indicate a problem localized within the nasal passages or a systemic issue affecting other parts of the body. Based on one study, nosebleeds were more prevalent in male dogs aged six years and older and weighing at least 58 pounds. Although nosebleeds might be uncommon in dogs, they are never considered normal. Whether it\u2019s a minor amount of blood from one nostril or a large flow from both nostrils, any time your dog has a nosebleed they should be taken to their vet to be examined as soon as possible. Why Is My Dog\u2019s Nose Bleeding? Epistaxis in dogs can be caused by a variety of underlying conditions. The most common causes of nosebleeds in dogs are trauma and nasal tumors. Trauma\u2014injuries to the mouth, nose, or snout due to blunt force Tumor\u00ads\u00ad\u2014benign or malignant growths, including: Cancers, often affecting the nasal passages, sinuses, or skull Polyps or benign masses Dental disease High blood pressure Clotting or bleeding disorders, including: Von Willebrand disease\u2014a genetic disorder impairing blood clotting Hemophilia\u2014an inherited disorder leading to impaired blood clotting Thrombocytopenia\u2014reduced blood platelet count \u00a0Certain breeds like Cocker Spaniels, Poodles, and Old English Sheepdogs are suspected to have a genetic predisposition to immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)\u2014a complex condition causing excessive clotting followed by bleeding Anemia\u2014a deficiency in red blood cell count Foreign body\u2014objects lodged in or inhaled through the nose Inflammation, such as: Vasculitis\u2014\u2013inflammatory process of the blood vessels Severe allergies leading to rhinitis and/or sinusitis (inflammation of nasal passages and sinuses) Infection\u2014bacterial or fungal Liver failure Poison ingestion\u2014consumption of toxic substances like rat poison Drug reaction\u2014adverse response to medications like: Chemotherapy drugs Estrogen Sulfa antibiotics Unintentional ingestion of human medications such as NSAIDs (e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen) Tick-borne diseases including: Ehrlichiosis Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever What To Do if Your Dog\u2019s Nose Is Bleeding If your dog experiences a minor nosebleed, you can apply simple first aid techniques at home before seeking veterinary care. However, if your dog is bleeding heavily from the nose, take them to their vet or the nearest emergency room right away. Stay calm: It\u2019s important that both you and your dog remain as calm as possible, as excitement can cause the bleeding to worsen. Dogs tend to respond to our energy and emotions, so by being calm yourself, you help lower their anxiety levels. Excitement can also lead to increased blood pressure, which might intensify the bleeding.Ice pack: If your dog tolerates it, you can apply an ice pack to the top of their snout, on the bridge of the nose. The cold can help constrict the blood vessels, slowing down the bleeding.Observe the source of the bleeding: Pay attention to whether the blood is coming from one or both nostrils, as this information will aid your veterinarian in diagnosing the underlying cause.Avoid interventions: Do not administer any medications, nose sprays, or saline solutions into your dog\u2019s nose unless advised by a veterinarian to do so.Seek professional help: Follow up with your veterinarian right away or take your pup to the nearest veterinary emergency room for evaluation.Diagnosis and Treatment of Nosebleeds in Dogs If your dog has a nosebleed, your veterinarian will perform a complete physical examination and run some diagnostic tests to determine the underlying cause. Your vet will ask you about your dog\u2019s recent activities as well as their past medical history, including what medications your dog has recently been on and what trauma they might have experienced. Common diagnostics used to identify the cause of your dog\u2019s nosebleed may include: Lab workImagingUrine testingComplete blood countSerum biochemistry profileClotting profileTick disease panelThese tests can identify clotting disorders (such as thrombocytopenia), anemia, and liver disease, and can indicate if your pet has been exposed to rat poison. Imaging techniques such as X-rays and ultrasound may also be used to assess your dog\u2019s internal organs and detect signs of internal bleeding. Nasal swabs and fungal cultures can also provide insight. Your vet will take your dog\u2019s blood pressure as well, because elevated blood pressure can cause or contribute to a nosebleed. Once your vet determines the underlying cause of your dog\u2019s nosebleed, they can start immediate treatment to help your pup recover. In some cases, your vet might need to sedate your dog to cauterize the blood vessels in the nose to stop the bleeding, especially if trauma was involved. In cases of infection, antibiotics and antifungal medications are prescribed. Some fungal infections might require administering medications directly into your dog\u2019s nasal passages. If your dog is diagnosed with a tick-borne disease, antibiotics such as doxycycline are typically prescribed. If your dog was exposed to or ingested rat poison, treatment would include vitamin K therapy and hospitalization for IV fluids, plasma and/or blood transfusions, and supportive care such as oxygen therapy. Anemia and clotting disorders are often treated with blood and/or plasma transfusions as well. Sometimes, steroid medications such as prednisone are used to help boost the immune system. If your dog has high blood pressure, medications can be started while your veterinarian investigates potential causes, such as kidney disease. If your dog has a nasal tumor, the treatment plan might include radiation, surgery, and/or chemotherapy protocols."}]
