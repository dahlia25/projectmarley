Learn how to treat acute dog vomiting at PetMd.com.", "articleBody": "Image via RelentlessImages/Shutterstock.com It is not uncommon for dogs and cats to vomit from time to time. They might have eaten something that upset their stomachs, or just have sensitive digestive systems. However, it becomes acute when the vomiting does not stop and when there is nothing left in the stomach to throw up except bile (a yellow fluid). It is important you take your pet to a veterinarian in these types of cases. While vomiting may have a simple, straightforward cause, it may be an indicator of something far more serious. It is also problematic because it can have a wide range of causes, and determining the correct one may be quite complicated. Symptoms Vomiting that will not stopPain and distressWeaknessBright blood in the vomit or stool (hematemesis)Evidence of dark blood in the vomit or stool (melena)Causes\u00a0 Dietary indiscretionChange in dietGobbling food/eating too fastIntolerance to a particular food (i.e., be careful feeding pets food intended for humans)Allergic reaction to a particular foodObstructing objectsAcute inflammation of stomach (gastroenteritis)Parasites (e.g., whipworms, roundworms, giardia)Dislocation of the stomach (prone in deep-chested dogs; very critical)TumorsMetabolic disorders (e.g., kidney disease)Liver diseaseHeat strokeAdrenal gland diseaseDiagnosis\u00a0 Bring a sample of the vomit to the veterinarian. If there is a lot of mucus, an inflamed intestine may be the cause. Undigested food in the vomit can be due to food poisoning, anxiety, or simply overeating. Bile, on the other hand, indicates an inflammatory bowel disease or inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). If bright red blood is found, the stomach could be ulcerated. However, if the blood is brown and looks like coffee grounds, the problem may be in the intestine. Finally, strong digestive odors are usually observed when there is an intestinal obstruction. The veterinarian will generally look in your pet\u2019s mouth for foreign objects that may be wedged inside, such as a bone. Enlarged tonsils are another good indicator for this. The pet\u2019s temperature will be taken and an examination of the abdomen will be done. If it turns out to be no more than a passing incident, the veterinarian may ask you to limit the diet to clear fluids and to collect stool samples over that period as the underlying cause may be passed along in the stool. Occasionally, the animal&#039;s body may use vomiting to clear the intestines of toxins. Treatment\u00a0\u00a0 Treatment will be recommended according to the underlying cause behind the vomiting; some possibilities include: Dietary changesDog medications\u00a0to control the vomiting (e.g., cimetidine, anti-emetic)Dog antibiotics, in the case of bacterial ulcersCorticosteroids to treat inflammatory bowel diseaseSurgery, in the case of tumor-caused vomitingSpecial medications for treating chemotherapy induced vomiting\u00a0 Living and Management Always follow the recommended treatment plan from your veterinarian. Do not experiment with medications or food. Pay close attention to your pet and if it does not improve, return to your veterinarian for a follow-up evaluation."}]
