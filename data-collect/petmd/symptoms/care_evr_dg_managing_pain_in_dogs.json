Here\u2019s how you can tell if your dog is in pain and what you can do to help.", "articleBody": "No pet parent wants their dog to be in pain. But because they instinctively try to hide their pain and they can\u2019t tell us when they are hurting, it\u2019s up to us to recognize the subtle signs and to get them the help they need.\u00a0 Many behaviors and physical changes can indicate that a dog is in pain. Learn how to recognize the signs of pain in dogs, what causes it, what you can do to help, and how to discuss your concerns with your vet.\u00a0 Signs a Dog Is in Pain Dogs feel pain just like humans do, but they don\u2019t always show it in the same ways. A dog\u2019s pain can become evident through physical symptoms, behavioral changes, and/or mobility issues. These might be subtle, so stay vigilant and never be afraid to ask your vet about anything that might signal that your dog is in pain.\u00a0 Physical Symptoms\u00a0 When a dog is experiencing pain, you might notice subtle physical signs or changes in how they carry their body. Here are a few physical signs of pain in dogs:\u00a0 Tight or twitching muscles\u00a0 Shaking or trembling\u00a0 Arched back\u00a0 Holding their head below their shoulders\u00a0 Panting\u00a0 Behavioral Changes\u00a0 A dog in pain tends to behave differently than what\u2019s usual for them. Just like us, dogs tend to be crankier when they are experiencing pain. Here are a few behavioral signs that might indicate that your pet is experiencing pain:\u00a0 Not wanting to be touched\u00a0 Excessive licking\u00a0 Excessive vocalization\u00a0 Restlessness\u00a0 Aggression\u00a0 Changes in sleeping habits\u00a0 Mobility Issues\u00a0 If a dog has sustained an injury or is dealing with arthritis, you may notice changes in their mobility. Here are common signs of pain in dogs that affect how they get around:\u00a0 Limping\u00a0 Walking slower or refusing to walk\u00a0 Reluctance to jump or use stairs\u00a0 Difficulties lying down or rising\u00a0 Some of these signs of pain can be seen with serious medical or behavioral problems, so always discuss changes in behavior or normal activity with your veterinarian.\u00a0 What Causes Pain in Dogs?\u00a0 There are two types of pain: acute and\u202fchronic. Something that just happened, like an injury or illness, causes acute pain. Things that have been going on longer, like\u202farthritis\u202for\u202fdental disease, cause chronic pain.\u00a0 Anything that damages cells or creates inflammation can cause pain in dogs including:\u00a0 Damage to bones or joints\u202f\u00a0 Soft tissue injuries like sprains, strains, or bruising\u00a0 Back problems\u00a0 Dental disease\u00a0 Ear, skin, and urinary tract infections\u00a0 Severe stomach upset\u00a0 Some kinds of cancer\u00a0 Surgeries\u00a0 And much, much more!\u00a0 How to Help a Dog That\u2019s in Pain\u00a0 If you think your dog is suffering, \u00a0know that there are a lot of different things you can do to help them start to feel better. Here are some steps you can take to help your dog cope with pain and work towards relief.\u00a0 Make an Appointment With Your Veterinarian\u00a0 First, schedule an appointment with your veterinarian to figure out what the problem is. If your dog is in severe pain or has other scary symptoms, get them to a veterinarian immediately.\u00a0 Your veterinarian will need to perform a physical exam and run some diagnostic tests. To pinpoint the problem, your vet may need to do X-rays, blood tests, or an ultrasound.\u00a0 Stop or Modify Physical Activities With Your Pet\u00a0 If your pet is only showing signs of pain during an activity, avoid it until you can talk to your veterinarian.\u00a0 Your veterinarian will be able to help you figure out how to best help your pet, whether it is stopping that activity altogether or establishing modifications that will minimize pain.\u00a0 Simple pain-reducing modifications to common activities can include: \u00a0 Taking shorter walks\u00a0 Using a ramp or steps\u00a0 Raising food/water dishes to a more comfortable height\u00a0 For some instances of acute pain, these changes might be temporary, but for some chronic pain conditions, they may be long-term, or at least until other treatments have a chance to take full effect.\u00a0 Keep a Record of the Signs You\u2019re Seeing\u00a0 We\u2019ve all been through the scenario where we see certain signs at home, but by the time we get to the vet, everything looks fine.\u00a0 That\u2019s why it can be helpful to take pictures or a video of your pet when they are showing signs of pain or discomfort, which they\u2019re more likely to do at home than when they are stressed out at the veterinary clinic. Write down when they occur and what your pet was doing at the time.\u00a0 This helps your vet understand the scenarios in which your dog is experiencing pain as well as the types of symptoms and signs of pain they are displaying.\u00a0 Having video and pictures of your dog can also help your veterinarian to make the proper modifications to your routine and recommend other treatment options to help minimize the pain.\u00a0 Explore All of the Treatment Options\u00a0 There are many veterinary treatments that can eliminate or reduce both acute and chronic pain. Talk with your veterinarian to understand what your dog\u2019s treatment options are.\u00a0 The most common treatments for pain include:\u00a0 Medications including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, opioids, and others\u00a0 Surgery\u00a0 Physical rehabilitation\u00a0 Laser therapy\u00a0 Acupuncture\u00a0 Chiropractic treatment\u00a0 Regenerative medicine such as stem cell therapy\u00a0 Massage\u00a0 Supplements and herbal therapies\u00a0 Ice or heat packs\u00a0 Ask Questions and Don\u2019t Be Afraid to Get a Second Opinion\u00a0 Here are some questions you might ask your vet:\u00a0 How will you manage my pet\u2019s pain before, during, and after surgery?\u00a0 How will a specific treatment help their pain?\u00a0 Can a supplement help reduce pain?\u00a0 What modifications can I make at home to help them?\u00a0 What else we can do for their pain?\u00a0 You can also always contact another general practitioner vet; integrative vet; veterinary pain practitioner; or veterinary specialists like a behaviorist, surgeon, oncologist, or neurologist for a second opinion and additional treatment options.\u00a0 Be Your Dog\u2019s Advocate\u00a0 Your dog depends on you to be her voice to get her the help she needs.\u00a0 So if you think your dog is showing any signs of pain, including any changes in routine, preferences, and behaviors, set up an appointment with your vet as soon as you can.\u00a0 Even if the signs resolve, you\u2019ll want to keep the appointment to be sure whatever was causing the pain does not become a long-term problem.\u00a0 If your pet is injured, ill, or showing multiple or severe signs of pain, don\u2019t hesitate to take them to an emergency vet clinic to get their pain treated as soon as possible.\u00a0 You are your dog\u2019s best health advocate.\u00a0 Featured Image: iStock.com/xijian"}]
