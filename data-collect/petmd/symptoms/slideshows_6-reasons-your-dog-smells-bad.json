Here are six reasons why your dog might smell bad.", "articleBody": "By Lynne Miller \u00a0 No matter how much you love your dog, it is hard to love a dog\u2019s stinky scent, especially if she enjoys rolling in dead animal remains or munching on excrement. \u00a0 Of course, many odors are not so easily explained or managed. \u00a0 Whether putrid or pungent, dog smells should be taken seriously since a bad odor may be a sign of a serious disease. \u00a0 Don\u2019t just wrinkle your nose the next time you get a whiff of your dog. \u00a0 Here are six reasons why your furry friend smells bad. Have you ever wondered why your dog stinks right after a bath? Microorganisms like yeast and bacteria quietly live in your dog\u2019s fur, and as long as the fur stays dry, there\u2019s little odor, the American Chemical Society explains in this video. When your dog takes a bath or goes for a swim, the water causes the release of stinky compounds.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThe water molecules have displaced the smaller volatile compounds which are odoriferous,\u201d explains George Preti, a scientist and expert on body odor, based at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Pay attention to changes in your dog\u2019s breath. For example, a foul odor that crops up out of the blue could mean she has an infection. \u00a0 \u201cThe odor of a bad tooth infection is very unpleasant,\u201d says Dr. Laurie Coger, a holistic veterinarian and dog trainer. \u00a0 Bad breath may also indicate kidney disease or diabetes. \u00a0 The breath of a dog with kidney failure can smell like urine, or have a metallic odor, says Dr. Ann Hohenhaus, a staff doctor at the Animal Medical Center in New York City. If this describes your dog\u2019s breath, she should see a vet right away. \u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely different than run-of-the-mill bad breath due to bad teeth,\u201d Hohenhaus says. \u00a0 Late-stage diabetes may also produce a unique scent. \u00a0 \u201cWithout insulin, the body can\u2019t use the food it eats,\u201d Hohenhaus explains.\u00a0 \u201cA diabetic pet will eat tons of food, but they lose weight like crazy, and can\u2019t use the food that\u2019s digested by the body. They break down their own body for nutrients.\u201d \u00a0 That generates ketones, which produce a distinctive odor on the breath. Some say it smells like nail polish remover, others think the odor is sweet. \u00a0 \u201cOnce you smell a pet with ketones on the breath, you\u2019ll never forget it,\u201d Hohenhaus says. \u00a0 If your pet has this symptom, take her to the vet immediately. If you have a Spaniel, Pekingese, Pug, Bulldog, or Shar-Pei, you need to keep an eye on your pet\u2019s skin folds. These dogs are prone to skin fold dermatitis, a stinky skin disorder. \u00a0 To avoid infection and a foul odor, cleanse your pet\u2019s skin folds on a regular basis. \u00a0 \u201cSkin fold cleaning is really important in those dogs,\u201d says Coger, who recommends using skin fold cleansers or baby wipes to gently clean the folds. \u00a0 Any dog can get a skin infection that smells bad if the skin\u2019s normal barriers are broken down by prolonged dampness, allergies, hormonal disorders, etc. Red, inflamed skin could indicate an infection, Coger says.\u00a0 If your dog\u2019s ears smell like yeast, she probably has\u2014you guessed it\u2014a yeast infection, which is very common in canines. Bacterial ear infections are also a frequent problem for dogs, and they tend to smell worse than yeast infections \u00a0 Dogs with long, droopy ears are prone to ear problems, which often go hand in hand with allergies. Dogs with allergies tend to have more ear infections, Hohenhaus says. \u00a0 \u201cYou have to treat the ears and you may have to treat the whole dog for an allergy issue,\u201d she says. \u00a0 You and your dog\u2019s doctor should explore what\u2019s causing the allergy\u2014whether it\u2019s something in your pet\u2019s food, pollen outside or dust mites in the home.\u00a0 If your dog\u2019s gas is powerful enough to clear a room, she probably ate something she shouldn\u2019t have. If she\u2019s also having diarrhea and vomiting, she may have eaten something really nasty, like a rotten carcass or something in the trash. \u00a0 Controlling gas is not always as simple as keeping your dog from scavenging. Sometimes increased flatulence is a sign of a serious health problem, Hohenhaus says. \u00a0 But assuming your dog\u2019s gas is not related to an underlying health issue, Hohenhaus says a change in diet could cut down on flatulence. The best diet will meet your dog\u2019s individual needs. \u00a0 Coger believes grain-free diets can make a difference. \u00a0 \u201cSwitching to grain-free diets often improves digestion, leading to less flatulence, smaller and less smelly stools, and fewer ear and skin infections,\u201d she says.\u00a0 Also known as anal glands, anal sacs are located on either side of the animal\u2019s anus. The walls of the sacs are lined with glands, and the sacs fill up with a foul-smelling substance. Normally, the dog secretes some of it when she poops. \u00a0 Dogs with impacted or infected anal sacs will lick their backsides excessively or slide their bottoms on the ground to relieve itchiness, Hohenhaus says. The animals may expel a brown substance that smells far worse than feces. \u00a0 Your pet\u2019s anal sacs can be manually expressed at the vet\u2019s office, Hohenhaus says. Failing to address impacted anal sacs can lead to abscesses and ruptures. \u00a0 If your dog suffers from chronic anal sac problems, it could be related to allergies. \u00a0 \u201cIn spring time, when the pollen comes out, you\u2019ll see more animals sliding their butts along the ground,\u201d Hohenhaus says. \u201cIt\u2019s a manifestation of allergies. Talk to your veterinarian about allergy management.\u201d\u00a0 Regular bathing and grooming can minimize normal funky odors not related to health problems. \u00a0 Most dogs should be bathed about once a month, Coger says. Dogs with longer coats may require more frequent baths, while pups with short coats may go longer between baths. \u00a0 Make sure to brush or comb your dog when she\u2019s shedding, since dead hair and skin cells can lead to odor, Coger says. \u00a0 Waterless shampoos can be helpful between baths, particularly for \u201cspot cleaning,\u201d Coger says. \u201cBreeds with facial folds or long hair that may get food on it can benefit from these products.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 Used lightly, baby powder, or simple cornstarch, can help absorb odors.\u00a0\u201cYou need to avoid using large amounts that will cake up,\u201d Coger says.\u00a0"}]
