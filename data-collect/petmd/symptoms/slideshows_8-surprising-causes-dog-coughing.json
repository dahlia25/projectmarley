That cough may be nothing more than a reaction to inhaling an environmental irritant. \u201cCoughing is an important body defense to keep the respiratory tract free of harmful substances, foreign materials and debris, and excessive secretions,\u201d says Dr. Camille DeClementi, vice president of the ASPCA Animal Hospital in New York City. Similar to how we reflexively cough when inhaling dust, for example. \u00a0 In other cases, it may signal a more serious underlying condition. Some of the most common causes of coughing in dogs are heart disease, chronic bronchitis, heartworm disease, and respiratory infections caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. \u00a0 Beyond the usual suspects lurks other, less common culprits that may be behind your canine companion&#039;s hacking. If your vet can\u2019t find the root of your dog&#039;s coughing, here are eight surprising causes to consider.\u00a0 \u00a0 A class of rat poisons called anticoagulants work by preventing blood from clotting, which results in bleeding. Our dogs are not immune to the danger. \u201cIngesting anticoagulants can cause a dog to bleed into her chest cavity, which can lead to coughing,\u201d DeClementi says. A dog who has ingested rat poison needs to be taken to an emergency clinic (pronto) to prevent life-threatening bleeding, she says.\u00a0 \u00a0 Depending on the amount of blood lost, the patient may need a blood transfusion, says Dr. Susan Jeffrey, a veterinarian with Truesdell Animal Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin. And because anticoagulants block the synthesis of vitamin K (which is necessary for normal clotting), the dog will need vitamin K therapy until the effects of the anticoagulant wane. \u00a0 Avoid putting your dog and yourself through this agony by focusing on prevention. \u201cDon\u2019t use these products where dogs can eat them,\u201d DeClementi recommends. Better yet, invest in a humane method of rodent control, like a no-kill trap, and practice trap and release.\u00a0 \u00a0 Any number of airborne irritants lurking in your home can cause your dog to cough, DeClementi says. Some of these include dust mites, fireplace ash, dandruff, litter tray dust, second-hand smoke, mold, aerosolized products like household sprays, air fresheners, and even deodorants. \u00a0 You may not react to these irritants, but they can still be a problem for your companion. \u201cDogs have a much stronger sense of smell than we do, so what might not bother us, may bother dogs,\u201d Jeffrey says. \u00a0 Not every dog exposed to these irritants will cough, however. \u201cIt\u2019s similar to people\u2014not everyone who goes outside and breathes in the air is going to start coughing from pollen,\u201d says Dr. Cathy Meeks, a veterinarian with BluePearl Veterinary Partners in Tampa, Florida. But a dog with an underlying respiratory condition like bronchitis or simply one who is more sensitive to a particular trigger may be more susceptible. \u00a0 You probably know that a pudgy dog is at added risk of developing a number of health issues like arthritis, and congestive heart failure. Another good reason to put your best friend on a diet is that the extra weight is tied to coughing, Jeffrey says. \u00a0 \u201cSome dogs can be so obese that the fat puts pressure on the respiratory tract, and that can cause a cough.\u201d The only solution for this, she says, is weight loss. Talk to your vet about putting your dog on a safe and sensible diet. \u00a0 Even a pound of extra weight can be harmful to your faithful companion. (Take petMD&#039;s interactive online \u201cIs My Pet Fat?\u201d quiz to see how your dog fares.) \u00a0 It\u2019s hard to imagine a single blade of grass causing respiratory problems, but this is precisely what Meeks, who is board certified in veterinary internal medicine, encounters on occasion. When using an endoscope to check a dog\u2019s airway expecting to see infection, she sometimes finds a blade of grass instead.\u00a0 \u00a0 Specific types of grass (found mostly in the western part of the country) produce grass awns or foxtails with sharp \u201cblades\u201d that can penetrate a dog\u2019s skin. The blade can poke its way through the dog\u2019s skin and migrate into the lung. This can lead to coughing too, Meeks says. \u00a0 Grass awns that migrate into the lungs or chest cavity can result in more than just bouts of coughing. \u201cThey can cause pneumonia, lung abscesses, pneumothorax, pyothorax, or a combination of these conditions,\u201d adds Dr. Anusha Balakrishnan, a veterinarian at Cornell University Veterinary Specialists in Stamford, Connecticut. \u00a0 Lungworms are parasites that cause infection in the pulmonary artery and right heart ventricle in dogs, Balakrishnan says. They then move out into the airways of a dog\u2019s lungs. \u201cClinical signs may vary from coughing or exercise intolerance, to life-threatening pulmonary edema (excess fluid in the lungs).\u201d \u00a0 Lungworms are not nearly as common as heartworms, Meeks says, but they can indeed explain your dog\u2019s cough. \u201cDogs can get infected by eating prey infected with the worm. They migrate out of the intestines into the bloodstream and into the lungs.&quot; \u00a0 Dogs can also get infected by ingesting slugs and terrestrial snails that serve as hosts for the parasite, says Balakrishnan, who is board certified in emergency and critical care. Treatment typically requires prescribing de-worming medication such as fenbendazole, \u201cwith advanced respiratory support required for severely affected dogs.\u201d \u00a0 A dog\u2019s lung can rotate and twist, a condition called lung lobe torsion. \u201cThe lung turns over on itself, blocking the airway,\u201d Meeks explains. In addition to coughing, lung lobe torsion can result in symptoms like coughing up blood, pain, fever, and lethargy. \u00a0 Vets often have trouble pinpointing precisely why this happens, but lung lobe torsion is more common in dogs with fluid in the chest, Meeks says, or \u201cit can possibly occur as a result of heart disease or another condition.\u201d \u00a0 Some breeds tend to be more at risk. \u201cSmaller dogs like Pugs, as well as large, deep-chested breed dogs may be predisposed,\u201d says Dr. Zenithson Ng, a board-certified vet and clinical assistant professor at the University of Tennessee, College of Veterinary Medicine. \u00a0 The Afghan Hound is 133 times more likely to develop lung lobe torsion than other breeds, according to a report by MediMedia Animal Health. Smaller breeds at higher risk (aside from Pugs) include Yorkshire Terriers, Beagles, and Miniature Poodles. \u00a0 One of the most common and deadliest gases resulting from house fires is carbon monoxide, which binds to hemoglobin molecules (the stuff that makes blood turn red) and leads to a decrease in blood oxygen levels, Balakrishnan explains. \u00a0 Another dangerous gas is hydrogen cyanide, formed by the burning of certain materials, including plastics, wool, and silk, she says. \u00a0 \u201cOther common clinical consequences that have been reported in patients with smoke inhalation injury include acute upper airway obstruction, bronchospasm, small airway occlusion, pulmonary infection, and respiratory failure.\u201d \u00a0 House fires also produce soot that she says can adhere to the lining of the respiratory tree and weaken respiratory trace defenses. \u00a0 Coughing is a common symptom for all of these conditions associated with smoke inhalation. \u00a0 Certain types of medicines vets prescribe to their canine patients are accompanied by the side effect of coughing. One commonly prescribed class of medications that can make dogs cough are angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. ACE inhibitors typically cause coughing that is dry, hacking, and irritating, and usually occurs at night, he says. \u00a0 It may be tempting to blame your dog\u2019s cough on an ACE inhibitor, especially if the coughing started at the same time you began giving her the medication. But don\u2019t make assumptions. \u201cIt can be confusing because ACE inhibitors are used to treat heart disease.\u201d And coughing is also a symptom of heart disease. \u00a0 Always run any persistent cough past your vet. \u201cWe give a complete physical exam, get complete history of when and how the cough developed, and use diagnostic tools like X-rays, blood tests, and ultrasound to help us get to the bottom of the causes of coughing,\u201d says Rosenthal, who is board certified in internal medicine \u00a0 Mostly likely, your vet will attribute your dog\u2019s cough to one of the more common causes, like cardiac issues or a respiratory infection. But there may be times when one of these less likely culprits is to blame."}]
