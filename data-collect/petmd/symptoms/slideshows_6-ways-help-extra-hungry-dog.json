Here are six ways to help a hungry dog.", "articleBody": "By Helen Anne Travis \u00a0 No matter how much you feed them, some dogs act like they\u2019re always hungry. They go crazy at dinnertime, beg for dog treats throughout the day, and follow you around the kitchen, hoping you\u2019ll accidentally drop something delicious on the floor. No matter how many treats you accidentally drop, it seems like they can never get enough. \u00a0 No pet parent wants to feel like they\u2019re starving their pup, but keeping portion sizes and feeding schedules under control is important for keeping your dog healthy. Here are 6 ways you can help a hungry dog. Some medical conditions cause a dog to feel extra hungry, says Dr. Judy Morgan, a holistic veterinarian and author of several books about natural pet-care. \u00a0 Bring your dog to the vet to rule out conditions like hypothyroidism, diabetes, and Cushing&#039;s disease, all of which can cause excess hunger in dogs. Hyperthyroidism, due to a tumor in the thyroid gland, could also affect their appetites, says Morgan, but this condition is quite rare in dogs. \u00a0 Cancer and intestinal parasites can also make dogs extra hungry, says Dr. Anthony Ishak, a veterinarian at BluePearl Veterinary Partners in Tampa, Florida. \u00a0 \u201cA dog that\u2019s eating a lot and not gaining weight could have a serious medical problem,\u201d he says. Once you rule out any medical issues, don\u2019t give in to the temptation to overfeed, says Morgan. Overfeeding can actually make dogs hungrier. \u00a0 \u201cDon&#039;t allow these \u2018starving\u2019 dogs to con you into giving them more than they need,\u201d she says. \u201cOverfeeding can lead to obesity, which causes a decrease in the production of leptin, a hormone that controls appetite.\u201d \u00a0 Obesity can also lead to other medical complications. Obese dogs are more likely to develop arthritis. The excess weight puts extra demand on the dog\u2019s joints, which can lead to decreased mobility and muscle strength. Obesity also makes the heart work harder and can impact a dog\u2019s ability to fully inflate his lungs, Morgan says. \u00a0 Understand that giving hungry dogs too many treats or human food snacks will make the problem worse, says Ishak. To satisfy dogs\u2019 cravings without packing on the pounds, the doctors recommended introducing more vegetables into their diets. \u00a0 Vegetables like carrots and green beans can be added to dogs\u2019 meals to bulk up the food\u2019s fiber content and make the pups feel more full without adding a lot of calories, says Morgan. Grind the vegetables and cook them lightly before serving to your dog. \u00a0 \u201cVeggies can make great snacks between meals, as well,\u201d she says. \u00a0 Just be careful about introducing too much fiber too fast. This can lead to flatulence, constipation, or diarrhea, she says. \u00a0 Boosting your pup\u2019s vegetable content may also help curb her hunger in other ways. Chromium, a mineral found in ingredients like broccoli and sweet potatoes, has been shown to help reduce hunger in humans and may also help dogs, Morgan says. Feeding multiple small meals throughout the day, rather than one or two big meals, may help your dog feel more satisfied, says Morgan. \u00a0 Make sure you speak with your veterinarian and figure out exactly how much dog food your dog should be eating each day. Don\u2019t exceed that total. Divide the recommended daily serving into small portions and try feeding in the morning, late afternoon, and right before bedtime to help curb your dog\u2019s appetite throughout the day. No matter how many veggies and small meals you offer them, some dogs will still do anything for a treat. Use it to your advantage, says Morgan. These food-motivated pups can be easier to train because you know exactly what they want as a reward. \u00a0 Also realize that sometimes the hunger may be more of an emotional than physical experience. A dog may associate treats with positive experiences with his owner. See if a non-food reward will satisfy his craving for attention. See if you can take your dog\u2019s mind off the hunger. Rather than giving a treat, go for a ride in the car or take him on a walk. This is also a great time to work on training exercises. \u00a0 If you can distract your pup with exercise and interaction, you may be able to reduce his cravings and spend more quality time together. Plus, getting some extra exercise is an added bonus for a pup that likes to eat, says Morgan.\u00a0"}]
