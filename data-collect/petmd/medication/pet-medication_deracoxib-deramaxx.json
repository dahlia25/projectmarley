This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Deramaxx\u00ae? Deramaxx\u00ae (deracoxib) is an FDA-approved non-narcotic, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) prescription medication for canines. It is used primarily for the treatment of post-operative pain and inflammation caused by orthopedic and general surgery, including dental surgery. It is also used to treat inflammation associated with arthritis, and may also be used to control fevers and inflammation caused by other conditions. \u00a0 In dogs, Deramaxx\u00ae may offer some anti-cancer effects through off-label use. It can be used in combination with some chemotherapy medications to treat a particular bladder cancer called a transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) and a blood-based cancer called hemangiosarcoma. The term off- or extra-label means that a medication is used in a way or in a particular species that is not specified on the medication label. While veterinarians often prescribe medications for off-label uses, your veterinarian will determine whether Deramaxx\u00ae is right for your pet. How Deramaxx\u00ae Works NSAIDs block the production of natural chemicals that trigger inflammation\u2014called a COX pathway. Some COX pathways are helpful with digestion, kidney health and clotting, but Deramaxx\u00ae blocks significantly more of the inflammatory chemicals than the beneficial ones. Because Deramaxx\u00ae can still partially inhibit the beneficial chemicals, especially at higher doses, make sure to speak with your veterinarian about prescription instructions and follow those directions closely. Deramaxx\u00ae Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. This medication is given at different dosages based on the condition for which it is prescribed. Generally, your veterinarian may recommend giving the medication once daily by mouth. Deramaxx\u00ae can be given with or without food, but giving it with food can help to prevent digestive system upset. As determined by your veterinarian, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with your pet\u2019s individual response. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if \u00a0you forget to give a dose of Deramaxx\u00ae. Generally, they may advise you to give it when you remember, or, \u00a0if it is almost time for your next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. In most cases, do not give extra or double doses. Deramaxx\u00ae Possible Side Effects Deramaxx\u00ae is generally well-tolerated. Vomiting and loss of appetite are the most common side effects noted.\u00a0 Additional side effects may include: Diarrhea or soft stools Dark tarry stool Bloody vomiting or diarrhea Abdominal pain Increased salivation Urinary tract infection Unilateral conjunctivitis Seizures Panting Tachycardia Blindness Lethargy Weight loss Stomach ulcers Change in thirst or urination Jaundice (yellowing of the gums, skin, or eyes) General itchiness In some cases, death has been reported as an outcome of the adverse events listed above. If you believe your pet may be experiencing any side effects, consult your veterinarian. Human Side Effects This medication is not intended for use in humans. If you accidentally ingest a pet medication, call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222.\u00a0 Monitoring Specific monitoring or routine testing while your pet is on this medication may be recommended by your veterinarian depending on your pets&#039; individual needs, other medications they may be on, and/or the issue that initially caused your pet to be placed on this medication.
