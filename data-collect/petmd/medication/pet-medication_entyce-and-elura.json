This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What are Entyce\u00ae and Elura\u00ae? Entyce\u00ae and Elura\u00ae are both medications that may help pets improve their appetite. Entyce\u00ae is FDA approved for dogs as an appetite stimulant, while Elura\u00ae is FDA approved for cats to help manage weight loss associated with chronic kidney disease. Entyce\u00ae and Elura\u00ae come in liquid form and are administered orally. Both contain capromorelin as their active ingredient, but at different concentrations. How Entyce\u00ae and Elura\u00ae Work Capromorelin is the active ingredient in Entyce\u00ae and Elura\u00ae. Capromorelin is a ghrelin-receptor agonist that increases the production of growth hormone within the body and signals the brain\u2019s hypothalamus to stimulate appetite. Speak with your veterinarian about whether Entyce\u00ae and Elura\u00ae are right for your pet. Both products should not be used in dogs and cats that have a hypersensitivity to capromorelin, and Elura\u00ae should not be used in cats with hypersomatotropism (acromegaly). Entyce\u00ae and Elura\u00ae Directions Entyce\u00ae and Elura\u00ae are both liquid oral medications. Follow the administration directions on the drug label closely or as directed by your veterinarian.Your veterinarian will determine the appropriate dosage based on your pet\u2019s weight. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of Entyce\u00ae or Elura\u00ae. Generally, they may advise you to give the dose when you remember. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, your veterinarian may instruct you to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. In most cases, do not give extra or double doses. \u00a0 Entyce\u00ae and Elura\u00ae Possible Side Effects Side effects in dogs and cats may include: Diarrhea Vomiting Drooling Belly pain Nausea Flatulence Increased thirst Lack of energy Additional side effects of Elura\u00ae in cats may include: Loss of appetite Changes in behavior Anemia (low red blood cell count) Dehydration If you believe your pet may be experiencing any side effects, consult your veterinarian. Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) Your pet\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of Entyce\u00ae or Elura\u00ae Human Side Effects This medication is not approved for use in humans. If you accidentally ingest a pet medication, immediately seek medical attention or call the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222. Monitoring For cat parents: Elura\u00ae mimics the action of a naturally-occurring hormone called ghrelin. Ghrelin influences many systems in the body and Elura\u00ae may also affect these systems. As such, your veterinarian may instruct you to monitor for changes in thirst or water intake; lethargy or weakness; digestive issues (vomiting, diarrhea, drooling, decreased appetite); or behaviors. Typically, no other specific monitoring is required for Elura\u00ae or Entyce\u00ae, but your veterinarian may recommend routine testing depending on your pet\u2019s individual needs, other medications they may be on, and/or the issue that initially caused your pet to be placed on this medication. Keeping a log of your pet\u2019s food intake and body weight can help to monitor their response to this medication. Entyce\u00ae and Elura\u00ae Overdose Information Signs of Entyce\u00ae overdoses in dogs include drooling, red or swollen paws, liver damage, and pale skin or gums.
