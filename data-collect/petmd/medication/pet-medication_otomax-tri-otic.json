This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Otomax\u00ae and Tri-Otic\u00ae? Otomax\u00ae and Tri-Otic\u00ae are the brand names for a prescription combination otic (ear) ointment. The three active ingredients in Otomax\u00ae and Tri-Otic\u00ae are gentamicin, betamethasone and clotrimazole. These medications are used to treat external ear infections in dogs caused by susceptible strains of yeast (Malassezia pachydermatis) and bacteria susceptible to the antibiotic gentamicin. Currently, Otomax\u00ae and Tri-Otic\u00ae are only FDA approved for use in dogs, but they are often used off-label in cats and other mammals. The term off-label or extra-label use means that a medication is used in a way, or in a particular species, that is not described on the drug product label. While veterinarians often prescribe medications for off-label uses, your veterinarian will determine whether this medication is right for your pet. How Otomax\u00ae and Tri-Otic\u00ae Works Otomax\u00ae and Tri-Otic\u00ae contain three ingredients that work together to treat susceptible ear infections: Gentamycin: an antibiotic active against several common pathogenic bacteria that infect the ear Betamethasone: a steroid utilized to decrease inflammation in the ear canal Clotrimazole: a broad-spectrum antifungal agent used to treat common yeast organisms If your pet\u2019s ear infection does not improve after treatment with Otomax\u00ae or Tri-Otic\u00ae, the cause of the infection may be another microorganism that is not susceptible to this medication. Before using these products, it is critical that your veterinarian examines your dog\u2019s eardrum to ensure it is intact to avoid damage to the inner ear. These products should not be used in dogs with known perforation of eardrums. Otomax\u00ae and Tri-Otic\u00ae Directions Typically, Otomax\u00ae and Tri-Otic\u00ae are administered directly into the infected ear canal once daily for seven consecutive days. The number of drops to administer into each ear will vary based on the pet\u2019s size and the severity of the infection. Ensure that the external ear canal is thoroughly cleaned and dried before treatment. Pets with long ear hair may need to have the hair trimmed for the application to be effective. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to administer a dose of Otomax\u00ae or Tri-Otic\u00ae. Generally, they may advise you to apply it when you remember. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, they may instruct you to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. In most cases, do not give extra or double doses. Otomax\u00ae or Tri-Otic\u00ae Possible Side Effects Topical irritation at the application site is the most common side effect, including: Redness Blistering Peeling Swelling Itching Hives Administration of these medications beyond the recommended seven days may result in delayed wound healing. Hearing loss or deafness has been noted in a small number of sensitive or geriatric dogs. The hearing deficit is usually temporary. However, if hearing or vestibular dysfunction is noted during the course of treatment, immediately discontinue use of the ointment and flush the ear canal thoroughly with a non-toxic solution.
