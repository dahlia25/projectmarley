This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Potassium Bromide? Potassium bromide is a prescription medication that can be used alone or with another medication to control epilepsy seizures in dogs. Potassium bromide is also available under the following brands: K-BroVet-CA1\u00ae chewable tablets and K-BroVet\u00ae oral solution. K-BroVet-CA1\u00ae contains potassium bromide that is specifically formulated as chewable tablets. This particular formulation has been conditionally approved by the FDA to be reasonably safe and effective in treating epilepsy in dogs. Its full approval by the FDA is pending more robust post-marketing data to further prove its safety and effectiveness. K-BroVet\u00ae is an oral solution that contains three ingredients: potassium bromide, vitamin B12, and pyridoxine (vitamin B6). Although K-BroVet\u00ae is not currently approved by the FDA, it is also used to treat epilepsy in dogs. Potassium bromide is readily utilized in the veterinary field, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain unapproved drugs for use in animals in certain circumstances. This medication has not been tested in dogs that are intended for breeding or that are pregnant or nursing. Additionally, this medication has not been tested in young dogs or neonates. Speak with your veterinarian about whether this medication is right for your pet. How Potassium Bromide Works Chloride is a naturally occurring ion in the body that has many essential functions, including\u00a0conducting necessary electric charges throughout the brain and nervous system. However, in pets with epilepsy, there is a buildup of chloride in the brain that causes seizures. When potassium bromide is administered, it separates into two ions in the body: potassium and bromide. The bromide component is key in re-balancing\u00a0chloride levels in the brain, thereby reducing the likelihood of a seizure from reoccurring.\u00a0 In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of potassium bromide. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here.

Additionally, this medication should not be used in pets with a history of hypersensitivity to Bromide. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of potassium bromide. Generally, they may instruct you to give it when you remember, or if it is almost time for your next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. Potassium Bromide Possible Side Effects Grogginess and decreased balance for the first few days to weeks after starting this medication may be seen.
