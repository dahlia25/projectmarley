Learn how phenobarbital works in pets, including directions and possible side effects.", "articleBody": "PetMD\u2019s medications content was written and reviewed by veterinary professionals to answer your most common questions about how medications function, their side effects, and what species they are prescribed for. This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Phenobarbital? Phenobarbital is used to treat seizures in many species including dogs, cats, horses, rabbits, cattle, and ferrets that are diagnosed with epilepsy, brain tumors, infectious disease processes and even some toxins. It can be used on its own or in combination with other anticonvulsant (anti-seizure) medications. Phenobarbital is FDA-approved for human use. It is currently not FDA-approved as a veterinary medication. However, it is readily utilized in the veterinary field, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs in animals in certain circumstances. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. Your veterinarian will determine whether this medication is right for your pet. Phenobarbital is classified as a DEA Schedule IV controlled substance. As such, this may affect the prescribing, dispensing, and refilling of this medication due to requirements under federal and state law. Likewise, it is illegal for you to consume, transfer, sell, or otherwise give away your pet\u2019s phenobarbital. How Phenobarbital Works The brain has naturally occurring chemical messengers that communicate signals throughout the nervous system. Phenobarbital is a barbiturate medication that works by promoting certain chemical messengers to slow down and stabilize activity in the brain, thereby lowering the likelihood of seizures from occurring. Phenobarbital Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Generally, your veterinarian may recommend giving phenobarbital at the same time every day. Phenobarbital can be given with or without food, but giving it with food can decrease the risk of digestive upset. If your veterinarian recommends that you discontinue this medication for any reason, it is important to follow your veterinarian\u2019s guidance closely on how to wean your pet off this medication. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarians about what to do if you forget to give a dose of phenobarbital. Generally, they may instruct you to give it when you remember, or, if it is almost time for your next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. Phenobarbital Possible Side Effects Lethargy, or fatigue, is commonly observed in pets when they first start taking phenobarbital. It generally occurs temporarily while their body gets used to the medication. If your pet is severely lethargic, please inform your veterinarian immediately. Additional symptoms may include: Lethargy Vomiting Diarrhea Loss of appetite Agitation Increased thirst and urination Increased appetite Liver irritation Lack of coordination Facial itching, especially in cats Human Side Effects While phenobarbital is also a prescription medication for humans, there are different dosages and side effects \u00a0for humans. If you accidentally ingest a medication intended for your pet, call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222. \u00a0 Monitoring Specific monitoring or routine testing while your pet is on this medication may be recommended by your veterinarian depending on your pet\u2019s individual needs, other medications they may be on and/or the issue that initially caused your pet to be placed on this medication. Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) Your pet\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of phenobarbital Phenobarbital Overdose Information Overdoses of phenobarbital can be life threatening. Symptoms of an overdose may include sedation, lethargy, lack of coordination, low blood pressure, low or high heart rate, low body temperature, decreased breathing rate, blue gums, or coma. If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian, seek emergency veterinary care, or contact an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply.
