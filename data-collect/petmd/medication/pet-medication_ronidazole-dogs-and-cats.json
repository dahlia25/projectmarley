Ronidazole is a prescription antiprotozoal medication used for intestinal protozoal infections that cause diarrhea, including Tritrichomonas foetus infections in cats and Giardia infections in dogs, as an alternative treatment when primary treatments have not been successful. Ronidazole is not currently FDA-approved nor commercially available in the United States. In certain circumstances, your veterinarian may be able to prescribe a compounded formulation if available at a reputable veterinary compounding pharmacy. In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of ronidazole. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. Ronidazole should not be used in animals that are sensitive to the medication or other medications categorized in the same antiprotozoal drug class, such as metronidazole. It is best to discuss your pet\u2019s medications and medical conditions with your veterinarian first before giving ronidazole, as there may be health risks to your pet if they are taking certain other medications. This medication should not be used in farmed animals. How Ronidazole Works Protozoa are microscopic single-celled parasites that cause infection and disease in the gastrointestinal system. Ronidazole and other medications in its 5-nitroimidazole drug class, such as metronidazole, kill protozoa by generating free radicals that disrupt their DNA. Ronidazole Directions Follow the directions as provided by your veterinarian. Ronidazole can be given with or without food, but giving it with food can decrease the risk of digestive upset. Ronidazole should not be used in animals that are sensitive to it or other 5-nitroimidazole drugs like metronidazole. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of ronidazole. Generally, they may instruct you to give it when you remember, or if it is almost time for your pet\u2019s next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses.
