This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Theophylline? Theophylline is a prescription medication that helps widen the airways to improve the flow of air into the lungs. This medication is used in dogs with tracheal, asthma or airway disease, and may be prescribed for cats with asthma. Although rare, theophylline may also be prescribed for horses with asthma. \u00a0 How Theophylline Works Theophylline belongs to a class of medications called phosphodiesterase enzyme (PDE) inhibitors. Theophylline targets specific enzymes located on the airway muscles to help them widen and improve the flow of air into the lungs. It may also help the fine hairs (cilia) that line airways clear mucus more effectively and dry out excess mucus. Theophylline is FDA-approved for human use under the brand names Elixophyllin\u00ae and Theo-24\u00ae, as well as the generic theophylline. Theophylline is currently not FDA approved as a veterinary medication. However, it is readily utilized in the veterinary field, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs in animals in certain circumstances. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of Theophylline. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. Theophylline Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Theophylline can be given with or without food but giving with food can help prevent digestive upset. Do not give theophylline with high fat foods like cheese or butter because this can increase the rate of absorption of certain theophylline formulations. This may lead to more severe side effects. Missed a Dose? If you forget to give a dose of theophylline, give it when you remember. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. Theophylline Possible Side Effects Theophylline is generally well tolerated but side effects may include: Vomiting Difficulty sleeping Diarrhea Increased appetite Increased thirst and urination Difficulty breathing Tremors Nervousness Elevated heart rate Side effects in horses may include: Increased excitability Incoordination Excessive sweating Human Side Effects Theophylline is also a prescription medication for humans, frequently with dosages different from those prescribed for your pet by a veterinarian. Due to possible side effects, pets should not be given any medicine prescribed for humans. If you accidentally ingest a pet medication, call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222. \u00a0 Monitoring No specific monitoring is required for this medication, but your veterinarian may recommend routine testing depending on your pets&#039; individual needs, other medications they may be on and/or the issue that initially caused your pet to be placed on this medication. Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of theophylline Theophylline Overdose Information Overdoses of theophylline can be life threatening. Symptoms of an overdose may include elevated heart rates, abnormal heart rhythms, fever, electrolyte imbalances and seizures. If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian or an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply. Pet Poison Helpline (855) 764-7661 ASPCA Animal Poison Control (888) 426-4435 Theophylline Storage Theophylline should be stored at controlled temperatures between 59\u201386 F. Keep the container tightly closed in order to protect from moisture and light. Compounded medications should be stored according to the compounding pharmacy\u2019s label.
