This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Profender\u00ae? Profender\u00ae is a liquid parasiticide applied topically (to the skin) of a cat to treat tapeworm, hookworm and roundworm infections. It is FDA approved for use in kittens and cats older than 8 weeks of age and weighing 2.2 pounds or more. How Profender\u00ae Works Profender\u00ae is a topical product that contains two active ingredients: emodepside and praziquantel. Emodepside prevents neurotransmitters from working inside the worms\u2019 brain, which causes paralysis and death. The way praziquantel works against intestinal parasites is unclear, but it is suspected to interfere with the worms&#039; muscle integrity and causes paralysis. The deceased worms will either be defecated out or digested within the cat\u2019s digestive tract. Profender\u00ae Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Your veterinarian will determine the appropriate topical dosage based on your pet\u2019s weight. When ready to apply, part your cat\u2019s fur at the back of the neck that is close to the base of your cat\u2019s head, until the skin is visible. Place the tip of the tube on the skin and squeeze the entire contents of the tube directly onto the skin. Do not apply directly if hair coat is wet or to any irritated or broken skin. Do not allow any pets to lick the area for at least one hour after application. To prevent accidental ingestion of this product, children should not come in contact with the application site for 24 hours while the product is being absorbed. Missed a Dose? Profender\u00ae is typically given as a one-time treatment. It may be repeated after 30 days as needed to treat re-infection.\u00a0 Profender\u00ae Possible Side Effects If a pet in your household licks the product or site of application, they may experience vomiting and drooling.
