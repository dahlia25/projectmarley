This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Trazodone? Trazodone is a human antidepressant that is commonly used in the veterinary field to treat certain behavior disorders in dogs and cats. While trazodone is FDA-approved for human use, it is currently not FDA approved as a veterinary medication. However, it is readily utilized in the veterinary field, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs in animals in certain circumstances. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. \u00a0 Trazodone may help calm dogs that suffer from separation anxiety or are triggered by stressful events such as fireworks or veterinarian visits. Your veterinarian may also prescribe trazodone for your dog after surgery, especially if recovery requires resting in a crate or other confined space. It can be used alone but is frequently used in combination with other anxiety medications. \u00a0 In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of trazodone. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug.\u00a0Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs.\u00a0You can learn more about\u00a0compounded medications here. How Trazodone Works Trazodone works by increasing serotonin levels in an animal\u2019s central nervous system. Serotonin is a chemical messenger that works in the brain to regulate behavior and other bodily functions. Many common antidepressants, including selective serotonin\u00a0reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), also increase serotonin levels. Trazodone Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Your veterinarian will prescribe a dose based on your pet\u2019s body weight and the reason for its use. Depending on your pet\u2019s condition, your pet may need to take trazodone daily or only as needed for anxiety-provoking events (such as fireworks, thunderstorms, or veterinary visits). Give trazodone as directed, usually at least 90 minutes before a triggering event. Consult your veterinarian if your pet\u2019s condition has not improved after starting trazodone. Missed a Dose? If you forget to give a dose of trazodone, give it when you remember. However, if it is almost time for your next dose of the medication, skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses.  Trazodone Possible Side Effects Trazodone is well-tolerated by most pets. The most common side effects are related to the digestive system (vomiting, diarrhea, or nausea). Less common side effects may include the following: increased anxiety or agitation, aggression and increased heart rate may occur. Trazodone is often given with other behavioral drugs. Serotonin syndrome is a rare but serious condition that can occur when these drugs are given together, especially in large doses. Seek immediate emergency care if signs of serotonin syndrome occur: Vomiting or diarrhea Seizures Increased skin sensitivity (hyperesthesia) Depression Dilated pupils or blindness Vocalizations (whining, crying) Excessive drooling Trouble breathing Weakness or lack of coordination Disorientation Human Side Effects While this is a human prescription medication there are different dosages and side effects that can occur in humans. If you accidentally ingest a pet medication, call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222. Monitoring No specific monitoring is required for this medication, but your veterinarian may recommend routine testing depending on your pets&#039; individual needs, other medications they may be on and/or the issue that initially caused your pet to be placed on this medication. Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of Trazodone Trazodone Overdose Information An overdosage of trazodone may cause sedation, decreased energy level (lethargy), lack of coordination, and vomiting. Overdosage of trazodone in combination with other medications or supplements that affect serotonin levels could result in a serious condition called serotonin syndrome (see above). Immediate emergency treatment may be necessary. If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian or an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply. Pet Poison Helpline (855) 764-7661 ASPCA Animal Poison Control (888) 426-4435 Trazodone Storage Trazodone should be stored at controlled temperatures between 68-77 F and brief exposure to temperatures 59-86 F are acceptable. Keep the container tightly closed in order to protect from moisture and light. Compounded medications should be stored according to the compounding pharmacy\u2019s label.
