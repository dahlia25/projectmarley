This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Trifexis\u00ae? Trifexis\u00ae\u00a0is a chewable prescription medication used in dogs 8 weeks of age or older and at least 5 pounds to prevent and treat flea infestations, adult hookworm, adult roundworm, and adult whipworm infections. It is also used to prevent heartworm disease. How Trifexis\u00ae Works Trifexis\u00ae has two active ingredients, spinosad and milbemycin oxime. Spinosad works by causing an overload of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the insect\u2019s nervous system. Spinosad is highly selective for insect receptors. It begins to kill fleas in about 30 minutes and kills up to 100% of fleas on dogs within 4 hours. Milbemycin shifts chloride, a naturally occurring electrolyte, across the cell membrane of certain susceptible worms such as heartworms, roundworms, and hookworms. By overloading chloride into these worms, it affects the electrical activity within their nervous system, causing muscle paralysis and death. Mammals do not contain the same chloride movement channels as insects, which makes milbemycin an important ingredient in Trifexis\u00ae. Trifexis\u00ae Directions Trifexis\u00ae is a chewable tablet and is administered once a month with food. For heartworm prevention, the medication should be given once monthly for at least three months after exposure to mosquitoes. Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. If your dog vomits within an hour of administration, another full dose is recommended. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of Trifexis\u00ae. Generally, they will advise you to administer a dose with food as soon as you remember, and then continue a monthly schedule from that date. In most cases, do not give extra or double doses. Trifexis\u00ae Possible Side Effects Vomiting is the most common side effect seen with Trifexis\u00ae. This side effect can be lessened when Trifexis\u00ae is given on a full stomach, which also helps the body to absorb the medication. Other side effects include: Fatigue (lethargy) Lack of appetite Itching Diarrhea Red ears or skin Drooling Trembling Loss of coordination Seizures If you believe your animal may be experiencing any side effects, consult your veterinarian. Human Side Effects This medication is not used in humans. If you accidentally ingest a pet medication, call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222.\u00a0 Monitoring Prior to administration of Trifexis\u00ae, your dog should be tested for existing heartworm infection. While no specific monitoring is required for this medication, your veterinarian may recommend routine testing depending on your dog\u2019s individual needs, other medications they may be on, or the issue that initially caused your pet to be placed on this medication. Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) Your dog\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of Trifexis\u00ae Trifexis\u00ae Overdose Information Symptoms of an overdose of Trifexis\u00ae are very similar to the listed side effects above, with vomiting as the most common sign of an overdose. Additional symptoms may include drooling, tremors, fatigue (lethargy), and coughing. If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian, seek emergency veterinary care, or contact an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply.
