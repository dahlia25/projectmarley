This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Drontal\u00ae? Drontal\u00ae and Drontal\u00ae Plus are prescription deworming medications used to treat and prevent intestinal parasites. Drontal\u00ae is intended for use in cats and kittens, while Drontal\u00ae Plus is specifically formulated for use in dogs and puppies. These products are available in several formulations and strengths, including Drontal\u00ae oral tablets for cats and Drontal\u00ae Plus oral tablets or chews for dogs. Drontal\u00ae Plus for Dogs Drontal\u00ae Plus is used in dogs and puppies ages 3 weeks and older and weighing more than 2 pounds. Drontal\u00ae Plus is prescribed for the treatment of multiple species of tapeworms, hookworms, roundworms, and whipworms in dogs. Drontal\u00ae for Cats Drontal\u00ae is used in cats and kittens ages 8 weeks and older and weighing more than two pounds. Drontal is indicated for the treatment of tapeworms, hookworms, and roundworms in cats. Drontal\u00ae and Drontal\u00ae Plus are available by prescription only and should be given after the presence of susceptible intestinal parasites has been confirmed by laboratory fecal testing in your dog or cat. It is important to note that tapeworms are transmitted by fleas. Without proper flea prevention measures, tapeworm reinfections can occur. How Drontal\u00ae and Drontal\u00ae Plus Works Drontal\u00ae and Drontal\u00ae Plus both contain the ingredients praziquantel and pyrantel. The way in which praziquantel works against intestinal parasites is not entirely known, but it is suspected that it interferes with the worms\u2019 muscle integrity and causes paralysis. The worms then detach and are either destroyed in the digestive tract by the pet\u2019s immune system or passed through to be defecated out. Pyrantel works in a similar way in that it affects the parasites\u2019 nerves and causes paralysis of the worm. The deceased worms will either be defecated out or digested within the pet\u2019s digestive tract. Drontal\u00ae Plus contains the additional ingredient febantel. Febantel is converted to fenbendazole in the dog\u2019s body. Fenbendazole blocks the ability of worms to produce energy, which ultimately starves and kills the parasite. This allows for coverage against whipworms in dogs. Drontal\u00ae Plus is also available as Drontal\u00ae Plus Taste Tabs, which have the same active ingredients but are a tasty alternative to those pets who do not prefer taking pill medications.
