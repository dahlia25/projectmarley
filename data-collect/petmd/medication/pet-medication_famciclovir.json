This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Famciclovir? Famciclovir is a human antiviral medication that is commonly used in the veterinary field to treat herpes infections in cats. While famciclovir is not a cure, it can help improve symptoms and decrease shedding of the virus. How Famciclovir Works Famciclovir is an antiviral medication. It works by blocking the virus\u2019s ability to make more DNA and replicate. It will not kill the viruses that are currently circulating in the body, but it can prevent the virus from replicating out of control. Famciclovir is FDA-approved for human use. Famciclovir is currently not FDA approved as a veterinary medication. However, it is readily utilized in the veterinary field, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs for use in animals in certain circumstances. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. In certain circumstances, your veterinarian may recommend a compounded formulation of famciclovir. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. Famciclovir Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Your veterinarian will determine the appropriate dose. This medication is generally given twice daily without food.

In most cases, they may instruct you to not give extra or double doses. Famciclovir Possible Side Effects Famciclovir is generally well tolerated. Side effects may include: Diarrhea Increased thirst Increased urination Weight loss Vomiting If you believe your pet is experiencing any side effects, consult your veterinarian. Human Side Effects While this is also a human prescription medication, there are different dosages and side effects that can occur in humans. \u00a0If you accidentally ingest a pet medication, immediately seek medical attention, or call the\u00a0\u00a0 national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222. \u00a0 Monitoring Specific monitoring or routine testing while your pet is on this medication may be recommended by your veterinarian depending on your pets&#039; individual needs, other medications they may be on and/or the issue that initially caused your pet to be placed on this medication.
