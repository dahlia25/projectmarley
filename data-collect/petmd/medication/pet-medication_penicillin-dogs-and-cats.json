This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Penicillin? Penicillin is an antibiotic that treats susceptible bacterial infections in dogs, cats, cattle, horses, and swine. Penicillin G Procaine, the injectable form, is FDA-approved for use in horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, and cats for respiratory tract infections and in swine for infections of the skin. Penicillin G injection is sometimes used in dogs for certain bacterial infections, including leptospirosis. Penicillin V, the oral form, is rarely used in veterinary medicine because it must be given several times a day on an empty stomach. \u00a0\u00a0 Penicillin V and Penicillin V Potassium are FDA-approved for human use as generic Penicillin V tablets or as a powder mixed with water to create an oral liquid. Penicillin V is currently not FDA-approved as a veterinary medication. However, while it is rarely utilized in the veterinary field, veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs in animals in certain circumstances. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. Your veterinarian will determine whether this medication is right for your pet. How Penicillin Works Penicillin prevents susceptible bacterium from creating a necessary part of its cell wall, thereby weakening and destroying it, causing the bacterium to die. Penicillin Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Penicillin V is best given without food. If your pet experiences stomach upset when taking this medication, giving it with a small amount of food can help.\u00a0 Penicillin V oral suspension is a liquid version of penicillin and is usually supplied as a powder. Follow the mixing directions closely and note the exact amount of water that should be mixed with the powder to create the suspension. Shake well. Storing mixed penicillin in the refrigerator is preferred. Any unused portion of the suspension should be discarded after 14 days. Always confirm storage requirements by reading the prescription label. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of penicillin. Generally, they may instruct you to give it when you remember, or if it is almost time for your pet\u2019s next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. Penicillin Possible Side Effects Like all other antibiotics, penicillin can cause gastrointestinal side effects:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Vomiting\u00a0 Diarrhea\u00a0 Loss of appetite Penicillin allergies in animals are rare but can happen. Symptoms may include:\u00a0 Skin rashes Fever\u00a0 Collapse\u00a0 Difficulty breathing\u00a0 Penicillin V, the oral form, should not be used in horses, rabbits, guinea pigs, gerbils, hamsters, and chinchillas as life-threatening diarrhea can occur in these species.\u00a0 Human Side Effects Penicillin is also a prescription medication for humans, frequently with dosages and side effects different from those prescribed for your pet by a veterinarian. If you accidentally ingest a pet medication, call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If you are allergic to penicillin, talk to your veterinarian about using another medication or ensure that you always wear gloves while in contact with this medication.\u00a0 Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) Your pet\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of penicillin Penicillin Overdose Information An overdose of penicillin is unlikely to cause toxicity. Penicillin may cause vomiting, diarrhea, and decreased appetite. Large overdoses and prolonged use of penicillin may cause a lack of coordination, seizures, breathing problems, fluid retention, and rapid heart rate.\u00a0 Penicillin allergies in pets are rare but can happen. Signs of an allergic reaction include skin reactions, watery eyes, hives (urticaria), facial swelling, vomiting, diarrhea, and anaphylaxis. If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian, seek emergency veterinary care, or call an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply.
