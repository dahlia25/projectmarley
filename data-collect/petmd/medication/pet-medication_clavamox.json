Come to petMD for a complete list of pet medications and prescriptions.", "articleBody": "General Description Clavamox\u00a0is a drug containing both Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid. Amoxicillin is a version of penicillin that is able to last longer, resist stomach acid, and kill both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. It is often used to prevent and treat infections found in cuts and wounds, the mouth, the upper respiratory system, and the bladder. Amoxicillin also has better absorption than another predecessor, Ampicillin. It is possible for bacteria to build resistance to Ampicillin, as the Staphylococci group of bacteria already has. Amoxicillin may be used in conjunction with clavulanic acid (as in Clavamox\u00ae) to be effective against Staphylococci as well as other bacteria. Clavulanic acid makes this compound effective against a wider variety of bacteria by stopping the mechanisms the bacteria has against Amoxicillin. This drug should be given for at least 7-10 days to be effective. \u00a0 How It Works Amoxicillin kills bacteria by preventing them from building a proper cell wall while they grow. It accomplishes this by inhibiting the linking of peptidoglycan chains that are a major component in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria\u2019s cell walls. Clavulanic acid inhibits an enzyme that bacteria produces called beta-lactamase. Beta-lactamase has the ability to deactivate Amoxicillin, and by halting this, Clavamox\u00a0is more effective against more bacteria. Storage Information Store tablets in a tightly sealed container at room temperature. Keep oral liquid refrigerated- it will remain effective 10 days after mixed. Missed Dose? Give the dose as soon as possible. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose, and continue with the regular schedule. Do not give your pet two doses at once.
