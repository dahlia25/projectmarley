This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Seresto\u00ae? Seresto\u00ae pet collars help protect your dog or cat from fleas and ticks. The collars slowly and continuously release two active ingredients (flumethrin and imidacloprid) over the course of 8 months. These active ingredients repel and kill fleas and ticks in dogs and cats. Seresto\u00ae cat collars help to repel and kill fleas and ticks in cats and kittens 10 weeks and older. For puppies and dogs 7 weeks and older, Seresto\u00ae helps repel and kill fleas, ticks, and chewing lice. Seresto\u00ae can also be used as part of a treatment plan for dogs affected by sarcoptic mange. Talk to your veterinarian to determine if Seresto\u00ae is a good choice for your pet. Pets with flea-bite dermatitis or hypersensitivity to flea bites may scratch relentlessly and suffer from skin disease. Fleas and ticks also transmit several infectious diseases, including Lyme disease, tick fever, bartonellosis, tapeworms, and more. How Seresto\u00ae Works Seresto\u00ae collars contain 4.5% flumethrin and 10% imidacloprid. The collar slowly and continuously releases these active ingredients onto your pet\u2019s skin over 8 months. The active ingredients spread along the pet\u2019s skin and haircoat to help protect against external parasites. In dogs and cats, Seresto\u00ae kills and repels fleas. After applying the collar, Seresto\u00ae kills fleas already on your pet\u2019s body within 24 hours. If your pet continuously wears the Seresto\u00ae collar over the next 8 months, any new fleas that land on your pet will be killed within 2 hours. Seresto\u00ae kills fleas before they can lay eggs, which helps reduce flea larvae in the pet\u2019s environment. However, immature fleas, or flea pupae that are already in the environment are not affected, allowing fleas to emerge in the environment for six weeks or more. According to the Seresto\u00ae label susceptible ticks include deer ticks, American dog ticks, brown dog ticks, and Lone Star ticks. Seresto\u00ae may not kill ticks that are already on your pet before using the collar. Remove any existing ticks. Prevention of new ticks starts within 48 hours of applying the collar. After that, new ticks are repelled or killed in as fast as 6 hours. Seresto\u00ae kills chewing lice and treats and controls sarcoptic mange in dogs. Seresto\u00ae Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. See product packaging for complete instructions and helpful illustrations. Step 1: Open packaging only when ready to use the collar. Break and remove all plastic connectors that hold the collar in a coil in the packaging. Step 2: Fasten one Seresto\u00ae collar around your pet\u2019s neck. Insert the end of the collar through the buckle, and then tighten it until you can comfortably insert only two fingers between the collar and the neck. This ensures that the collar is neither too tight nor too loose. Periodically check and adjust the fit of the collar, especially in growing puppies and kittens. Step 3: Secure the excess length of the collar through the attached loop. Trim any excess that extends one inch beyond the loop. However, you may wish to leave some extra length to allow for growth in puppies and kittens. Step 4: Seresto\u00ae collars include optional light reflectors that increase your pet\u2019s visibility at night. Attach the three reflective clips at equal distances along the collar, and squeeze until a click is heard. These reflective clips will be permanently secured. Seresto\u00ae collars are water resistant and remain effective after bathing and swimming. However, the collars do not work as long with repeated exposure to water. Replace the collar after 5 months in dogs that swim regularly or get bathed more than once per month. Missed a Dose? Replace your pet\u2019s Seresto\u00ae collar every 8 months (or every 5 months if your pet swims or is bathed more than once per month). The collars are designed to widen in order to quickly release your pet if it ever gets trapped. If this occurs or if the collar is lost, replace it immediately with a new collar.\u00a0  Seresto\u00ae Possible Side Effects Some pets will scratch at the collar for a few days until they get used to it. Check to make sure the collar is not too tight. Rubbing under the collar can cause slight hair loss and mild skin redness. These signs should improve in 1-2 weeks without having to remove the collar but talk to your veterinarian if these signs do not resolve. Rarely, more severe skin reactions can occur, including skin inflammation and eczema. Remove the collar if skin inflammation or changes are seen. Consult your veterinarian immediately if the irritation is severe or if it does not resolve after collar removal. Do not place the collar into your pet\u2019s mouth or eyes. Keep the collar out of the reach of children.
