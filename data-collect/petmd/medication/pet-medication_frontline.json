How Do Frontline\u00ae Plus, Frontline\u00ae Gold and Frontline\u00ae Shield for Dogs Work? The 2 main active ingredients in all Frontline\u00ae products are fipronil and (S)-methoprene. Fipronil works by blocking certain messenger channels in the insects\u2019 nervous system, which causes overstimulation and death. (S)-methoprene is chemically similar to a naturally occurring growth hormone found in insects. This similarity allows (S)-methoprene to insert itself into larvae, which blocks their growth into adulthood. It also prevents eggs from being produced in the female insect. An additional active ingredient in Frontline\u00ae Shield and Gold products is pyriproxyfen. Pyriproxyfen is also chemically similar to the insect growth hormone chemical.
