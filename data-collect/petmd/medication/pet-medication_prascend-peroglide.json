Prascend\u00ae is the only FDA-approved drug for the control of clinical signs associated with Cushing\u2019s Disease in horses, also known as pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID). Prascend\u00ae is the brand name for the generic medication pergolide. Prascend\u00ae will not cure a horse of PPID, but it can help manage the symptoms associated with this disease. How Prascend\u00ae Works Prascend\u00ae belongs to a class of medications called dopamine agonists, which mimic dopamine in the body. Horses with PPID do not make enough dopamine, a communication molecule in the brain that controls the secretion of hormones from the pituitary gland. In the presence of dopamine or a dopamine agonist like Prascend\u00ae, the pituitary gland will stop overproducing hormones that cause the symptoms of PPID. In certain circumstances, your veterinarian may recommend a compounded formulation of Pergolide\u00ae. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your horse\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your horse has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the horse is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. Prascend\u00ae Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Prascend\u00ae is typically given by mouth once daily and often begins with a gradual increase in dose until desired levels are reached to help prevent loss of appetite\u2014which is common with this medication. Your veterinarian may also recommend reducing their dose over time as they monitor how your horse is responding to the medication. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of Prascend\u00ae. Generally, they may advise you to give it when you remember, or if it is almost time for your next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. In most cases, do not give extra or double doses. Prascend\u00ae Possible Side Effects The most common side effect with Prascend\u00ae is a loss of appetite that can occur at the beginning of treatment, but this side effect may persist throughout treatment. It is important to work with your veterinarian if you notice your horse is losing their appetite once they begin this medication.
