This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Capstar\u00ae?  Capstar\u00ae (nitenpyram) is a fast-acting, oral medication used to treat fleas in cats and dogs. Capstar\u00ae kills adult fleas before they can lay eggs and cause an infestation. The medication begins working within 30 minutes of application and kills over 90% of adult fleas within a few hours. If fleas have already infested your pet\u2019s coat, Capstar\u00ae can be safely combined with other flea prevention treatments that kill immature fleas on the pet and in the environment. How Capstar\u00ae Works A single, female adult flea can lay as many as 2,000 eggs during her lifetime. These eggs develop into larvae, then pupae, and finally into adults within three weeks. Capstar\u00ae stops this cycle by killing adult fleas before they can lay eggs. Because it does not treat the immature stages of fleas, additional doses of Capstar\u00ae and other preventative flea medications may be necessary to eliminate infestations. Capstar\u00ae Directions Capstar\u00ae is available in three forms: 11.4 mg for cats between 2-25 pounds11.4 mg for small dogs between 2-25 pounds57 mg for large dogs between 25.1-125 poundsBe sure to know your pet\u2019s accurate weight to determine which size of Capstar\u00ae your pet needs. It\u2019s important to give the correct dosage based on your pet\u2019s weight. Refer to instruction label on box for complete information. Missed a Dose? A single dose of Capstar\u00ae should kill adult fleas on your pet. However, if your pet has a flea re-infestation, it is safe to give another dose of Capstar\u00ae up to once daily as needed to kill adult fleas. If you are unsure whether your pet swallowed the tablet, an additional dose may be administered. Capstar\u00ae Possible Side Effects Your dog or cat may start scratching itself after receiving Capstar\u00ae. This is typically because of the pet\u2019s reaction to the fleas, not the medication itself. Scratching is usually temporary. Serious side effects (such as seizures, incoordination, or death) are more likely in animals that weigh less than 2 pounds, are younger than 8 weeks of age, or are already in poor health. Do not administer Capstar\u00ae without consulting with your veterinarian if your pet weighs less than 2 pounds. Consult with your veterinarian before use if your pet is ill or has a health condition.
