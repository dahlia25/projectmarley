This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Tamsulosin? Tamsulosin is a prescription medication that can be used in dogs and cats with specific conditions that require the urethra and the ureters of the lower urinary tract to relax. Tamsulosin may also help with the passage of small bladder stones, treating functional urinary tract obstruction, benign overgrowth of the prostate, and urethral spasms that occur from a\u00a0urinary tract obstruction (UTI). Tamsulosin is FDA-approved for human use under the brand name Flomax\u00ae and the generic, tamsulosin. Tamsulosin is currently not FDA-approved as a veterinary medication. However, it is readily utilized in the veterinary field, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs in animals in some circumstances. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. Your veterinarian will determine whether this medication is right for your pet. How Tamsulosin Works Tamsulosin is categorized as an alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist. Tamsulosin specifically targets the 1A receptors found in the bladder, urethra, and prostate, which are responsible for relaxing the smooth muscles in these areas. Relaxing these muscles aids in the passage of stones and urine. Tamsulosin Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Tamsulosin is generally given once daily by mouth in both dogs and cats. Tamsulosin is available as a capsule that should not be crushed. Ensure that your pet swallows the capsule whole and does not chew on it.\u00a0 Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of tamsulosin. Generally, they may instruct you to give it when you remember, or if it is almost time for your next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. Tamsulosin Possible Side Effects Since tamsulosin is not commonly prescribed in pets, the list of known side effects is small.
