Come to petMD for a complete list of pet medications and prescriptions.", "articleBody": "General Description Loperamide is used to treat diarrhea and acute colitis in humans, but may be prescribed to pets. It is also effective in malabsorption and maldigestion in pets that are not extracting enough nutrients from their food. It is a non-addictive weak narcotic. Treatment typically should not last longer than 2 days. If your pets has diarrhea for more than 48 hours, contact your veterinarian immediately to prevent dehydration. How It Works The muscles in the stomach contract to pass food at a certain pace known as it\u2019s motility. Loperamide works by decreasing the motility, slowing the passage of food through the digestive tract. This also allows increased absorption of water and nutrients, reducing the fluid in the stool which leads to less diarrhea. Storage Information Store in a tightly sealed container at room temperature. Missed Dose? Give the dose as soon as possible. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose, and continue with the regular schedule. Do not give your pet two doses at once.
