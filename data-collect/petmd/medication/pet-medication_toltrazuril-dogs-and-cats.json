This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Toltrazuril? Toltrazuril is a prescription antiprotozoal\u00a0medication. It has been used by veterinarians to treat coccidiosis, an intestinal protozoal infection that typically causes diarrhea in dogs and cats. Coccidiosis most commonly affects puppies and kittens, especially in a shelter environment. Toltrazuril has also been used for treating the shedding stage of toxoplasmosis in cats. The drug \u00a0has not been FDA-approved for any use. It is important to note that another drug, Albon\u00ae (sulfadimethoxine), is the only FDA-approved drug for the treatment of coccidiosis in dogs and cats. However, some coccidia strains may have developed resistance to Albon\u00ae over time, which means using Albon\u00ae to treat coccidia may not be as effective as it once was. The use of an alternative antiprotozoal medication, such as toltrazuril or ponazuril, may be ordered by a veterinarian where Albon\u00ae has not been effective. Toltrazuril is not currently FDA-approved or available in the United States. In certain circumstances, your veterinarian may be able to order it from a reputable veterinary compounding pharmacy. In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of toltrazuril. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. How Toltrazuril Works Coccidia belong to a subclass of parasites called protozoa that cause infection and disease in the gastrointestinal system. Toltrazuril is a medication that destroys all life stages of coccidia. It interferes with the coccidia\u2019s abilities to multiply, form a cell wall, and make the proteins necessary for their survival, thereby destroying the coccidia. Toltrazuril Directions Follow the directions as provided by your veterinarian. Toltrazuril can be given with or without food, but giving it with food can decrease the risk of digestive upset. Toltrazuril should not be used in animals who are sensitive to it, or with other medications categorized in the same antiprotozoal drug class such as ponazuril. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of toltrazuril. Generally, they may instruct you to give it when you remember, or if it is almost time for your pet\u2019s next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses.
