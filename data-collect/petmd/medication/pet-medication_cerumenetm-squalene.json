This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Cerumene\u2122? Cerumene\u2122 is an over-the-counter (no prescription needed) ear-cleaning liquid for dogs and cats. It softens and loosens earwax buildup in dog and cat ear canals. This product makes it easier to remove earwax with at-home ear cleanings or deep flushes performed by your veterinarian. When used regularly, Cerumene\u2122 can help keep earwax from accumulating. How Cerumene\u2122 Works Cerumene\u2122 contains 25% squalene in a thick liquid base of mineral oil and isopropyl myristate. Squalene helps soften and loosen earwax (also known as cerumen) that has built up in a dog or cat\u2019s ear canals. This makes it easier to remove the earwax, usually with water or another ear cleaner you can buy over the counter. If used routinely (1-2 times per month), Cerumene\u2122 can help prevent the buildup of earwax. Cerumene\u2122 is not an ear medication and does not treat ear infections. However, your veterinarian may recommend Cerumene\u2122 to clean your pet\u2019s ears before treatment with an ear medication. This may make ear medications work better by making it easier for them to reach areas of the ear canal that are blocked by debris. Cerumene\u2122 Directions Follow the directions on the product label or as provided by your veterinarian. Ask your veterinarian to demonstrate how to clean your pet\u2019s ears and follow their directions. Typical directions for Cerumene\u2122 may include: Gently but firmly hold your pet\u2019s ear at the base. Flip up the earflap to expose the opening to the ear canal.Pour a few drops of liquid Cerumene\u2122 into the ear canal. The product is thick; only a small amount is usually necessary.Gently massage the base of the ear for several minutes. \u00a0Allow your pet to shake their head. Dislodged earwax and some ear cleaner may come out.Wipe excess ear cleaner or debris with a clean, soft cloth or cotton ball. Do not insert cotton applicators (like Q-tips\u00ae) or anything else into the ear canal.Repeat treatment as directed by your veterinarian.Stop using Cerumene\u2122 and contact your veterinarian if your pet\u2019s ears become red, warm, swollen, or otherwise irritated after use. Missed a Dose? If you forget to use Cerumene\u2122, please use it again\u00a0as soon as you remember and resume the schedule as directed by your veterinarian. Do not use more than directed by your veterinarian. Cerumene\u2122 Possible Side Effects Cerumene\u2122 is usually well tolerated and is unlikely to cause side effects.
