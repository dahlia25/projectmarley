This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Voriconazole? Voriconazole is an antifungal medication used to treat fungal or yeast infections in dogs, horses, birds, reptiles, and rarely cats. Voriconazole is rarely used for bodywide (systemic) infections from organisms such as Cryptococcus, Valley Fever (coccidioidomycosis), Aspergillus, and blastomycosis. Cats are prone to severe side effects with voriconazole such as liver toxicity, which is why it is not commonly prescribed for cats. Other antifungals, like itraconazole or fluconazole, have fewer side effects and may be recommended as an alternative to voriconazole. How Voriconazole Works Voriconazole works as an antifungal medication by interrupting the fungus\u2019s ability to create an enzyme needed to produce its cell membrane. This blocks its metabolism and growth. Voriconazole is FDA-approved for human use under the brand name Vfend\u00ae and the generic voriconazole. Voriconazole is currently not FDA-approved as a veterinary medication. However, while it is infrequently used in the veterinary field, veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs in animals in certain circumstances. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. Your veterinarian will determine whether this medication is right for your pet. In certain circumstances, your veterinarian may recommend a compounded formulation of voriconazole. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. Voriconazole Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Since food may decrease the absorption of voriconazole, it is best given on an empty stomach, at least one hour before or after a meal. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of voriconazole. They may instruct you to give it when you remember or, if it is almost time for your next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. Voriconazole Possible Side Effects Since this medication is rarely used in veterinary medicine, not all side effects with this medication are known. Some pets may be more sensitive to this medication than others and experience greater side effects. For example, cats are more prone to experiencing voriconazole\u2019s severe side effects, which is why it is not often prescribed for cats. \u00a0 Side effects may include: Vomiting Diarrhea Loss of appetite Weight loss Lethargy Incoordination Liver irritation Symptoms of liver irritation may include: Vomiting Loss of interest in food Yellow gums, skin or whites of the eyes Human Side Effects While this is a human prescription medication, there are different dosages and side effects that can occur in humans. \u00a0If you accidentally ingest a medication prescribed for your pet, call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222. \u00a0 Monitoring Specific monitoring or routine testing while your pet is on this medication may be recommended by your veterinarian depending on your pet\u2019s individual needs, other medications they may be on, and/or the issue that initially caused your pet to be placed on this medication. Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) Your pet\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of voriconazole Voriconazole Overdose Information Since voriconazole is not commonly used in veterinary medicine, not all signs of a possible overdose are known. Signs to monitor may include vomiting, diarrhea, drooling, pupil dilation, light aversion, lethargy, difficulty breathing or seizures.
