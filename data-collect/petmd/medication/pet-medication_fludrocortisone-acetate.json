This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Fludrocortisone Acetate? Fludrocortisone acetate is a mineralocorticoid prescription medication used off-label in the treatment of hypoadrenocorticism, also called adrenal gland insufficiency or Addison\u2019s Disease, in dogs\u00a0and cats.\u00a0Fludrocortisone may also be useful in ferrets that have had an adrenal gland removed. How Fludrocortisone Acetate Works The adrenal glands produce several types of chemical messengers and two types of natural steroids: mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. Mineralocorticoids are important in directing the kidney to properly regulate electrolytes and water levels in the body. Glucocorticoids are responsible for producing the hormones and steroids the body needs for \u201cfight or flight\u201d-type responses. In pets with hypoadrenocorticism, the adrenal glands do not produce enough of these steroids. Fludrocortisone is a synthetic corticosteroid that replaces some of both of those types but is much stronger at replacing mineralocorticoids. Fludrocortisone is FDA-approved for human use under the brand name Florinef\u00ae and the generic fludrocortisone. Fludrocortisone is currently not FDA-approved as a veterinary medication. However, it is readily utilized in the veterinary field, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs in animals under certain circumstances. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of fludrocortisone. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. Fludrocortisone Acetate Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Fludrocortisone is generally given once to twice a day. Fludrocortisone can be given with or without food, but if your pet has digestive upset when taking this medication on an empty stomach, try giving it with a small meal. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of fludrocortisone. Generally, they may advise you to give it when you remember, or if it is almost time for your next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. Fludrocortisone Acetate Possible Side Effects Side effects of fludrocortisone are generally related to its effects on the adrenal glands and its ability to help the body to produce its own natural steroids and can include: Increased thirst and urination Increased appetite Weight gain Swelling of the abdomen Thinning of the hair coat If a pet is on a dose of fludrocortisone that is too low, you may see continuing signs of hypoadrenocortism, which may include: Vomiting Weakness Loss of appetite Diarrhea Fludrocortisone should be used with caution in pregnant pets or those with heart failure, kidney disease or swelling. Human Side Effects While fludrocortisone is a human prescription medication, there are different dosages and side effects that can occur in humans. \u00a0If you accidentally ingest fludrocortisone prescribed to your pet, call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222. \u00a0 Monitoring Specific monitoring or routine testing while your pet is on this medication may be recommended by your veterinarian depending on your pet\u2019s individual needs, other medications they may be on, and/or the issue that initially caused your pet to be placed on this medication.

Life-threatening changes in your pet\u2019s electrolytes are possible. Swelling of the limbs, high blood pressure, and general weakness can be seen.
