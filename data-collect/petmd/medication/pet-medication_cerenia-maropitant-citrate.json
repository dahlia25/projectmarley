This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Cerenia\u00ae? Cerenia\u00ae is the only drug approved by the FDA for use in dogs to help prevent and treat vomiting caused by motion sickness. Cerenia\u00ae is also used to treat acute nausea and vomiting in dogs and can alleviate nausea associated with chemotherapy. The injectable formulation is FDA approved for use in both dogs and cats, but the tablets are only approved by the FDA for use in dogs at this time. Many veterinarians may use the tablets as a treatment for vomiting in an off-label manner, meaning in a way that has not been approved by the FDA. This is called extra-label, or sometimes off-label use, because this use is not described on the drug label.  How Cerenia\u00ae Works Cerenia\u00ae does not target the stomach to decrease nausea. It specifically targets the part of the brain that triggers vomiting (called the emetic center). Due to this effect on the brain, Cerenia\u00ae is a potent drug that can treat and prevent vomiting from a wide variety of causes. Cerenia\u00ae Directions Generally, to prevent vomiting associated with motion sickness in dogs, administer this medication to your dog, with a small amount of food, at least 2 hours prior to traveling.
