This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Toceranib (Palladia\u00ae)? Toceranib (brand name Palladia\u00ae) is an FDA-approved prescription veterinary anti-cancer medication for treatment of grade II and grade III mast cell tumors (MCTs) in dogs. It has also been used off-label to treat a wide variety of other cancers in dogs, such as sarcomas, carcinomas such as bladder cancer and mammary cancer, anal sac adenocarcinoma, melanomas, and bone marrow cancer (multiple myeloma). It is currently recommended as a solo medication for certain cancers in dogs, but veterinarians combine it with other anti-cancer treatments. Toceranib has also been used off-label to treat certain cancers in cats. The term off-label use means that a medication is used in a way or in a particular species that is not specified on the FDA-approved drug label. Your veterinarian will determine whether this medication is right for your pet. Toceranib is available from the manufacturer as an oral tablet. In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of toceranib. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. Toceranib (Palladia\u00ae) Considerations Due to the potential risk of toxicity to pets, veterinary staff, and pet parents, and because chemotherapy treatment protocols and monitoring guidelines often change, it is best to consult with a board-certified veterinary oncologist about the use of toceranib in your pet. If they determine toceranib to be an appropriate treatment option, they will also recommend an appropriate dose and schedule for your pet. Treatment with toceranib requires intensive monitoring and close supervision by your veterinarian. Before and during your pet\u2019s treatment, your vet will perform blood and urine tests to evaluate their immune system function as well as the effects of the drug on the liver and kidneys. Toceranib should not be used in pets that are less than 24 months of age or that weigh less than 11 pounds, or in pets that are pregnant or nursing. Toceranib should not be used three days before surgery or up to two weeks after surgery, as it can prolong healing time and increase the risks of swelling and blood clots. Giving toceranib with certain medications can result in health risks to your pet, so it is important to discuss your pet\u2019s medications and medical conditions with your veterinarian. How Toceranib (Palladia\u00ae) Works Toceranib belongs to a class of medications known as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Toceranib is an anti-cancer medication but it is not considered chemotherapy, as it does not directly kill rapidly dividing cancer cells. Toceranib works by blocking tyrosine kinase receptors on the surface of cancer cells and nearby blood vessels. This cuts off the cancer\u2019s blood vessel supply, thereby removing its source of oxygen and nutrients that are key to its survival. Toceranib (Palladia\u00ae) Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Wear gloves when handling toceranib phosphate. Do not break, split, or crush tablets. Toceranib can be given with or without food, but giving it with food can decrease the risk of digestive upset. Toceranib should be avoided in pregnant and lactating pets. Missed a Dose? The dosing schedule for toceranib is highly specific to your pet and depends on their medical needs and the type of cancer or condition being treated. Speak with your veterinarian right away about what to do if you forget to give a dose of toceranib. Do not give extra or double doses. Toceranib (Palladia\u00ae) Possible Side Effects Side effects of toceranib may include: Gastrointestinal upset\u2014diarrhea, decreased appetite, vomiting Low energy (lethargy) Weight loss Fresh blood in vomit or stools Black tarry stools Bleeding and bruising Toceranib has a moderate duration, which means its side effects may last for several days, even after you have stopped administering the medication to your pet. Side effects may last for a longer time in animals with liver or kidney disease. Human Side Effects Toceranib is a veterinary anti-cancer drug that is not used in humans. It can be hazardous to other animals and people who encounter it.
