Ponazuril is an FDA-approved oral paste used to treat equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM) in horses, which is caused by Sarcocysitis neruona. Ponazuril can also be used to treat other protozoal infections (such as Coccidia, Neospora, Eimeria, Toxoplasma and Cryptosporidium) in other species including dogs, cats, goats, camels, small mammals, and reptiles through off-label use. The term off- or extra- label use means that a medication is prescribed for a certain use or for a particular species that is not specified on the medication label. Veterinarians can legally prescribe medications for off-label use in certain circumstances. Your veterinarian will determine whether this medication is right for your pet. In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of ponazuril. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. How Ponazuril Works Ponazuril is an antiprotozoal medication that blocks specific enzymes in the protozoa from working and decreases the formation of pyrimidine, which is an essential building block of its DNA. Interruptions in DNA formation will cause the protozoa to die. Ponazuril Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Ponazuril is a paste that is generally given once daily by mouth over a course of several days. The length of time that your pet will be administered this medication will depend on the species being treated, type of infection, and your pet\u2019s symptoms. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of ponazuril. Generally, they may instruct you to give it when you remember or, if it is almost time for your next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses.
