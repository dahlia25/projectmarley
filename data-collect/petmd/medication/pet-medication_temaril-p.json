Come to petMD for a complete list of pet medications.", "articleBody": "General Description Trimeprazine acts as an anti-itch and cough suppressant, while prednisolone acts as an anti-inflammatory agent. Temaril-P\u00ae may be used to treat to animals with acute or chronic bacterial infections that are already being treated with antibiotics or chemotherapy. This drug is also often used to treat skin disorders of dogs. It often relieves itchiness that other drugs have been unsuccessful against. Temaril-P\u00ae is also used to treat various cough conditions of dogs including kennel cough, tracheobronchitis bronchitis including all allergic bronchitis, and coughs of nonspecific origin. How It Works Trimeprazine is an antihistamine with a sedative. Antihistamines counteract histamine, which is a chemical released to cause inflammation and itchiness as part of an allergic reaction. Prednisolone is a corticosteroid. Corticosteroids are meant to resemble a naturally occurring hormone produced in the adrenal cortex, cortisol. Corticosteroids act on the immune system by blocking the production of substances that trigger inflammatory and immune responses. Storage Information Store in a cool, dry place at room temperature.
