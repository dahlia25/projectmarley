This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Benazepril? Benazepril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that is commonly used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension), congestive heart failure, and various types of kidney diseases in dogs and cats.\u00a0 Benazepril can be given alone but is more often used in conjunction with other medications to treat congestive heart failure, especially when caused by degenerative mitral valve disease and dilated cardiomyopathy in dogs. In horses, it may be used as an additional medication for the treatment of heart valve disease. Benazepril can also be used to treat pets with kidney disease or proteinurea, which is a condition where proteins leak into their urine. \u00a0 How Benazepril Works Benazepril, an ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitor, minimizes burdens on the heart by lowering blood pressure and widening the blood vessels. By blocking ACE, a naturally occurring protein the body makes to constrict blood vessels, blood vessels stay relaxed, which decreases blood pressure. In pets with kidney disease, benazepril also relaxes the kidney\u2019s blood vessels, which decreases blood pressure in the kidney and reduces protein leakage into the urine.\u00a0 Benazepril is FDA-approved for human use under the brand name Lotensin\u00ae and is currently not FDA-approved as a veterinary medication. However, it is readily utilized in the veterinary field, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs for use in animals under certain circumstances. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. In certain circumstances, your veterinarian may recommend a compounded formulation of benazepril. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here Benazepril Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Your veterinarian will determine the appropriate dose. This medication is typically given once to twice daily in dogs and cats and every twelve hours in horses. Do not stop or change the dosage of benazepril without first discussing this with your veterinarian. This medication can be given with or without a meal; giving it with a meal may decrease digestive upset. Treats that contain high levels of sodium (salt) should not be used to give this medication. Your pet should have access to water at all times while on this medication. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do If you forget to give a dose of Benazepril. Generally, they may advise you to give it when you remember. However, if it is almost time for your pet\u2019s next dose, your veterinarian may instruct you to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. In most cases, they may instruct you to not give extra or double doses. \u00a0 Benazepril Possible Side Effects Benazepril is generally well tolerated, but when side effects are seen, common side effects may include: Low blood pressure (hypotension) Weakness Loss of appetite Fatigue (lethargy) Vomiting Diarrhea Incoordination Changes in thirst and urination If you believe your animal may be experiencing any side effects, consult your veterinarian. Human Side Effects While this is a human prescription medication there are different dosages and side effects that can occur in humans. \u00a0If you accidentally ingest a pet medication, immediately seek medical attention or call the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222. \u00a0 If you accidentally ingest a pet medication, immediately seek medical attention or call the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222.
