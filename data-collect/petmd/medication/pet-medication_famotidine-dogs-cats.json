This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Famotidine? Famotidine\u00a0is an antacid commonly used to reduce the production of stomach acid, which helps prevent and treat\u00a0stomach ulcers in dogs, cats, cattle, and small mammals. It may also be used in combination with other medications to treat\u00a0stomach ulcers in horses.\u00a0 Famotidine is FDA-approved for human use as a generic medication and under the brand name Pepcid\u00ae and Zantac 360\u2122. It is important to note that the former Zantac (active ingredient ranitidine) has been withdrawn from commercial markets. Famotidine is currently not FDA-approved as a veterinary medication. However, it is readily utilized in the veterinary field and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs for use in animals in certain circumstances. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. In certain circumstances, your veterinarian may recommend a compounded formulation of famotidine. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about\u00a0compounded medications here. How Famotidine Works Famotidine is classified as an H2 blocker. By blocking H2 receptors located on the stomach lining, famotidine prevents histamine from binding to those receptors, which decreases the secretion of stomach acid. Reducing stomach acid helps prevent further injury to the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. Famotidine Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Famotidine is best given on an empty stomach, preferably before the first meal of the day. If your pet has stomach upset when given this medication on an empty stomach, it can be given with a treat or a small amount of food. Missed a Dose Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of famotidine. Generally, they may advise you to give it when you remember, or if it is almost time for your next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. In most cases, do not give extra or double doses. Famotidine Possible Side Effects Famotidine is usually well tolerated and side effects from this medication are rare. Side effects, when seen, may include: Lack of appetite Vomiting Diarrhea Human Side Effects While this is a human prescription medication, there are different dosages and side effects that can occur in humans. Do not consume a medication that was dispensed for your pet and do not give your pet medication that was dispensed for a human.\u00a0 If you accidentally ingest a pet medication, call your physician, seek medical attention, or call the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222. \u00a0 Monitoring No specific monitoring is required for this medication, but your veterinarian may recommend routine testing depending on your pet\u2019s individual needs, other medications they may be on, or the issue that initially caused your pet to be placed on this medication. Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) Your pet\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of famotidine Famotidine Overdose Information While famotidine has a wide margin of safety, overdoses are still possible and symptoms are dependent on the amount ingested. Moderate overdoses may cause vomiting, pale gums, drowsiness, restlessness, and a red tint to the ears and areas around the mouth. Large overdoses can cause low blood pressure, high heart rate, or collapse. If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian, seek emergency veterinary care, or contact an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply.
