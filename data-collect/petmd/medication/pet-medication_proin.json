This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Proin\u00ae? Proin\u00ae (phyenlpropanolamine) is an FDA approved and veterinarian prescribed medication used to treat urinary incontinence in dogs. Proin\u00ae is not effective in dogs with incontinence due to neurologic disease or malformations. It is also used in an extra-label capacity to treat urinary incontinence in cats. The term off-or extra- label use means that a medication can be used in a way or in a particular species that is not specified on the medication label. Off-or extra- label use of a medication can only be prescribed by a veterinarian who has direct and personal knowledge of your pet and when there are no other appropriate medications for a particular pet&#039;s circumstances. How Proin\u00ae Works Proin\u00ae is classified as a sympathomimetic amine, which is a medication that acts like certain naturally occurring chemicals in the body. Proin\u00ae treats urinary incontinence by stimulating the smooth muscles of the urethra, bladder neck, and urethral sphincter to increase tone and closing the neck of the bladder.
