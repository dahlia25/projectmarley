This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Kaopectate\u00ae? Kaopectate\u00ae is an over-the-counter (OTC) anti-diarrheal medication approved for use in humans to relieve upset stomach. The active ingredient in Kaopectate\u00ae is bismuth subsalicylate, which is not FDA-approved for use in animals. In specific circumstances, it is sometimes used in dogs, cats, horses, cattle, swine, and ferrets, but only under the direction and supervision of a veterinarian. There are many causes of diarrhea in dogs, as well as different causes of diarrhea in cats, and treatment will vary depending on the underlying cause. If your pet has diarrhea, speak with your veterinarian before giving any new medication to determine the best and safest option for your pet\u2019s condition. Never give your pet a human medication without speaking to your vet. Bismuth subsalicylate is an active ingredient in Kaopectate\u00ae, Pepto-Bismol\u00ae, Bismatrol, and Pink Bismuth. These human formulations are not FDA approved as veterinary medications. However, Kaopectate\u00ae is sometimes utilized in the veterinary field, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs for use in animals in certain circumstances. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. Your veterinarian will determine whether this medication is right for your pet. How Kaopectate\u00ae Works The active ingredient in Kaopectate\u00ae is bismuth subsalicylate, which works by protecting the lining of the stomach and reducing toxins and harmful bacteria from causing inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Bismuth subsalicylate separates into two parts in the body\u2014salicylate, which is the active ingredient in aspirin, and bismuth. Salicylate helps reduce discomfort and inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract while bismuth offers antibacterial properties.\u00a0 However, there are potential harmful effects of aspirin in dogs and cats.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Kaopectate\u00ae Directions Follow the directions recommended provided by your veterinarian. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of Kaopectate\u00ae. Generally, they may instruct you to give it when you remember or, if it is almost time for the next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume the normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. Because this is a human medication, it requires a veterinarian\u2019s guidance for proper use. Kaopectate\u00ae Possible Side Effects Constipation\u00a0 Gray-black or green-black discoloration of the stool and the tongue Kaopectate\u00ae should not be given in cats without your veterinarian\u2019s strict supervision, as they are sensitive to products containing aspirin. Aspirin can even be toxic in cats.\u00a0 Kaopectate\u00ae breaks down into aspirin in the body. If your pet is sensitive or allergic to aspirin, has certain medical conditions, or is taking any medications that interact with aspirin, they may experience more severe side effects, including: Vomiting Bleeding Black tarry stool Weakness Abdominal pain Seizures Human Side Effects Kaopectate\u00ae is also an over-the-counter medication for humans, frequently with dosages different from those prescribed for your pet by a veterinarian. Due to possible\u00a0side effects, pets should not be given any medicine prescribed for humans.\u00a0\u00a0 Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) Your pet\u2019s or animal\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of Kaopectate\u00ae Kaopectate\u00ae Overdose Information An overdose of Kaopectate\u00ae can be life-threatening. Symptoms of an overdose may include diarrhea, lethargy, vomiting, wobbliness, weakness, panting, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, seizures, and kidney problems. If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian, seek emergency veterinary care, or call an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply.
