This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Diphenhydramine (Benadryl\u00ae)? Benadryl\u00ae is an antihistamine used to manage allergies in people. The active ingredient, diphenhydramine, is also commonly used to treat allergies in dogs, cats, horses, and other animals. It is available in a wide variety of products, ranging from oral to topical medications. Although Benadryl\u00ae is the branded version made for humans, Bendryl\u00ae is currently not FDA approved as a veterinary medication. However, the active ingredient, diphenhydramine is readily utilized in the veterinary field, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs in animals in certain circumstances. This is called extra-label, or sometimes off-label use, because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. There are also diphenhydramine products made specifically for animals, such as Vetadryl\u00ae. Diphenhydramine has been used for years in animals to manage allergic conditions such as hives, allergic reactions to insect bites and stings, and allergic skin disease. The affordable cost and relative safety of diphenhydramine allow it to be a commonly prescribed medication in animals with allergies, especially in combination with other treatments.\u00a0 Some pet parents give Benadryl\u00ae to calm anxious dogs during thunderstorms or fireworks. However, Benadryl\u00ae is not typically an effective treatment for anxiety. Talk to your veterinarian about your dog\u2019s behavior. More effective medications are available to treat anxiety and noise phobias in dogs.\u00a0\u00a0 In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of diphenhydramine. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the\u00a0 dosage strength\u00a0 is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. How Diphenhydramine (Benadryl\u00ae) Works  Diphenhydramine (Benadryl\u00ae) is an antihistamine that works by blocking histamine receptors. Histamine is a natural chemical that is released in a pet\u2019s body during an allergic reaction. The classic signs of allergies, such as itching, sneezing, swelling, and hives, are due in part to the action of histamine. Diphenhydramine does not block the release of histamines; instead, it blocks some of the body\u2019s ability to respond to it.\u00a0 Histamine can also trigger vomiting. By blocking histamine receptors, diphenhydramine may also help reduce vomiting triggered by motion sickness in dogs.\u00a0 Diphenhydramine (Benadryl\u00ae) Directions  Follow the directions provided by your veterinarian. Your veterinarian will prescribe a dosage\u00a0 based on your pet\u2019s weight. This dosing for animals will likely differ from human dosing recommendations found on the label of over-the-counter diphenhydramine.\u00a0\u00a0 Missed a Dose?\u00a0 If you forget a dose, give it when you remember and resume your dosing schedule. (For example, if you are giving diphenhydramine every 12 hours, give the missed dose then wait 12 hours before giving the next dose.) If it is close to the time for the next treatment, you can skip the missed dose to resume your normal schedule. Do not give two doses at once or extra doses unless directed by your veterinarian.\u00a0 Diphenhydramine (Benadryl\u00ae) Possible Side Effects  According to the drug label Vetadryl\u00ae, side effects can include: Sedation\u00a0Decreased energy level (lethargy)\u00a0 Constipation\u00a0 Dry mouth\u00a0 Urinary retention\u00a0 Diarrhea\u00a0 Vomiting\u00a0 Decreased appetite\u00a0 Excitement, especially in cats Human Side Effects While this medication can also be used in humans, dosing for pets is often different and it may have different side effects.
