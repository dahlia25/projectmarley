This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. Bravecto\u00ae Overview Bravecto\u00ae is a medication used to treat and prevent flea and tick infestations. It is available in several formulations and strengths, including an oral form that is for dogs only and a topical form that can be used in dogs and cats. The active ingredient in Bravecto\u00ae is fluralaner. Bravecto\u00ae belongs to a newer class of flea and tick preventatives called isoxazolines. Fluralaner is ingested by fleas and ticks when they bite, and works by over-exciting their nervous system, causing paralysis and death. In dogs and cats, this medication works within the first few hours after administration to kill fleas present on your pet. By reducing fleas, Bravecto\u00ae can help minimize itching and signs of skin disease associated with flea allergy dermatitis in dogs and cats. Bravecto\u00ae is also used in an extra-label capacity to treat demodectic mange and sarcoptic mange in dogs and sarcoptic mange in cats. The term off-or extra-label use means that a medication can be used in a way, or in a particular species, that is not specified on the medication label. While veterinarians often prescribe medications for off-label uses, your veterinarian will determine whether Bravecto\u00ae is right for your dog or cat. This medication is dosed separately for dogs and cats and is given by weight, so it is important to use the correct species and sized medication for your pet. Using cat medications on dogs or using dog medications on cats can cause serious problems, including lack of efficacy or an overdose. \u00a0 Bravecto\u00ae is a prescription medication and is not available over-the-counter. Talk to your vet about whether Bravecto\u00ae is right for your pet. Always read and follow all label instructions carefully and use Bravecto\u00ae only as advised by your vet.

Bravecto\u00ae 1-Month has the same flea and tick coverage as Bravecto\u00ae. Your veterinarian may switch your puppy from Bravecto\u00ae 1-Month to Bravecto\u00ae once they reach 6 months of age. Bravecto\u00ae 1-Month works best when given with a meal, not on an empty stomach.
