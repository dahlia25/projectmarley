Methimazole is a prescription anti-thyroid medication used for the management of hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism is a condition that occurs when there is excess thyroid hormone in a pet\u2019s system. Thyroid hormone helps regulate your pet\u2019s metabolism. Symptoms of hyperthyroidism can include weight loss, increased vocalization, vomiting, or increased drinking and urination.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Methimazole is rarely prescribed for dogs, as they are rarely diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. Instead, it is typically prescribed to cats, especially senior cats, which are more commonly diagnosed with this disease.\u00a0\u00a0 Methimazole is available under the brand names of Tapazole\u00ae and Felimazole\u00ae.\u00a0\u00a0 How Methimazole Works  Methimazole prevents the formation of thyroid hormone by restricting the body\u2019s use of iodine, which is used to produce thyroid hormone. Methimazole is not a cure for hyperthyroidism; it is given on a strict schedule to prevent the formation of excessive thyroid hormone. Your pet will need to be given this medication consistently for the prevention of symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism.\u00a0 In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of a medication. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug.\u202fCompounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs.\u202fYou can learn more about\u202fcompounded medications here.\u00a0 Methimazole Directions  Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Dosing is highly dependent on an individual cat\u2019s needs.\u00a0 Missed a Dose?\u00a0 If you forget to give a dose of methimazole, give it when you remember. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses.\u00a0\u00a0 Possible Side Effects of Methimazole Side effects from methimazole for hyperthyroidism typically occur within the first 3 months of use. Methimazole should be used with caution and/or with extra monitoring in cats with liver disease, autoimmune diseases, kidney disease, or other blood abnormalities. Methimazole should not be used in pets that are allergic to methimazole, or pets allergic to carbimazole or polyethylene glycol.\u00a0 The most common side effects are:\u00a0 Not eating (anorexia)\u00a0\u00a0 Vomiting\u00a0 Diarrhea\u00a0\u00a0 Depression\u00a0 Mild to moderate changes in your pet\u2019s white blood cell count, which typically self resolves\u00a0\u00a0 Rare side effects can include:\u00a0 Severe facial itching\u00a0\u00a0 A decrease in blood platelet levels\u00a0 Liver disease\u00a0 Immune-mediated disorders\u00a0 Lowered levels of thyroid hormone in the body can also uncover underlying kidney disease if present\u00a0 Human Side Effects\u00a0 Methimazole can affect the human thyroid as well. It\u2019s recommended that pet parents wear gloves during administration of the medication and wash their hands with soap and water afterwards to minimize any potential exposure to the drug. Pet parents who are pregnant or nursing should wear gloves when handling this medication or when exposed to the bodily fluid of cats on methimazole.\u00a0 Monitoring\u00a0 Cats being treated with methimazole for hyperthyroidism should have their thyroid levels and overall blood work checked before starting treatment. Once treatment has started, a pet\u2019s thyroid levels should be monitored after 3 weeks, and again after 6 weeks of treatment. Once appropriate testing levels are met, thyroid levels should be monitored every 3 months, and doses can be adjusted as needed. Additional testing may be recommended by your veterinarian.\u00a0\u00a0 Call Your Vet If:\u00a0 Severe side effects are seen (see above)\u00a0 You see or suspect an overdose\u00a0 You have additional questions or concerns about the use of methimazole\u00a0 Methimazole Overdose Information  One-time overdoses may cause the adverse reactions that are listed above. White blood cell changes, liver disease, low platelet levels and other serious side effects can also be seen. If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian or an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply.\u00a0 Pet Poison Helpline (855) 764-7661\u00a0 ASPCA Animal Poison Control (888) 426-4435\u00a0 Methimazole Storage  Methimazole should be stored at controlled room temperatures between 68-77\u00b0F. Brief exposure to temperatures 59\u00b0-86\u00b0F are acceptable. Keep the container tightly closed in order to protect from moisture and light.\u00a0\u00a0 Compounded medications should be stored according to the compounding pharmacy\u2019s label.\u00a0 Keep out of reach of children and pets.\u00a0"}]
