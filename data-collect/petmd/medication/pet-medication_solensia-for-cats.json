This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Solensia\u2122? Solensia\u2122 is the first and only FDA-approved treatment for the control of pain associated with osteoarthritis in cats. Approved by the FDA in January 2022, it is an injection given to your cat once a month by your veterinarian. How Solensia\u2122 Works Frunevetmab is the active ingredient in Solensia\u2122. It is classified as a monoclonal antibody, which is a lab-made protein developed to target certain parts of the body. Frunevetmab is specifically designed to work in cats and is the first monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA for veterinary use. In cats with osteoarthritis, cartilage breaks down in the joints, which causes the bones to rub together and cause pain. Frunevetmab specifically binds to a protein messenger called nerve growth factor (NGF) ,which blocks its ability to communicate pain signals to the brain, thereby preventing the cat from feeling pain. Solensia\u2122 Directions Solensia\u2122 is available only by prescription and must be administered at a veterinary practice. It is not available for administration at home because your vet\u2019s professional expertise is needed to properly diagnose pain associated with osteoarthritis in your cat, administer the injection, and monitor the safe use of Solensia\u2122. Solensia\u2122 is given as an under-the-skin (subcutaneous) injection once a month, and the dosage is determined by your cat\u2019s weight. Missed a Dose? If you forget to bring your cat in for their monthly injection, please contact your veterinarian. In general, your vet will schedule an appointment for your cat every four weeks to administer the injection and observe your cat\u2019s response to Solensia\u2122.\u00a0 Solensia\u2122 Possible Side Effects Solensia\u2122 may cause the following side effects: Vomiting Diarrhea Pain at the injection site Scabs on the head and neck Itchy skin Solensia\u2122 should not be administered to cats with known hypersensitivity to frunevetmab. It should also not be used in breeding, pregnant, or lactating cats because it may pass through the placental blood barrier and be excreted in milk. Human Side Effects Solensia\u2122 is not an approved medication for humans and accidental injection may cause harm. Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or trying to conceive should take extreme care to avoid accidental self-injection. Allow veterinary staff to hold and position your cat upon administration by your veterinarian. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, could potentially occur in the case of accidental self-injection. If accidental self-injection occurs, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician. Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) Your pet\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of Solensia\u2122 Solensia\u2122 Overdose Information Solensia\u2122 is well tolerated in cats, but an overdose is possible. Symptoms of an overdose include gastrointestinal issues (vomiting, diarrhea) or skin issues (scabs, itching, and hair loss). If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian, seek emergency veterinary care, or call an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply.
