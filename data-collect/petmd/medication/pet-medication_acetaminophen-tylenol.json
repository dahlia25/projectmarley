Acetaminophen (Tylenol\u00ae) is a human medication that is very rarely used in dogs and horses as an oral pain and fever reducing medication. Tylenol\u00ae is typically not prescribed because\u00a0\u00a0acetaminophen can have severe side effects\u00a0in pets, including liver damage and red blood cell toxicity. If a veterinarian prescribes acetaminophen to a dog, it is typically being prescribed in addition to other medications such as codeine or\u00a0tramadol as a part of a multidrug pain plan. Acetaminophen is currently being investigated as a treatment option for horses with laminitis because acetaminophen does not appear to have significant side effects in horses. Never give your horse acetaminophen without the guidance and direction of your veterinarian. Tylenol\u00ae is highly toxic to cats and should never be given to cats or left in a place where it is accessible to cats. How Acetaminophen (Tylenol\u00ae) Works The exact way acetaminophen works to reduce fever and offer pain relief is not entirely clear, but it is theorized that it increases the amount of serotonin and norepinephrine in the body by targeting certain neurotransmitter pathways of the central nervous system. Acetaminophen also affects the COX pathway of the central nervous system, which lowers the production of natural chemicals that trigger inflammation. Acetaminophen is FDA-approved for human use under many brand names, including Tylenol\u00ae, Aminofen\u00ae, Panadol\u00ae, and the generic acetaminophen. Acetaminophen is currently not FDA-approved as a veterinary medication. However, it is readily utilized in the veterinary field, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs in animals in certain circumstances. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. Your veterinarian will determine whether this medication is right for your pet. Acetaminophen (Tylenol\u00ae) Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian.
