The following content may contain Chewy links. PetMD is operated by Chewy\u00a0 Adequan\u00ae is an injectable medication prescribed for pets with arthritis. It treats cartilage loss in joints and may also help restore joint lubrication, relieve inflammation, and rebuild healthy cartilage. Adequan\u00ae works best when used proactively to prevent arthritis from worsening.\u00a0\u00a0 The use of Adequan\u00ae as a urinary bladder lining protector in cats with idiopathic cystitis is currently being prescribed extra-label or off-label by some veterinarians. This is called extra-label, or sometimes off-label use, because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label.\u00a0 How Adequan\u00ae Works  The active ingredient in Adequan\u00ae is called polysulfated glycosaminoglycan or PSGAG. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are naturally produced by the body and are critical components in the growth of cartilage. Like the GAGs already present in your pet\u2019s cartilage, Adequan\u00ae can help fortify the cartilage and maintain joint health in three main ways:\u00a0 Adequan\u00ae binds to other GAGs in the joint cartilage to help prevent them from continuing to degrade. This prevents arthritis from worsening.\u00a0\u00a0 Adequan\u00ae blocks the release of enzymes that can degrade the cartilage in the joint. Adequan\u00ae can also block some of the naturally occurring chemicals that cause inflammation in the joint.\u00a0 Adequan\u00ae stimulates the activity of existing collagen in the joint and improves the quality of joint fluid.\u00a0 GAGs are also located in other parts of the body such as the lining of the urinary bladder. It is theorized that Adequan\u00ae can help to strengthen the bladder wall and decrease inflammation in a cat with idiopathic cystitis.\u00a0\u00a0 Adequan\u00ae Directions   Be sure to discuss how to properly inject Adequan\u00ae before starting the medication by reading the drug label and consulting with your veterinarian.\u00a0\u00a0 Adequan\u00ae is an injectable medication that is approved for injection into the muscle. Adequan\u00ae is usually given twice weekly for up to 4 weeks, or according to your veterinarian\u2019s recommendations.\u00a0 When drawing up each dose from the vial, try to keep the vial and the syringe/needle as clean as possible to lower the risk of infection at the injection site. Clean and disinfect the stopper of the Adequan\u00ae vial before each use. Use only sterile needles and properly discard the needle after each use. Needles should only be used once.\u00a0\u00a0 Adequan\u00ae Dosing   Missed a Dose?\u00a0 If you forget to give a dose of Adequan\u00ae, give it when you remember. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses.\u00a0\u00a0 Possible Side Effects of Adequan\u00ae  Side effects are rare but possible. In clinical trials, side effects studied were generally mild and all pets were able to continue with their treatment.\u00a0\u00a0 Important side effects to note include: Pain, swelling, or hematoma (a blood blister or deep bruise) at the injection site that may be due to an infection\u00a0 Decreased blood clotting that may cause nose bleeds, gastrointestinal bleeding (can cause bloody, dark coffee ground stool), or vomiting\u00a0 If these symptoms occur, please contact your veterinarian immediately.\u00a0 Human Side Effects\u00a0 If you accidentally ingest or inject yourself with this medication, call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222.\u00a0 Monitoring\u00a0 No specific monitoring is required for this medication, but your veterinarian may recommend routine testing depending on your pet&#039;s individual needs.\u00a0 Call Your Vet If:\u00a0 Severe side effects are seen (see above)\u00a0 You see or suspect an overdose\u00a0 You have additional questions or concerns about the use of Adequan\u00ae\u00a0 Adequan\u00ae Overdose Information  Pain, swelling, or hematoma formation at the site of injection is possible with an overdose of Adequan\u00ae. An overdose can also cause low platelet counts which would increase blood clotting time. This may present as nose bleeds, gastrointestinal bleeding (which can cause bloody stool, dark coffee ground stool), or vomiting. Liver and kidney damage are also possible side effects of an overdose.\u00a0\u00a0 If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian or an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply.\u00a0 Pet Poison Helpline (855) 764-7661\u00a0 ASPCA Animal Poison Control (888) 426-4435\u00a0 Adequan\u00ae Storage  Adequan\u00ae should be stored at controlled room temperatures between 68-77\u00b0F.
