This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Nexgard\u00ae? Nexgard\u00ae\u00a0is an oral chewable tablet used in the treatment and prevention of fleas and certain ticks in dogs. For tick prevention, Nexgard\u00ae is indicated for the treatment and control of the American dog tick, black-legged tick, lone star tick, and brown dog tick. Nexgard\u00ae is also used in an extra-label capacity to treat demodectic mange, sarcoptic mange, and ear mites in dogs. It has also been used extra-label in cats for the treatment of ear mites and fleas, pigs for the treatment of scabies, and birds for the treatment of bird lice. The term extra-label or off-label use means that a medication can be used in a way or in a particular species that is not specified on the medication label. While veterinarians often prescribe medications for extra-label uses, your veterinarian will determine whether this medication is right for your dog. How Nexgard\u00ae Works The active ingredient in Nexgard\u00ae is afoxolaner, which belongs to a newer class of flea and tick preventatives called isoxazolines. Isoxazolines eliminate fleas and ticks by over-exciting their nervous system, causing paralysis and death. Nexgard\u00ae works within the first few hours after administration to kill fleas present on your pet. It is dosed for dogs by weight, so it is important to use the correct-sized medication for your pet. Weighing your dog regularly will ensure that you are using the correct product size. Nexgard\u00ae Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. This medication is given once a month by mouth in dogs weighing 4 pounds or more and 8 weeks of age or older. You can give Nexgard\u00ae with or without food. If your dog vomits this medication within two hours of giving it, redose with another full chew. Missed a Dose? If you forget to give a dose of Nexgard\u00ae, give it when you remember and resume a monthly dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. If it has been a long period of time since the last dose was given, you may see fleas temporarily during the missed time.
