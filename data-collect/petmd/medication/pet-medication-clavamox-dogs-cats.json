This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Clavamox\u00ae? Clavamox\u00ae is an antibiotic combination of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid that is commonly used in dogs and cats to treat susceptible infections, which may include urinary, respiratory, or skin infections. In dogs, Clavamox\u00ae is also used in the treatment of canine periodontal disease. Clavamox\u00ae is also used in the treatment of susceptible infections in birds and ferrets. The use of Clavamox\u00ae in these species is considered off-label. The term off- or extra-label use means that a medication can be used in a way or in a particular species that are not specified on the medication label. Veterinarians can legally prescribe medication for off-label use in certain circumstances. Your veterinarian will determine whether this medication is right for your pet. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is also a\u00a0prescription medication used for humans, frequently with dosages and side effects different from those prescribed for your pet by a veterinarian. Due to possible\u00a0side effects, pets should not be given any medicine prescribed for humans. How Clavamox\u00ae Works Clavamox\u00ae is an antibiotic that contains two ingredients: amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. Amoxicillin is classified as a penicillin antibiotic. Antibiotics in this class prevent susceptible bacteria from creating a key part of cell walls, which then weaken, causing the bacteria to die. Amoxicillin is often used to treat urinary tract infections, since it often concentrates in the kidney and urine. Clavulanic acid prevents certain bacteria from releasing an enzyme that breaks down amoxicillin and renders it ineffective. With the addition of clavulanic acid, amoxicillin can treat a wider spectrum of bacteria compared to treatment with amoxicillin alone. Clavamox\u00ae Directions Follow the directions on the drug label for Clavamox\u00ae Liquid or Clavamox\u00ae Chewable tablets or as provided by your veterinarian. Clavamox\u00ae can be given with or without food, but giving it with a meal can help to prevent any digestive upset that may occur when using this medication.\u00a0\u00a0 Liquid versions of Clavamox\u00ae are usually supplied as a powder. Follow the mixing directions closely and note the exact amount of water that should be mixed with the powder to create the suspension. Mixed medication must be stored in the refrigerator. Any unused portion of the suspension should be discarded after 10 days.\u00a0 Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of Clavamox\u00ae. Generally, they may instruct you to give it when you remember. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, they may instruct you to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. Clavamox\u00ae Possible Side Effects Like all other antibiotics, Clavamox\u00ae may cause stomach upset along with these other side effects:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Vomiting\u00a0 Diarrhea\u00a0 Lack of appetite\u00a0 Penicillin allergies in animals are rare, but they can happen. Clavamox\u00ae contains amoxicillin, which is closely related to penicillin. This medication should not be used in pets who have a history of allergic reaction to penicillin or cephalosporins. Signs of an allergic reaction may include: Skin rashes (especially in the ears)\u00a0 Watery eyes\u00a0 Hives (urticaria)\u00a0 Facial swelling\u00a0 Vomiting\u00a0 Diarrhea\u00a0 Fever\u00a0 Anaphylaxis\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Clavamox\u00ae should not be used in rabbits or other herbivores, as life-threatening diarrhea can occur in these animals. Human Side Effects While this is a human prescription medication, there are different dosages and different side effects that can occur in humans. If you accidentally ingest a medication prescription for your pet, call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222.\u00a0 If you are allergic to penicillin, talk to your veterinarian about using another medication or ensure that you wear gloves while handling this medication. Monitoring\u00a0 A culture should be obtained prior to treatment to determine whether the bacteria is susceptible to Clavamox.\u00ae Otherwise, no specific monitoring is required for this medication, but your veterinarian may recommend routine testing depending on your pet\u2019s individual needs, other medications they may be on, or the issue that initially caused your pet to be placed on this medication.\u00a0 Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) Your pet\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of Clavamox\u00ae Clavamox\u00ae Overdose Information An overdose of Clavamox\u00ae is unlikely to cause toxicity but it may cause vomiting, diarrhea, and lack of appetite. Large overdoses may cause kidney disease, loss of coordination, or seizures.\u00a0 If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian, seek emergency veterinary care, or call an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply.
