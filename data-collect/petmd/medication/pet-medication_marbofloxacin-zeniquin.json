This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Marbofloxacin? Marbofloxacin (generic for Zeniquin\u00ae) is an FDA-approved antibiotic medication approved for use in dogs and cats that treats a wide variety of bacterial infections\u2014especially those in the bladder, kidneys, prostate, or skin. How Marbofloxacin Works Marbofloxacin works by disrupting DNA formation in susceptible bacteria during the replication process, thereby preventing the bacteria from growing and multiplying. Marbofloxacin is approved for use in dogs and cats. However, it is readily utilized in the veterinary field across many different species including rabbits, reptiles, and birds. Veterinarians can legally prescribe certain medications for animals they are not approved for in certain circumstances. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. Marbofloxacin is not recommended for use in growing animals or pregnant animals. Marbofloxacin and other antibiotics that belong to the fluoroquinolone class can cause abnormal cartilage development in growing animals. This medication should not be used in pets that are hypersensitive to quinolones. It is also illegal to use this medication in food-producing animals in the United States. Speak with your veterinarian before providing this medication to a pet with known or suspected central nervous system disorders. In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of marbofloxacin. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs.

Generally, they may recommend that you give it when you remember, or, if it is almost time for your next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. Marbofloxacin Possible Side Effects Marbofloxacin can cause upset stomach.
