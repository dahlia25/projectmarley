This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Budesonide? Budesonide is an oral corticosteroid used in dogs and cats to treat chronic (long-term) inflammation of the intestines. It may be used to manage inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in dogs and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in cats. It may also be used in pets who cannot tolerate other corticosteroid medications since it may generally cause fewer overall side effects compared to other corticosteroids. Budesonide is FDA-approved for human use under the brand names Ortikos\u00ae, Tarpeyo\u00ae, Entocort EC\u00ae, Rhinocort\u00ae, and Uceris\u00ae and the generic budesonide. Budesonide is currently not FDA-approved as a veterinary medication. However, it is occasionally utilized in the veterinary field, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs in animals in certain circumstances. This practice is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. Your veterinarian will determine whether this medication is right for your pet. Budesonide is also a prescription medication for humans, frequently with dosages and side effects different from those prescribed for your pet by a veterinarian. Due to possible side effects, pets should not be given any medicine prescribed for humans. In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of budesonide. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. How Budesonide Works Oral budesonide is a corticosteroid formulated to delay dissolving in the body until it reaches the gastrointestinal tract, where it works locally to block the harmful effects of gastrointestinal inflammation. Since less of the medication is absorbed through the bloodstream compared to other corticosteroids, this may result in fewer corticosteroid-associated side effects in the body. Budesonide Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or per instructions provided by your veterinarian. Budesonide can be given with or without food, but giving it with food can decrease the risk of digestive upset. Generally, your veterinarian will recommend providing your pet with plenty of water while they are on budesonide. Giving budesonide with certain medications can result in health risks to your pet, so it is important to discuss your pet\u2019s medications and medical conditions with your veterinarian prior to administering this medication to your pet. If your veterinarian recommends that you discontinue this medication for any reason, they will typically recommend that you wean your pet off the medication slowly, and under their supervision, especially if your pet has been taking budesonide long-term. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of budesonide.\u00a0 Generally, they may instruct you to give it when you remember, or if it is almost time for your pet\u2019s next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. Budesonide Possible Side Effects Like all other medications, budesonide may cause side effects. Common side effects include: Vomiting Loss of appetite Diarrhea Black, tarry stools Weakened immune system (more prone to infections) Increased panting (in dogs) Increased thirst Increased urination Increased appetite Muscle weakness Pot-bellied appearance to abdomen Weight gain Note, this medication has a moderate duration. Therefore, side effects may last for several days, even after you have stopped administering the medication to your pets. Side effects may last for a longer amount of time in animals with liver or kidney disease. Budesonide should be avoided in pregnant and lactating pets. \u00a0 Human Side Effects While this is a human prescription medication, there are different dosages and side effects that can occur in humans. If you accidentally ingest a pet medication, call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222. Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) You see or suspect an overdose Your pet\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment. You have additional questions or concerns about the use of budesonide Budesonide Overdose Information Overdoses of budesonide can cause severe gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloody vomit (fresh blood or digested blood that may look like coffee grounds), loss of appetite, black tarry stools, or other symptoms such as high fever and low energy level. If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian, seek emergency veterinary care, or call an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply.
