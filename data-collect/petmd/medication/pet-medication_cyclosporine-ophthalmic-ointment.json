This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Optimmune\u00ae? Optimmune\u00ae (0.2% Cyclosporine, USP) is FDA approved for ophthalmic use in dogs. It is an immune system modulating eye ointment used to treat dry eye (keratoconjunctivitis sicca, or KCS) and pannus (chronic superficial keratitis, or CSK) in dogs. Veterinarians may also prescribe Optimmune\u00ae (0.2% Cyclosporine, USP) to treat other inflammatory diseases of the cornea. Dry eye and pannus are both chronic conditions that typically require consistent, life-long care. Optimmune\u00ae (0.2% Cyclosporine, USP) is prescribed for these conditions to increase tear production and improve the signs of disease, but it is not a cure. \u00a0 How Optimmune\u00ae Works? The active ingredient of Optimmune\u00ae is cyclosporine. Cyclosporine inhibits T cells, a type of white blood cell involved in the immune response. By inhibiting T cells, cyclosporine helps regulate the immune system in dogs with dry eye or pannus. This decreases inflammation on the surface of the eye. Cyclosporine also appears to stimulate the lacrimal gland, which helps produce tears. Decreasing inflammation and increasing tear production can significantly improve the signs of dry eye and pannus in dogs. Optimmune\u00ae Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Optimmune is commonly applied every 12 hours. It is important that the medication\u2019s applicator tip does not contact your pet\u2019s eye during application to avoid contaminating the medication. If you are using any other eye drops, it is typically recommended to wait 5-10 minutes before instilling any other medications into the eye. Do not stop using Optimmune\u00ae without first talking to your veterinarian. Missed a Dose If you forget to give a dose of Optimmune\u00ae (0.2% Cyclosporine, USP), give it when you remember. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. Optimmune\u00ae Possible Side Effects If your dog develops any new or worsening symptoms during treatment with Optimmune\u00ae, please consult your veterinarian.

Side effects may include: Redness of the eyesWatery eyesEye discomfort - rubbing or \u201cpawing\u201d at the face or eyesEyelid squinting or excessive blinkingRedness or swelling of the eyelidsHair loss around the eyesHuman Side Effects This medication is also used in human medicine, but with different dosages and side effects.
