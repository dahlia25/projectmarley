This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Tresaderm\u00ae? Tresaderm\u00ae\u00a0is a veterinarian-prescribed topical solution used to treat specific skin and ear infections in dogs and cats. Tresaderm contains three active ingredients: neomycin sulfate, dexamethasone, and thiabendazole. This medication is prescribed for the treatment of external ear or skin infections in dogs and cats that are caused by susceptible strains of fungus and bacteria. Tresaderm\u00ae is only FDA-approved in dogs and cats but is often used in ferrets for the off-label treatment of ear mites. The term off- or extra-label use means that a medication can be used in a way or in a particular species that is not specified on the medication label. Off- or extra-label use of a medication can only be prescribed by a veterinarian who has direct and personal knowledge of your pet and\u00a0when there are no other appropriate medications for a particular pet&#039;s circumstances. How Tresaderm\u00ae Works Tresaderm\u00ae works with three separate components to treat susceptible ear infections: Neomycin is an antibacterial agent active against several common bacteria which infect the ear and skin. Thiabendazole is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent used to treat common yeast and fungal organisms. Dexamethasone is a steroid utilized to decrease inflammation in the ear canal or the skin. Before using this product in the ear, it is important that your veterinarian examines your pet&#039;s eardrum to ensure it is intact to avoid damage to the inner ear. Tresaderm\u00ae Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Ensure that the external ear canal or skin area being treated is thoroughly cleaned and dried before treatment. The amount and frequency of administration will depend on what area is being treated, the severity of the infection and the size of the pet. Use with caution around the eyes and wash hands after administering. Application should be limited to a period of not longer than one week. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian ff you forget to administer a dose of Tresaderm\u00ae. Generally, they will advise you to apply it when you remember. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, your veterinarian may recommend you skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. In most cases, they may instruct you to not apply extra or double doses. \u00a0 Tresaderm\u00ae Possible Side Effects Topical irritation at the application site is the most common side effect, and it may include: Redness Irritation Discomfort An allergy to neomycin has been seen rarely in dogs and would cause the symptoms above.
