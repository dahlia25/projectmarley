This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Fluoxetine? Fluoxetine is the active ingredient in the human medications Prozac\u00ae, Rapiflux\u00ae, Sarafem\u00ae and Selfemra\u00ae and the canine medication Reconcile\u00ae. Fluoxetine is used in animals as a behavior-modifying medication and is commonly prescribed to treat separation anxiety in dogs. It is important to note that all behavior-modifying medications are typically best utilized in combination with a behavior modification plan. This can be achieved in partnership with a veterinarian or certified trainer. How Fluoxetine Works Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Serotonin is a neurotransmitter, a chemical in the brain that sends messages throughout the nervous system. Serotonin is responsible for moderating mood and behavior, and low levels are thought to contribute to stress and anxiety. SSRIs such as fluoxetine block serotonin from being absorbed back into the nervous system. This increases the amount of serotonin between the nerves and helps the brain regulate mood and behavior. Fluoxetine HCL (chewable tablets) (brand name Reconcile\u00ae) is FDA approved for use in dogs to treat separation anxiety, in conjunction with behavioral modification, but Reconcile\u00ae and generic fluoxetine are also commonly prescribed off-label to treat other behavioral disorders such as anxiety and obsessive-compulsive behaviors in dogs. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. Fluoxetine is also prescribed off-label in cats for inappropriate urination and separation anxiety.\u00a0 Fluoxetine is readily utilized in the veterinary field, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs, like fluoxetine, in animals in certain circumstances. Your veterinarian will determine which dose and route of administration is right for your pet. Never give your pet a human medication unless prescribed by your veterinarian. Tell your veterinarian if your pet has a history of epilepsy or seizures, or if your pet is also taking other medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., phenothiazines such as acepromazine or chlorpromazine), as fluoxetine may increase your pet\u2019s risk of seizures. Your veterinarian will also determine whether there are any other contraindications.\u00a0 Fluoxetine Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian.\u00a0 Your veterinarian may give instructions to administer this medication by mouth once or twice daily, with once daily being most common. It can take up to 4-8 weeks for full effect to be observed. If your veterinarian decides to take your pet off this medication, follow their directions carefully on how to appropriately discontinue fluoxetine.\u00a0 Missed a Dose?Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of fluoxetine. Generally, they may advise you to give the dose when you remember. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, your veterinarian may instruct you to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. In most cases, your veterinarian may instruct you to not give extra or double doses.\u00a0 Human Side EffectsWhile this is a human medication, there are different dosages and side effects that can occur in humans. \u00a0If you accidentally ingest this medication, or if skin or eye irritation occurs, immediately seek medical attention or call \u00a0the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222. MonitoringTypically, beyond monitoring your pet\u2019s response to fluoxetine, no specific monitoring is required for this medication. However, your veterinarian may recommend routine testing depending on your pets&#039; individual needs, other medications they may be on and/or the issue that initially caused your pet to be placed on this medication. If there is no improvement in your pets&#039; symptoms after 8 weeks on this medication your veterinarian may suggest additional or alternative treatment options.
