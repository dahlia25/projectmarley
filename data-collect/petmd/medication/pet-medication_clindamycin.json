This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Clindamycin? Clindamycin is an antibiotic medication used in dogs and cats to treat skin infections, wounds, abscesses, respiratory infections, and oral infections related to dental disease. Clindamycin is also used off-label for the treatment of susceptible infections in other species such as birds, ferrets, and reptiles. It is important to note that clindamycin should not be given to species including horses, cows, sheep, goats, and other small mammals, as clindamycin can cause fatal diarrhea in these species. Clindamycin is also used off-label to treat certain protozoal infections in dogs and cats such as babesiosis, hepatozoonosis, neosporosis. and toxoplasmosis. The term off- or extra-label use means that a medication is prescribed for a certain use, or in a particular species, that is not specified on the medication label. Veterinarians can legally prescribe medications for off-label use in certain circumstances. Your veterinarian will determine whether this medication is right for your pet. How Clindamycin Works Clindamycin is an antibiotic that is subclassified as a lincosamide. Lincosamide antibiotics such as clindamycin block the formation of crucial proteins in certain strains of susceptible bacteria, which prevents the bacteria from multiplying and growing. Depending on the concentration of clindamycin, location of the infection, and strain of the bacteria, clindamycin may also cause bacterial death. In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of clindamycin. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs.
