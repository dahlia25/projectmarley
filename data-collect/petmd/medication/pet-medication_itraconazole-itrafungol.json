This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Itraconazole? Itraconazole is an oral antifungal medication prescribed by veterinarians for the treatment of fungal infections in cats. Itraconazole is also available under the brand name Itrafungol\u2122.\u00a0Itraconazole can also be used off-label in several other species, including dogs, horses, birds, small mammals, and reptiles. The term off- or extra-label use means that a medication is prescribed for a certain use, or in a particular species that is not specified on the medication label. Veterinarians can legally prescribe medications for off-label use under certain circumstances. Your veterinarian will determine whether this medication is right for your pet. How Itraconazole Works Itraconazole works as an antifungal medication by stopping the fungi from creating an enzyme needed to produce their cell membrane. This inhibits the metabolism and growth of a given fungus. Itraconazole Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Itraconazole capsules are best given with food; foods that are higher in fat help promote its absorption into the body. Itrafungol\u2122 oral solution is best given on an empty stomach. You should wash your hands and any exposed skin after administering the oral solution or handling your pet during treatment. Where protective gloves when handling your pet after treatment with the oral solution. If your pet is experiencing digestive upset after being given either version of this medication, please contact your veterinarian. Itraconazole may need to be given for days to weeks or months depending on the infectious agent and location of the infection. Missed a Dose?
