This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Prazosin? Prazosin has been commonly used in the treatment of urinary tract obstructions in cats, but recent studies have shown that it may not be as effective as once thought in the treatment of this condition. \u00a0 Prazosin may also be used as part of a multidrug treatment plan to help with several medical issues including high blood pressure in dogs and cats and congestive heart failure (CHF) in dogs. Prazosin is FDA-approved for human use under the brand name Minipress\u00ae and the generic prazosin. Prazosin is currently not FDA-approved as a veterinary medication. However, it is readily utilized in the veterinary field, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs in animals in certain circumstances. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. How Prazosin Works Prazosin belongs to a class of medications called alpha-1 adrenergic blockers. Prazosin blocks alpha-1 receptors located on the veins and arteries, causing them to relax and dilate (widen). This dilation creates more space within the veins and arteries for blood to flow, thereby lowering the body\u2019s overall blood pressure. In pets with urinary tract obstructions, prazosin relaxes the muscles of the urethra that may be spasming due to the obstruction. It can also dilate (widen) the urethral sphincter to allow for easier urination. In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of prazosin. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. Prazosin Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Prazosin can be given with or without food, but if your pet experiences an upset stomach after taking this medication on an empty stomach, try offering prazosin with a small meal or treat. Dosages for this medication vary depending on the species and the disease process being treated. This medication may be given once daily or up to three times daily. Follow your veterinarian\u2019s recommendations for your specific pet. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of prazosin. Generally, they may instruct you to give it when you remember or, if it is almost time for your next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. Prazosin Possible Side Effects Abnormally low blood pressure or faintingLethargy Weakness Dizziness Vomiting Diarrhea Constipation Elevated third eyelid Human Side Effects Prazosin is also a prescription medication for humans, frequently with dosages different from those prescribed for your pet by a veterinarian. Due to possible side effects, pets should not be given any medicine prescribed for humans. If you accidentally ingest a pet medication, call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222. \u00a0 Monitoring Specific monitoring or routine testing while your pet is on this medication may be recommended by your veterinarian depending on your pet\u2019s individual needs, other medications they may be on, and/or the issue that initially caused your pet to be placed on this medication. Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) Your pet\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of prazosin Prazosin Overdose Information Signs of an overdose of prazosin may include incoordination, dizziness, lethargy, low blood pressure, trembling, elevated heart rate, and loss of consciousness. If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian, seek emergency veterinary care, or contact an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply.
