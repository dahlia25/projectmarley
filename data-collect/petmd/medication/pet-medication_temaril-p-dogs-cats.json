This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Temaril-P\u00ae? Temaril-P\u00ae is an FDA-approved medication prescribed by veterinarians for itching and coughing in dogs, especially if triggered by environmental allergies and inflammation. Temaril-P\u00ae is a combination of 2 medications\u2014the antihistamine trimeprazine and the corticosteroid\u00a0 prednisolone. Temaril-P\u00ae does not cure allergies and inflammation, but it can help suppress related symptoms. Although uncommon, Temaril-P\u00ae is sometimes prescribed for the treatment of itching in cats. The use of Temaril-P\u00ae in cats is considered off-label. The term off- or extra-label use means that a medication can be used in a way or in a particular species that is not specified on the medication label. Veterinarians can legally prescribe medications for off-label use in certain circumstances. Your veterinarian will determine whether this medication is right for your pet. In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of Temaril-P\u00ae. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. How Temaril-P\u00ae Works Temaril-P\u00ae is a combination of trimeprazine, an antihistamine, and prednisolone, a corticosteroid. Trimeprazine blocks the effects of histamine, a chemical messenger produced with environmental allergies and inflammation, which occurs with an overreactive immune system. As an antihistamine, trimeprazine can help suppress coughing and itching. As a corticosteroid, prednisolone blocks harmful effects of inflammation through multiple complex pathways. Treatment with a trimeprazine/prednisolone combination may be more effective for itching than treatment with prednisolone alone. This reduces the dose of prednisolone needed to help control your pet\u2019s symptoms, which can help your pet experience fewer medication-related side effects. Temaril-P\u00ae Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Always provide your pet with plenty of water when they are taking Temaril-P\u00ae. Temaril-P\u00ae can be given with or without food, but giving it with food can decrease the risk of digestive upset. If your veterinarian recommends that you discontinue this medication for any reason, it is best to wean your pet off slowly, under a veterinarian&#039;s supervision, especially if they have been taking it long term. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of Temaril-P\u00ae. Generally, they may instruct you to give it when you remember, or, if it is almost time for your pet\u2019s next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses Temaril-P\u00ae Possible Side Effects Increased thirst Increased urination Increased appetite Vomiting Diarrhea Weakened immune system Grogginess Low body temperature Low blood pressure Muscle stiffness, tremors, weakness Weight loss Human Side Effects Temaril-P\u00ae is not approved for use in humans.
