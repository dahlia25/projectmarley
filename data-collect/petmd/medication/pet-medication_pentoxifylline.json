This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Pentoxifylline? Pentoxifylline is used to treat diseases that affect blood flow in the small blood vessels. In dogs, improving blood flow is an important part in treating inflammatory disease. It also aids in the healing of skin lesions such as ulcerative dermatosis, dermatomyositis, cutaneous lupus, pinnal vasculitis, and other diseases that occur due to inflammation in the small blood vessels (vasculitis). Pentoxifylline is also used, though less frequently, to treat vasculitis and certain skin conditions in cats. In horses, pentoxifylline is used to treat septicemia but may also be used for foot/hoof related issues like laminitis or navicular disease. It can also be used for inflammation of the placenta in mares (placentitis). How Pentoxifylline Works The way pentoxifylline works is not completely understood. Pentoxifylline seems to make new red blood cells more flexible and decreases the thickness of the blood. This allows the blood to flow more smoothly and gain better access to the body\u2019s very small blood vessels. In horses, pentoxifylline is also thought to decrease cytokines, which are chemical messengers of inflammation driven by the immune system. While pentoxifylline is FDA-approved for human use, it is currently not FDA-approved as a veterinary medication. However, it is readily utilized in the veterinary field, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs in animals in certain circumstances. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of pentoxifylline. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. Pentoxifylline Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. This medication should be given with food. The frequency of administration will depend on the animal\u2019s individual condition. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of pentoxifylline. Generally, they may instruct you to give it when you remember, or if it is almost time for your next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. In most cases, do not give extra or double doses. Pentoxifylline Possible Side Effects Side effects in dogs and cats are uncommon, but may include: Vomiting Diarrhea Loss of appetite Excitement or agitation In horses, pentoxifylline is generally well tolerated. Side effects may include: Muscle tremors Sweating Increased heart rate Human Side Effects While this is a human prescription medication, there are different dosages and side effects that can occur in humans. \u00a0If you accidentally ingest a pet medication, call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222. \u00a0 Monitoring Specific monitoring or routine testing while your pet is on this medication may be recommended by your veterinarian depending on your pet\u2019s individual needs, other medications they may be on, and/or the issue that initially caused your pet to be placed on this medication. Animals that are at an increased risk for bleeding may require additional monitoring. Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) Your pet\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of pentoxifylline Pentoxifylline Overdose Information Symptoms of an overdose of pentoxifylline include vomiting, loss of appetite, increased heart rate, bloody diarrhea, bleeding, drooling, high blood pressure, agitation, and tremors or seizures. Even small overdoses in dogs can cause symptoms. If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian, seek emergency veterinary care, or call an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply.
