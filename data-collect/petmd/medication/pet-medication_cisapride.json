This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Cisapride? Cisapride is an oral medication that helps move food through the digestive tract. It can be used in several animals (dogs, cats, small mammals, chickens, reptiles, and rabbits) to treat slowing of the digestive tract, reflux, and constipation. It can also be prescribed to help prevent reflux and aspiration pneumonia in dogs undergoing surgery. Rarely, some veterinarians may also recommend this medication for cats with megacolon. Cisapride was FDA-approved for human use under the brand name Propulsid\u00ae, but its approval was pulled in the US due to adverse effects seen in humans (heart rhythm abnormalities, which have not been seen in pets). Cisapride is currently not FDA-approved as a veterinary medication. However, it is still used, though infrequently, in the veterinary field, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain unapproved drugs for use in animals in certain circumstances. Only your veterinarian can determine whether cisapride is right for your pet, based on your pet\u2019s symptoms and circumstances. How Cisapride Works Cisapride promotes acetylcholine, a naturally occurring signaling compound, to be released near the nerves responsible for smooth muscle movement in the stomach and intestines. Acetylcholine prompts these muscles to contract and relax, thereby ushering the movement of food throughout the entire digestive system. In doing so, cisapride helps to relieve constipation, as well as symptoms of constipation such as bloating and nausea. Cisapride is not FDA-approved in humans or animals at this time and must be obtained from a compounding pharmacy. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. Cisapride Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Cisapride can be given with or without a meal. If digestive upset occurs, try giving cisapride with a meal. If digestive upset continues, please contact your veterinarian. Cisapride does not stay in the system long, so dosing is often done up to three or four times a day depending on the species and reason for using the medication. Your veterinarian will determine the best course of treatment for your pet. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian if you forget to give a dose of cisapride. Generally, your veterinarian may instruct you to give it when you remember or, if it is almost time for your pet\u2019s next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. Cisapride Possible Side Effects Cisapride is generally well tolerated in animals. Although cisapride was removed from the market for humans due to heart rate abnormalities, this has not been observed in dogs or cats.  Side effects are not common, but may include: Vomiting Diarrhea Stomach pain Human Side Effects This medication is no longer prescribed in human medicine. If you accidentally ingest a pet medication, call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222.\u00a0 Monitoring No specific monitoring is required for this medication, but your veterinarian may recommend routine testing depending on your pet\u2019s individual needs, other medications they may be on, and/or the issue that initially caused your pet to be placed on this medication. Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) Your pet\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of cisapride Cisapride Overdose Information Signs of a cisapride overdose may include lethargy, diarrhea, incoordination, tremors, abnormal behavior, fever and seizures. If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian, seek emergency veterinary care, or contact an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply.
