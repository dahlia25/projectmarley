This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Carprofen (Rimadyl\u00ae)?  Veterinarians commonly prescribe carprofen or\u00a0Rimadyl\u00ae\u00a0\u00a0to treat osteoarthritis (OA) and other causes of inflammation in dogs. Rimadyl\u00ae is in a class of medications called NSAIDs, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These medications work to reduce your dog\u2019s pain by reducing inflammation. Your veterinarian may also prescribe Rimadyl\u00ae after surgery to manage surgical pain.\u00a0 Rimadyl is used off label for pain relief and inflammation in other species, among them horses, cows, sheep, birds, rabbits, ferrets, other small mammals and reptiles. The term off- or extra- label use means that a medication can be used in a way or in a particular species that are not specified on the medication label. Off- or extra- label use of a medication can only be done by a veterinarian who has direct and personal knowledge of your pet and when there are no other appropriate medications for a particular pet&#039;s circumstance. In certain circumstances, your veterinarian may recommend a compounded formulation of carprofen. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about\u00a0compounded medications here. How Carprofen (Rimadyl\u00ae) Works  The active ingredient in Rimadyl\u00ae is carprofen. Carprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that provides pain relief, decreases inflammation, and reduces fever.\u00a0\u00a0 NSAIDs, in general, block the production of natural chemicals that trigger inflammation, something called a COX pathway. Some COX pathways are helpful in digestion, kidney health and clotting. In dogs, carprofen blocks significantly more of the chemicals that cause inflammation with fewer negative effects on the beneficial chemicals. Because of this, carprofen decreases inflammation and pain in dogs with fewer side effects than some other types of NSAIDs. This is not true of every species. In cats, carprofen blocks many of the beneficial pathways as well as those that trigger inflammation.\u00a0 Carprofen is also available as Caprieve\u00ae, Carprovet\u00ae, Novox\u00ae, OstiFen\u2122,\u00a0Quellin\u2122 , and Vetprofen\u00ae.\u00a0 Carprofen (Rimadyl\u00ae) Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Your veterinarian will prescribe a dosage and treatment plan based on your dog\u2019s weight and the cause of their pain.\u202f\u00a0 Most dogs willingly take Rimadyl\u00ae chewable tablets like a treat. If not, you can hide the tablet in a small amount of tasty food. Although Rimadyl\u00ae can be given with or without food, giving it with food can help reduce the chance of stomach upset.\u00a0\u00a0 Give Rimadyl\u00ae for as long as your veterinarian recommends. Many dogs, especially those with OA, require long-term treatment. Talk to your veterinarian if your dog still appears in pain or is reluctant to play, climb stairs, or jump. Additional pain medications may be necessary.\u00a0\u00a0 Missed a Dose?\u00a0 If you forget to give a dose of Rimadyl\u00ae, give it when you remember. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and resume the normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses.\u00a0\u00a0 Carprofen (Rimadyl\u00ae) Possible Side Effects  Although Rimadyl\u00ae is typically well-tolerated by dogs, serious side effects can occur. Contact your veterinarian if you see any of the following signs:\u00a0 Vomiting\u00a0 Diarrhea\u00a0 Decreased appetite\u00a0\u00a0 Decreased energy level (lethargy)\u00a0 Dark, black, or tar-like stools\u00a0 Increased thirst\u00a0 Increased urination or accidents inside the house\u00a0 Pale gum color (very light pink, white, or grey gums)\u00a0 Yellowing of the gums, skin, or whites of the eyes\u00a0 Incoordination or weakness\u00a0 Seizures\u00a0 Any behavioral changes\u00a0 Serious reactions can occur without warning. However, most dogs recover if the medication is stopped, and any necessary emergency veterinary care is promptly provided.\u00a0\u00a0 Human Side Effects While this medication can also be used in humans, it may be given differently and have different side effects. If you accidentally ingest this medication, call your physician or local poison control center. Monitoring Your veterinarian is likely to recommend routine testing while your pet is on this medication.

Call Your Vet If:\u00a0\u00a0 Side effects are seen (see above)\u00a0 You see or suspect an overdose,\u00a0 If your pet still appears to be in pain\u00a0 Call your vet or pharmacist if you have additional questions or concerns about the use of Rimadyl\u00ae.\u00a0 Carprofen (Rimadyl\u00ae) Overdose Information  By design, dogs are meant to like the taste of Rimadyl\u00ae chewable tablets.
