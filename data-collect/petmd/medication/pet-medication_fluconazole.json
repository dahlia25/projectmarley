This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Fluconazole? Fluconazole is an antifungal medication used to treat fungal and yeast infections in several species including: dogs, cats, horses, birds, small mammals, guinea pigs, rats, hamsters, ferrets, and reptiles. Fluconazole is often the first-choice medication for bodywide (systemic) fungal infections from organisms such as cryptococcus, Valley Fever (coccidioidomycosis), aspergillus, candidiasis, dermatophytosis (ringworm), histoplasmosis, and blastomycosis. Fluconazole may also be used for the treatment of yeast and ringworm infections of the skin, ears, and nails. Depending on the pet that is being treated and the type of infection, certain antifungals may work better than others, like itraconazole, ketoconazole, or topical preparations. Your veterinarian will determine the best medication based on your pet\u2019s needs and symptoms. Fluconazole is FDA-approved for human use under the brand name Diflucan\u00ae and the generic fluconazole. Fluconazole is currently not FDA-approved as a veterinary medication. However, it is readily utilized in the veterinary field, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs in animals in certain circumstances. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. How Fluconazole Works Fluconazole works as an antifungal medication by blocking the fungus\u2019 ability to create an enzyme needed to produce their cell membrane. This stops the metabolism and growth of a given fungus. Fluconazole is often used when fungal infections occur in the nervous system or urinary tract, due to its ability to penetrate those spaces. Fluconazole is available in tablet or liquid suspension form. Fluconazole is cleared primarily by renal excretion and should be administered with caution to pets with liver dysfunction. The dose of the medication may need to be reduced in pets with impaired renal function. Additionally, this medication should be used with caution in pets that are pregnant or nursing. Speak with your veterinarian about your pet\u2019s condition and whether this medication is right for your pet. In certain circumstances, your veterinarian may recommend a compounded formulation of fluconazole. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. Fluconazole Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Generally, fluconazole may be given with or without food. If your pet is experiencing digestive upset after being given this medication on an empty stomach, try giving it with a small meal. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of fluconazole. Generally, they may instruct you to give it when you remember or, if it is almost time for your pet\u2019s next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. Fluconazole Possible Side Effects Fluconazole is generally well tolerated in dogs and cats, but the following side effects may occur: Loss of appetite Vomiting Diarrhea Hair loss Eye discharge Dry skin Lethargy Liver irritation Symptoms of liver irritation may include: Vomiting Loss of interest in food Yellow gums, skin or whites of the eyes Human Side Effects While this is a human prescription medication, there are different dosages and side effects that can occur in humans. \u00a0If you accidentally ingest a medication prescribed for your pet, call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222. \u00a0 Monitoring Specific monitoring or routine testing while your pet is on this medication may be recommended by your veterinarian depending on your pet\u2019s individual needs, other medications they may be on, and/or the issue that initially caused your pet to be placed on this medication. If your pet is on Fluconazole long-term, your veterinarian may monitor your pet for changes in liver function. Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) Your pet\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of fluconazole Fluconazole Overdose Information There is limited information on overdoses of fluconazole; only large overdoses are likely to cause a toxic overdose. Symptoms to monitor include shallow breathing, drooling, urinary incontinence, blue gum color, vomiting, and diarrhea. If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian, seek emergency veterinary care, or contact an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply.
