This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Fenbendazole?  Fenbendazole is the active ingredient in several common deworming medications. Fenbendazole treats a wide variety of intestinal parasites including roundworms, hookworms, whipworms, and tapeworms in dogs, horses, and many other animal species.\u00a0\u00a0 Fenbendazole does not treat all types of intestinal worms. Your veterinarian may also prescribe fenbendazole for other types of parasites, including giardia in dogs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fenbendazole is currently not FDA approved as a veterinary medication. However, it is readily utilized in the veterinary field, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs in animals in certain circumstances. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. Follow the directions provided by your veterinarian. If you have questions about parasite control, talk to your veterinarian about the best way to deworm your pet. Fenbendazole is available under the brand names Panacur\u00ae and Safe-guard\u00ae.\u00a0 How Fenbendazole Works  Fenbendazole blocks the ability of worms to produce energy which ultimately starves and kills the parasite. Immature life stages, such as larvae or eggs, may also be affected in some types of worms. You may see worms in your pet\u2019s feces after treatment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fenbendazole is available over-the-counter as single-use packets or by prescription in granule, liquid, chew and capsule forms. To avoid stomach upset, it should be given with food in dogs. Mixing the granules into your pet\u2019s food makes deworming easier. \u00a0 In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of fenbendazole. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the\u00a0 dosage strength\u00a0 is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. Fenbendazole Directions  Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian.\u00a0\u00a0 Fenbendazole is typically given by mouth once daily for three consecutive days. This three-day cycle may be repeated based on the deworming schedule recommended by your veterinarian. Many puppies are dewormed after weaning at 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks of age. Adult dogs may require deworming twice yearly or when parasites are present. Your veterinarian will determine a schedule that is that is appropriate for your pet.\u00a0\u00a0 Fenbendazole does not treat all types of parasites, including the tapeworm spread by fleas. A different type of deworming medication may be necessary, especially if parasites are still present after treatment. Your veterinarian may use fecal tests to determine if parasites are still present.\u00a0 Missed a Dose?\u00a0 If you miss a dose of fenbendazole, give it when you remember. Then, talk to your veterinarian to see if the deworming schedule needs to be adjusted.\u00a0\u00a0 Fenbendazole Possible Side Effects  When used as labeled, side effects are rare. Infrequently, the following side effects may be seen:\u00a0 Vomiting\u00a0 Excessive drooling\u00a0 Diarrhea\u00a0 Allergic reaction (including hives, facial swelling, lethargy, trouble breathing, or collapse)\u00a0 Human Side Effects While this medication can also be used in humans, dosing for pets is often different and it may have different side effects. If you accidentally ingest your pets medication, call your physician or local poison control center. Monitoring No specific monitoring is required for this medication, but your veterinarian may recommend routine testing depending on your pets&#039; individual needs, other medications they may be on and/or the issue that initially caused your pet to be placed on this medication. Call Your Vet If: Side effects are seen (see above)\u00a0\u00a0 You see or suspect an overdose or allergic reaction\u00a0 Call your vet or pharmacist if you have you have additional questions or concerns about the use of fenbendazole\u00a0 Fenbendazole Overdose Information  Overdoses of fenbendazole are unlikely to cause significant problems. However, in rare instances higher doses of fenbendazole may cause a severe allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis. This is due to the release of a substance called antigens by dying parasites. Signs of anaphylaxis may include hives, facial swelling, lethargy, trouble breathing, and collapse. Seek immediate medical treatment if any of these signs are seen.\u00a0\u00a0 If you suspect an overdose of fenbendazole, contact your veterinarian or an animal poison control center.
