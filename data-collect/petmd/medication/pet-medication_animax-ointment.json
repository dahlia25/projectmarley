This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Animax\u00ae Ointment? Animax\u00ae is a topical ointment used commonly in the veterinary field. It is made up of a combination of medications: nystatin (antifungal), neomycin (antibiotic), thiostrepton (antimicrobial), and triamcinolone (steroid). Animax\u00ae is FDA-approved for the treatment of severe and chronic otitis (ear infection) of varied etiologies, for interdigital cysts in cats and dogs, and for anal gland infections in dogs. This veterinarian-prescribed ointment is also approved to help manage certain skin disorders in both cats and dogs. Animax\u00ae is also used in non-food producing horses and cows for skin and ear conditions in an off-label capacity. The term off- or extra- label use means that a medication is prescribed for a certain use, or in a particular species, that is not specified on the medication label. \u00a0Veterinarians can legally prescribe medications for off-label use in certain circumstances. Your veterinarian will determine whether this medication is right for your pet. How Animax\u00ae Ointment Works Animax\u00ae has four active ingredients: nystatin, neomycin, thiostrepton and triamcinolone. Nystatin is a broad-spectrum antifungal that disrupts and weakens the fungal cell wall. Neomycin is an antibiotic which blocks the formation of key proteins in susceptible bacteria, thereby preventing its growth. Because neomycin is poorly absorbed, it mostly remains on the skin\u2019s surface, making it effective against localized skin bacteria. Thiostrepton is an antimicrobial often used in combination with other active ingredients such as neomycin or nystatin. Triamcinolone is a synthetic corticosteroid utilized to decrease inflammation and itching. Animax\u00ae Ointment Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. The frequency of application will depend on the issue, severity, and location. The location you apply the medication to may need to be cleaned and dried before use. If you are applying Animax\u00ae to your pet&#039;s ear, check with your veterinarian to ensure your pet\u2019s tympanic membrane (ear drum) is not ruptured. Wear gloves when applying this medication or wash hands after use. Do not allow your pet to lick the medication until after the area dries. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to apply a dose of Animax\u00ae. Generally, they may recommend that you apply it when you remember, or if it is almost time for your next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal application schedule. Do not apply extra or double amounts. Animax\u00ae Ointment Possible Side Effects Topical irritation at the application site is the most common side effect and may include: Redness Irritation Swelling Temporary hearing loss or deafness, which has been noted in a small number of sensitive pets It is possible, though rare, for topical steroids to become absorbed and cause systemic or body- wide side effects. \u00a0Patients should be closely observed for increased appetite, thirst, or urination, and/or weight gain. Also, speak with your veterinarian about the use of this medication if your pet is or becomes pregnant, as data has shown that corticosteroids administered orally or by injection to animals may result in premature birth or birth defects. Human Side Effects This medication is not intended for use in humans. If you accidentally ingest this medication, seek medical attention or call the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222.\u00a0 Monitoring Your pet should be closely observed for increased appetite, increased thirst or urination, and/or weight gain. Otherwise, no specific monitoring is required for this medication, but your veterinarian may recommend routine testing depending on your pet\u2019s individual needs, other medications they may be on, and/or the issue that initially caused your pet to be placed on this medication. Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) Your pet\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of Animax\u00ae Animax\u00ae Ointment Overdose Information A typical overdose is not common with this product; however, sensitivity or allergic reactions can occur. When using this product for the ears, if your pet is showing signs of hearing loss, deafness, head tilt, circling, decreased balance, or other signs of inner ear issues (vestibular disease), discontinue use and contact your veterinarian immediately. Avoid ingestion. Ingestion of large quantities of this medication may cause body-wide (systemic) concerns like fluid retention, weight gain, and excessive thirst and urination. Prolonged use or overdosage may suppress your pet\u2019s immune system and may result in its body not producing normal steroids on its own, which can cause dangerous side effects if the medication is stopped abruptly.\u00a0 If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian, seek emergency veterinary care, or call an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply.
