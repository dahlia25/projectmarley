This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Baytril\u00ae? Baytril\u00ae is the brand name for a prescription antibiotic called enrofloxacin. Enrofloxacin is an antibiotic in a class called fluoroquinolones, which treat a wide variety of bacteria. It is FDA-approved for use in dogs and cats to manage diseases associated with bacteria that are susceptible to enrofloxacin. In dogs, it is commonly used to treat certain respiratory, urinary tract, and skin infections. In cats, the medication is commonly used for skin infections. In large non-food producing animals, it is commonly used for certain respiratory and skin infections. In non-food producing birds, reptiles, rabbits, ferrets, rats, and other small mammals, Baytril\u00ae is often used for susceptible respiratory infections. The tablet version of Baytril\u00ae is FDA-approved for use in dogs and cats, while the injectable version is approved for use in dogs only. However, it is readily utilized in the veterinary field across many different species, such as non-food producing cattle, horses, small mammals, reptiles, and birds for off-label uses. \u00a0The term off- or extra-label means that a medication is used in a way or in a particular species that is not specified on the medication label. While veterinarians often prescribe medications for off-label uses, your veterinarian will determine whether Baytril\u00ae is right for your pet. \u00a0 It is important to note that Baytril\u00ae is not recommended for use in dogs during the rapid growth phase. Baytril\u00ae and other antibiotics of the fluoroquinolone class can cause abnormal cartilage development in growing animals. This is especially true for growing foals. Speak with your veterinarian about whether your pet is still in its growth stage. How Baytril\u00ae Works Fluoroquinolone antibiotics work by blocking bacteria\u2019s\u2019 DNA replication, which prevents the bacteria from multiplying. In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of Baytril\u00ae. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs.
