This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Meloxicam? Meloxicam is an FDA approved non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is available as a prescription medication to reduce pain, inflammation, and fevers in dogs. It is often used in pets who suffer from a degenerative or inflammatory joint condition, such as arthritis. NSAIDs such as meloxicam help to improve your dog&#039;s overall mobility by relieving joint pain and inflammation. Oral meloxicam is infrequently used for one-time pain relief in cats or short-term use in an off-label manner. Meloxicam is also used off label for pain relief and inflammation in horses, cows, sheep, goats, camels, pigs, birds, rabbits, ferrets, other small mammals and reptiles. This use of meloxicam is currently not FDA approved as a veterinary medication. The term off- or extra- label use means that a medication can be used in a way or in a particular species that are not specified on the medication label. Off- or extra- label use of a medication can only be done by a veterinarian who has direct and personal knowledge of your pet and when there are no other appropriate medications for a particular pet&#039;s circumstances. In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of meloxicam. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. How Meloxicam Works NSAIDs block the production of natural chemicals that trigger inflammation, called a cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway. Some COX pathways are helpful with digestion, kidney health and clotting. In dogs, meloxicam blocks significantly more of the inflammatory chemicals than the beneficial ones. Because of this, meloxicam has fewer side effects in dogs than other NSAIDs, especially those developed for humans. However, at higher doses, meloxicam also partially blocks the beneficial chemicals, so it\u2019s important to follow your veterinarian\u2019s directions carefully. Meloxicam Directions Your veterinarian will prescribe a dosage of meloxicam that is based on your pet\u2019s weight and type of inflammation. Some drugs with meloxicam have two concentrations of liquid, so please ensure that your medication matches the drug label. This medication is typically given once daily and comes as a flavored liquid which can be administered directly to the pet after a meal or given on their food. For further instructions, please follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian.\u00a0 Missed a Dose? If you forget to give a dose of meloxicam, give it when you remember. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and resume your normal every 24-hour dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses.  Meloxicam Possible Side Effects Meloxicam is typically well tolerated by dogs, but serious side effects involving ulcers of the digestive tract, kidney or liver irritation can occur. Side effects are more common in cats.
