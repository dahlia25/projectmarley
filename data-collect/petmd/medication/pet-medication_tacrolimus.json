This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. \u00a0 What is Tacrolimus? Tacrolimus is a medication used to suppress the immune system. Veterinarians typically use tacrolimus in dogs and cats as either a topical skin ointment or an ophthalmic eye drop. Topical tacrolimus is used to treat skin diseases that arise from an overactive immune system such as lupus, pemphigus in dogs or cats, pinnal vascular disease, and perianal fistulas. Ophthalmic tacrolimus is available as an eye drop to treat keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), also known as dry eye in dogs and cats. It can also be used to treat other immune eye conditions such as chronic superficial keratitis (pannus). \u00a0 How Tacrolimus Works Tacrolimus suppresses T-cells of the immune system, which inhibit inflammation by preventing inflammatory signals from being communicated to the rest of the body. T-cells also play an important role in regulating tear gland function, thereby allowing for improved tear production in the treatment of dry eye. Tacrolimus is FDA-approved for human use under the brand names Protopic\u00ae and Prograf\u00ae. Tacrolimus is currently not FDA approved as a veterinary medication. However, it is readily utilized in the veterinary field, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs in animals in certain circumstances. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of tacrolimus. A compounded ophthalmic preparation of tacrolimus is also available. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. Tacrolimus Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. When Tacrolimus is used as an eye medication, make sure to wash your hands before administering this medication. It is important to not touch the tip ointment tube or eye dropper to the surface of the eye, your pets&#039; eyelids, or face. If your pet is using more than one eye medication, it\u2019s recommended to wait at least 5 minutes between medications. Always consult your veterinarian for the best order in which to use your pet\u2019s medicines.\u00a0 When tacrolimus is used as a topical ointment, it should only be applied to the appropriate skin areas as directed. Topical tacrolimus should not be used in the eyes. Pet parents should wear gloves when applying this medication. Don\u2019t allow your pet to lick the area for at least 20-30 minutes after tacrolimus has been applied to avoid ingestion of the medication. Missed a Dose? If you forget to give a dose of tacrolimus, give it when you remember. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses.

Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of tacrolimus Tacrolimus Overdose Information Since tacrolimus is typically used in pets as a topical and medication and eye drop medication, overdoses on these formulations are rare.
