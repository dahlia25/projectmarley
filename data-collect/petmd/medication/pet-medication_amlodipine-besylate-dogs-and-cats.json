This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Amlodipine Besylate? Amlodipine is used for the long-term management of high blood pressure in many species including dogs, cats, and birds. High blood pressure in cats is typically caused by chronic kidney disease and thyroid disease. High blood pressure in dogs can be from various causes, including overactive adrenal gland, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and a certain type of adrenal gland tumor called pheochromocytoma. It may be used as a sole medication for the treatment of high blood pressure but is generally used in combination with other medications. Your veterinarian will determine which combination is best for your pet, based on its circumstances and symptoms. Amlodipine is FDA-approved for human use under the brand names Norvasc\u00ae, Norliqva\u00ae, and Katerzia\u00ae and the generic amlodipine besylate. Amlodipine is currently not FDA-approved as a veterinary medication. However, it is occasionally utilized in the veterinary field, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs in animals in certain circumstances. This practice is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. Your veterinarian will determine whether this medication is right for your pet. Amlodipine is also a prescription medication for humans, frequently with dosages and side effects different from those prescribed for your pet by a veterinarian. Due to possible side effects, pets should not be given any medicine prescribed for humans. In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of amlodipine. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. How Amlodipine Works Amlodipine is classified as a calcium-channel blocker. Amlodipine lowers blood pressure by blocking the movement of calcium into the smooth muscles of the heart and blood vessels. This causes the blood vessels to relax and dilate (widen), which improves blood flow into the heart. Amlodipine Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or per instructions provided by your veterinarian. Generally, your veterinarian will recommend administering amlodipine either with or without \u00a0food, but giving it with food can decrease the risk of digestive upset. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of amlodipine. Generally, they may instruct you to give it when you remember, or if it is almost time for your pet\u2019s next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. Amlodipine Possible Side Effects Side effects of amlodipine may include: Vomiting Diarrhea Decreased appetite Low energy Dehydration Abnormally low blood pressure Abnormally slow heart rate Overgrowth of gums (in dogs) Rarely, more severe side effects may occur: Elevated heart rate Slowed heart rate Collapse Severe weakness Changes in urination Limb swelling Abnormal bleeding Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) You see or suspect an overdose Your pet\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment.
