This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Tylosin Tartrate? Tylosin tartrate is a prescription medication used to treat susceptible infections in livestock. It can also be used to treat certain gastrointestinal issues in dogs and cats. In chickens, tylosin treats digestive and upper airway infections caused by Clostridium and Mycoplasma. In turkeys, tylosin is used in the treatment of sinus infections caused by Mycoplasma. Tylosin can also be used in pigs for infections. Tylosin is also used in honeybees to control a fatal bacterial disease called American Foulbrood. It is rarely prescribed in reptiles and birds for the treatment of Mycoplasma. Horses should never be given tylosin due to the risk of life-threatening diarrhea. In dogs and cats, tylosin is used to treat certain inflammatory diseases of the digestive system such as colitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and may be safer compared to other antibiotics for long-term use. It can also be used to treat certain infections caused by Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, and Clostridium bacteria. The use of tylosin in cats, dogs, and reptiles is considered an off-label use. The term off- or extra- label use means that a medication can be used in a way or in a particular species that is not specified on the medication label. Veterinarians can legally prescribe medications for off-label use in certain circumstances. Your veterinarian will determine whether this medication is right for your animal. In certain circumstances, your veterinarian may recommend a compounded formulation of tylosin. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. For animals meant for human consumption (i.e., food-producing animals), a withdrawal time between last administration of tylosin powder and slaughter varies depending on the animal. Follow directions on the medication label and reach out to your veterinarian to determine when to end the medication before consumption. How Tylosin Tartrate Works Tylosin is classified as a macrolide antibiotic. It is bacteriostatic, which means that it does not actually kill susceptible bacteria. Rather, tylosin prevents bacteria from growing and dividing by blocking its ability to create the required proteins necessary for survival. This allows an animal&#039;s immune system to overcome the infection more easily. Tylosin Tartrate Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Tylosin can be given with or without food. Giving tylosin with food can help to lower the risk of digestive upset. It is important to note that the tylosin powder is extremely bitter, so utilizing a compounded formulation or capsule version of this product can help make it more palatable in dogs and cats. When tylosin is administered in drinking water for poultry, fresh preparations will need to be made every three days and diluted according to the product label. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of tylosin. Generally, they may instruct you to give it when you remember or, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. Tylosin Tartrate Possible Side Effects Like all other antibiotics, tylosin can cause gastrointestinal side effects:\u00a0 Vomiting Diarrhea Decreased appetite Lethargy Human Side Effects This medication is not intended for use in humans. If you accidentally ingest this medication, call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222.\u00a0 When mixing or handling tylosin, use protective clothing and impervious gloves to avoid contact with human skin, as exposure to tylosin may cause a rash. Monitoring No specific monitoring is required for this medication, but your veterinarian may recommend routine testing depending on your pet\u2019s or animal\u2019s individual needs, other medications they may be on, and/or the issue that initially caused your pet or animal to be placed on this medication. Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) Your pet\u2019s or animal\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of tylosin Tylosin Tartrate Overdose Information Symptoms of an overdose of this medication are highly dependent on the species. In general, tylosin is relatively safe, but large overdoses may be a cause for concern. If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian, seek emergency veterinary care, or call an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply.
