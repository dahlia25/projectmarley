This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is DL-Methionine? DL-Methionine is a supplement used in dogs and cats for urine acidification. It aids in the treatment and prevention of a certain type of bladder stone called struvite. DL-Methionine is currently not FDA-approved as a veterinary medication, but it can be used safely in dogs and cats under the direct supervision of your veterinarian in very specific circumstances. DL-Methionine is available in multiple veterinary formulations, including prescription Methio-Form\u00ae chew tablets, prescription Ammonil\u00ae tablets, prescription generic DL-Methionine, and over-the-counter Methigel\u00ae. Certain nutritional supplements also contain DL-Methionine as an ingredient. Struvite stones form in the bladder when urine is less acidic (alkaline), which is typically a result of an underlying urinary tract infection (bacterial infection of the bladder). Feeding your pet a therapeutic urinary diet prescribed by your veterinarian can help dissolve the stones and acidify the urine, and is the most successful and safe solution to treat and manage struvite bladder stones in pets. Antibiotics are also necessary to treat your pet\u2019s urinary tract infection. Your veterinarian may perform diagnostic testing to further investigate the underlying medical cause of your pet\u2019s bladder stones and perform routine recheck tests to assess how well the treatment is working for your pet. In special circumstances where your vet determines that your pet needs additional urine acidification or if a therapeutic urinary diet is not right for your pet, they may prescribe DL-Methionine. DL-Methionine Considerations It is important to note that the use of DL-Methionine in your pet may cause their body to become too acidic. DL-Methionine should not be used in pets with certain medical conditions where acidification could cause harm, such as kidney disease, pancreatic disease, liver disease. It also should not be used to treat other types of urinary stones (oxalate or urate). Giving DL-Methionine with certain medications can result in health risks to your pet, so it is important to discuss your pet\u2019s medications and medical conditions with your veterinarian. DL-Methionine should not be used in kittens, because it can cause toxicity and stunted growth. In humans, DL-Methionine is available as an over-the-counter supplement that comes in a variety of formulations such as tablets, capsules, powders, and topical ointments and creams. Due to possible side effects, pets should not be given any medications intended for humans, as the dosages differ from those prescribed for your pet by a veterinarian. How DL-Methionine Works DL-Methionine is classified as a urine acidification supplement. When it is ingested and processed in the body, DL-Methionine releases sulfur into the urine as sulfuric acid, which makes the urine more acidic. In doing so, it can prevent and treat the formation of struvite stones that only form in alkaline environments.  DL-Methionine Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Generally, your veterinarian will recommend that DL-Methionine is given with food to decrease the risk of digestive upset. Your veterinarian may advise you to divide your pet\u2019s daily dose into multiple meals. Always provide your pet with plenty of water when they are taking DL-Methionine. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of DL-Methionine. Generally, they may instruct you to give it to your pet with food when you remember, or if it is almost time for your pet\u2019s next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule at your pet\u2019s next meal. Do not give extra or double doses. DL-Methionine Possible Side Effects Side effects may include: Loss of appetite Vomiting Loss of balance Human Side Effects DL-Methionine is also a supplement for humans, frequently with dosages different from those prescribed for your pet by a veterinarian. Due to possible side effects, pets should not be given any medicine prescribed for humans. If you accidentally ingest this medication, immediately seek medical attention/call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222. Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) Your pet\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of DL-Methionine DL-Methionine Overdose Information Overdoses of DL-Methionine can be serious. Symptoms of an overdose in dogs may include vomiting, loss of balance, weakness, vocalization, tremors, walking stiffly with exaggerated movements, and disorientation. Symptoms of an overdose in cats may include loss of appetite, red-brown urine, anemia (abnormally low numbers of red blood cells), weakness, loss of balance, and low oxygen levels causing a pale or blue color of the gums. If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian, seek emergency veterinary care, or call an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply.
