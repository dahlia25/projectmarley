This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Vetmedin\u00ae? Vetmedin\u00ae is a medication prescribed for dogs that have been diagnosed with mild, moderate or severe congestive heart failure caused by valvular insufficiency or dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Several studies have shown that pimobendan (the active ingredient in Vetmedin\u00ae) can delay the onset of congestive heart failure in dogs with Mitral Valve Disease (MVD) and DCM and have shown that dogs can also have a better quality of life while on this medication. Vetmedin\u00ae is typically used in combination with other medications commonly prescribed for pets with heart conditions. Vetmedin\u00ae does not treat all types of heart disease. Speak to your veterinarian to see if Vetmedin\u00ae is appropriate for your pet. In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of Vetmedin\u00ae\u2019s active ingredient, pimobendan. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug (such as Vetmedin\u00ae chewable tablets).\u00a0Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs.\u00a0You can learn more about\u00a0compounded medications here. How Vetmedin\u00ae Works Vetmedin\u00ae helps the heart function in two ways. First, it causes vasodilation, which is when the muscles of the blood vessels relax. This allows your dog\u2019s blood vessels to widen for blood to flow more easily. When veins widen, it reduces the back up of blood that causes abnormal fluid accumulation in the lungs and/or body. The widening of arteries reduces the resistance that the heart pumps against and improves blood flow to organs. Vetmedin\u00ae also indirectly acts on the muscle fibers of the heart to improve its ability to contract effectively. This allows the heart to pump blood forward through the heart and increases the volume of blood moved out of the heart to the rest of the body. Vetmedin\u00ae Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Your veterinarian will determine an appropriate dose based on your pet\u2019s weight. This dosage is often split into two doses, usually given 12 hours apart. The morning dose may differ from the evening dose, so follow your veterinarian\u2019s directions closely. Vetmedin\u00ae is recommended to be given on an empty stomach. Vetmedin\u00ae is often given for long periods of time. Do not stop administering Vetmedin\u00ae to your pet without talking to your veterinarian. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of Vetmedin\u00ae. \u00a0Generally, they may advise you to give the dose when you remember. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, your veterinarian may instruct you to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. In most cases, your veterinarian may instruct you to not give extra or double doses.
