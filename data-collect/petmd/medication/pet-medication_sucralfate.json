This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Sucralfate? Sucralfate is a medication used to protect the lining of the digestive tract, specifically the esophagus, stomach, and the upper small intestines. It is available in tablet or liquid form and is effective in preventing ulcers and treating existing ulcers. Sucralfate is used in many species including dogs, cats, horses, ferrets, chinchillas, reptiles, and birds. How Sucralfate Works Sucralfate combines with stomach acid (hydrochloric acid) to form a paste-like coating that binds to the lining of the gastrointestinal system. It also creates a protective barrier over ulcerations in the stomach, duodenum, and esophagus. Sucralfate is FDA-approved for human use under the brand name Carafate\u00ae and as generic sucralfate. Sucralfate is currently not FDA-approved as a veterinary medication. However, it is readily utilized in the veterinary field, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs in animals in certain circumstances. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of sucralfate. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. Sucralfate Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Sucralfate is generally given by mouth every six to 12 hours. Sucralfate should be given on an empty stomach and at least two hours after other medications have been administered. When using the tablets, it is best to crush and then dissolve the tablets in a small amount of water before administering the slurry by mouth. Shake liquid preparations before administration. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of sucralfate. Generally, they may instruct you to give it when you remember or, if it is almost time for your next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. Sucralfate Possible Side Effects Sucralfate is typically well-tolerated and these side effects are generally rare and mild: Constipation Vomiting Drooling Human Side Effects While this is a human prescription medication, there are different dosages and side effects that can occur in humans. \u00a0If you accidentally ingest sucralfate prescribed to your pet, call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222. \u00a0 Monitoring No specific monitoring is required for this medication, but your veterinarian may recommend routine testing depending on your pet\u2019s individual needs, other medications they may be on, and/or the issue that initially caused your pet to be placed on this medication. Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) Your pet\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of sucralfate Sucralfate Overdose Information Overdoses of sucralfate are extremely rare, and even large amounts of this medication are well-tolerated. Signs of overdose may include vomiting, constipation, and drooling. If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian, seek emergency veterinary care, or contact an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply.
