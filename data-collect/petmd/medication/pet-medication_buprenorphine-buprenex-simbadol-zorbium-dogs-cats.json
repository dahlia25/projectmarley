This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Buprenorphine? Buprenorphine is a controlled substance pain medication used to treat mild to moderate pain in dogs and cats. It may also be utilized as a pre-medication given before surgical procedures in animals. Buprenorphine is FDA-approved in two formulations for control of post-operative pain associated with surgical procedures in cats. It is available in a hospital or veterinary clinic setting as an injectable under the brand name Simbadol\u00ae and as a transdermal gel under the brand name Zorbium\u00ae. Buprenorphine is readily utilized in veterinary medicine for off-label use in many dogs, large animals, small mammals, and exotics. Injectable versions of buprenorphine that are FDA-approved for humans under the brand name Buprenex\u00ae are often used off-label in veterinary medicine, as veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs for use in animals in certain circumstances. The term off- or extra-label use means that a medication is prescribed for use in a way or in particular animals that are not specified on the medication label. Veterinarians can legally prescribe medications for off-label use in certain circumstances. Your veterinarian will determine whether this medication is right for your animal. How Buprenorphine Works Buprenorphine partially activates specific receptors in the brain that are responsible for analgesia (pain relief). Due to its partial activity, its analgesic effects are not as strong as other opioids, which is why it is primarily used to treat mild to moderate pain. At higher doses, the pain relief it offers may last longer.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Buprenorphine is classified as a DEA Schedule III controlled substance. As such, this may affect the prescribing, dispensing, and refilling of this medication due to federal and state law. Likewise, it is illegal for you to consume, transfer, sell, or otherwise give away your pet\u2019s buprenorphine. Buprenorphine is also a\u00a0prescription medication for humans, frequently with dosages different from those prescribed for your pet by a veterinarian. Due to possible\u00a0side effects, pets should not be given any medicine prescribed for humans.\u00a0\u00a0 Buprenorphine Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Buprenorphine is mostly used by your veterinarian for pain relief while your pet is in the hospital. If your pet is sent home on buprenorphine, follow the instructions exactly as provided by your veterinarian. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of buprenorphine. They may instruct you to give the missed dose as soon as you remember and wait the normal amount of time until the next dose. If it is almost time for the next dose, your vet may instruct you to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. Buprenorphine Possible Side Effects Excessive drowsiness Slow breathing rate Nausea Vomiting Low heart rate Agitation (panting, purring, pacing, whining, hiding) Loss of appetite Drooling Dilated pupils Constipation Human Side Effects While buprenorphine is also a human prescription medication, there are different dosages for humans and side effects that can occur. Because of the potential for adverse reactions associated with accidental exposure or injection, Simbadol\u00ae and Zorbium\u00ae should only be administered by veterinarians or veterinary technicians who are trained in the handling of potent opioids. \u00a0\u00a0 If you accidentally ingest or inject buprenorphine, Simbadol\u00ae, or Zorbium\u00ae, seek immediate medical attention or call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222. \u00a0If your skin or mucus membranes come into contact with Simbadol\u00ae or Zorbium\u00ae, wash the exposed skin with soap and water or flush the membrane with water and contact a physician immediately. Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) Your pet\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of buprenorphine Monitoring No specific monitoring is required for this medication, but your veterinarian may recommend routine testing depending on your pet\u2019s individual needs, other medications they may be on, or the issue that initially caused your pet to be placed on this medication.  Buprenorphine Overdose Information Buprenorphine overdoses are unlikely to cause life-threatening consequences. Signs of a buprenorphine overdose may include a slow breathing rate, lack of coordination, sedation, drooling, whining or vocalizing, and low body temperature.
