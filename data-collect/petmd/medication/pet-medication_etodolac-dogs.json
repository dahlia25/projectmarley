This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Etodolac? Etodolac is an FDA-approved prescription non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for use in dogs to relieve pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis. Etodolac is FDA-approved for veterinary use in dogs under the brand name EtoGesic\u00ae as an oral and injectable formulation. However, both EtoGesic\u00ae formulations have been discontinued by the manufacturer and are no longer commercially available. Etodolac is also FDA-approved for human use under the brand name Lodine\u00ae and generic etodolac, but it is important to note that the human-labeled products have a higher strength, including extended-release forms, which may not be safe for your dog. Speak with your vet first to ensure this medication is appropriate for your dog. In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of etodolac. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. Etodolac Considerations Etodolac should not be used in pets who are hypersensitive to it. Etodolac should be used with caution in pets with certain medical conditions including dehydration, gastrointestinal disease, liver disease, kidney disease, heart disease, and blood clotting conditions. Giving etodolac with certain medications can result in health risks to your pet, so it is important to discuss your pet\u2019s medications and medical conditions with your veterinarian. Treatment with etodolac requires monitoring and supervision by your veterinarian. Before and during your pet\u2019s treatment, your vet will perform blood tests to evaluate the effects of the medication on the liver and kidneys, as well as eye tests to screen for dry eye disease. It is important to note that etodolac can cause toxicity in cats. Safe use of this medication has not been established or conducted at this time in dogs less than 12 months of age or in breeding, pregnant, or lactating dogs. How Etodolac Works Etodolac is classified as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).\u00a0Like other NSAIDs, it blocks the natural chemicals involved in inflammation, which offers pain relief, lessens inflammation, and reduces fever. Etodolac Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Etodolac can be given with or without food, but giving it with food can decrease the risk of digestive upset. Safety studies have not been performed in dogs less than 12 months of age or in breeding, pregnant, or lactating dogs. Do not use etodolac in cats. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of etodolac. Generally, they may instruct you to give it when you remember, or if it is almost time for your pet\u2019s next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. Etodolac Possible Side Effects Etodolac is generally well tolerated, but in rare cases serious side effects may occur, including: Gastrointestinal upset (decreased appetite, vomiting, diarrhea) Low energy (lethargy) Eye discharge and redness associated with dry eye disease (keratoconjunctivitis sicca, or KCS) Excessive bleeding during surgery Low protein levels Serious adverse reactions associated with this drug class can occur without warning and in rare situations result in death. It is important to stop therapy and contact your veterinarian immediately if you think your dog has a medical problem or side effect from etodolac. Human Side Effects Etodolac is also a prescription medication for humans, frequently with dosages that are different from those prescribed for your pet by a veterinarian. Due to possible side effects, humans should never use medicine dispensed for their pets and pets should not be given any medicine that was dispensed for a human\u2019s use. If you accidentally ingest this medication, immediately call your physician, seek medical attention, or call the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222. Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) Your pet\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of etodolac Etodolac Overdose Information Etodolac has a narrow margin of safety, meaning that only a small amount given over the prescribed dose can result in poisoning. Overdoses of etodolac can be life-threatening and require hospitalization. Symptoms of an overdose may include nausea, vomiting, kidney failure, or liver toxicity. If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian, seek emergency veterinary care, or call an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply.
