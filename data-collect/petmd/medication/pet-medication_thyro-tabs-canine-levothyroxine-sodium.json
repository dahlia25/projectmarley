Thyro-Tabs\u00ae\u00a0contains the active ingredient levothyroxine sodium and is FDA-approved for replacement therapy for diminished thyroid function in dogs. It is primarily used to treat hypothyroidism in dogs. Levothyroxine sodium is also FDA-approved for use in dogs under the brand name ThyroKare\u2122. In cats, it is used for hypothyroidism or for thyroid management after antithyroid treatment for hyperthyroidism. Levothyroxine is also used in horses for the treatment of hypothyroidism or as an additional treatment for equine metabolic syndrome (EMS). It can also be used to treat hypothyroidism in birds and tortoises. How Thyro-Tabs\u00ae Canine (levothyroxine sodium) Works Levothyroxine is a synthetic form of a naturally occurring thyroid hormone called thyroxine. The thyroid gland secretes thyroxine, which is responsible for maintaining metabolism and various physiological processes throughout the body. Pets with hypothyroidism have a thyroxine deficiency because the thyroid gland does not produce adequate amounts of thyroxine. Levothyroxine replaces the missing thyroxine and normalizes thyroid hormone levels in the body. Veterinarians commonly prescribe levothyroxine for off-label use in other species for certain conditions. The term off- or extra- label use means that a medication is prescribed for a certain use, or in a particular species, that is not specified on the medication label. Your veterinarian will determine whether this medication is right for your pet. Thyro-Tabs\u00ae Canine (levothyroxine sodium) Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. This medication is typically administered to dogs once or twice a day. Ideally, it should be given without food and at the same time every day. Dogs may require a much higher dose of thyroid hormone replacement compared with humans, cats, or other species. Your veterinarian will determine the appropriate dose based on your dog\u2019s weight and other factors. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of Thyro-Tabs\u00ae. Generally, they may instruct you to give it when you remember, or, if it is almost time for your next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. Try to give Thyro-Tabs\u00ae as close to the same time each day as possible for best response.

If you accidentally ingest a pet medication, call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222. \u00a0 Monitoring Monitoring of thyroid levels is typically recommended, especially when starting or adjusting doses of levothyroxine.
