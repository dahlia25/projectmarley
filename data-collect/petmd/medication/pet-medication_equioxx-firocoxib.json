This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Equioxx\u00ae? Equioxx\u00ae is an FDA approved non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) prescription medication used in horses to treat pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis. Like other medications in its class, it may also be used to control fevers and inflammation caused by other conditions. Equioxx\u00ae belongs to a subcategory of NSAIDs called COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs) that have the unique property of causing less stomach and intestinal side effects compared to traditional NSAIDs. Equioxx\u00ae is often considered to be the preferred NSAID in the treatment of fever and pain in sick foals because there are fewer side effects compared to other NSAIDs. Equioxx\u00ae is typically well tolerated in horses and is an option for long-term pain relief when used as directed by your veterinarian. How Equioxx\u00ae Works Equioxx\u00ae is a selective NSAID that is subcategorized as a COX-2 inhibitor. Like other NSAIDS, it blocks the body\u2019s COX-2 pathway, which lowers the production of natural chemicals that trigger inflammation\u2014reducing fever and offering pain relief. Due to its selective property, Equioxx\u00ae typically spares the COX-1 pathway that is associated with digestion, kidney health, and blood clotting. This is beneficial because it causes less side effects compared to traditional NSAIDs. However, it\u2019s important to note that Equioxx\u00ae can still partially block these beneficial chemicals at high doses, so it\u2019s important to follow your veterinarian\u2019s directions exactly. Equioxx\u00ae Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Oral Equioxx\u00ae is typically given once daily for up to 14 consecutive days. It may be used for a longer period of time in an extra-label capacity as directed by your veterinarian. The term off- or extra- label use means that a medication is used in a way, or in a particular species, that is not specified on the medication label. \u00a0While veterinarians often prescribe medications for off-label uses, your veterinarian will determine the dose and duration that is right for your horse. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of Equioxx\u00ae. Generally, they will advise you to give it when you remember or, if it is almost time for your next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. In most cases, do not give extra or double doses. Equioxx\u00ae Possible Side Effects Most animals tolerate Equioxx\u00ae well. Possible side effects may include: Sores on the mouth, face, or lips Mouth or stomach ulcers Right dorsal colitis\u2014which can present as diarrhea, dehydration, lethargy, decreased appetite, dark mucus membranes and/or increased heart rate Kidney disease\u00a0 Diarrhea or loose stools Black or tarry stool Loss of appetite Hypoproteinemia (low blood protein levels) which can present as weight loss or swelling of the limbs (edema) Jaundice (yellowing of the gums, skin, or eyes) Treatment with Equioxx\u00ae should be terminated if signs such as inappetence, colic, abnormal feces, or lethargy are observed. If you believe your pet may be experiencing any side effects, consult your veterinarian. Human Side Effects This medication is not used in humans. If you accidentally ingest a pet medication, call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222.\u00a0 \u00a0 Monitoring Specific monitoring or routine testing while your horse is on this medication may be recommended by your veterinarian depending on your horse\u2019s individual needs, other medications they may be on, and/or the issue that initially caused your pet to be placed on this medication. Generally, appropriate laboratory tests should be conducted to establish hematological and serum biochemical baseline data before and periodically during administration of any NSAID. Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) Your horse&#039;s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of Equioxx\u00ae Equioxx\u00ae Overdose Information Oral ulcers were the most common symptom of an Equioxx\u00ae overdose. These ulcers may occur on the face, lips, gums, and/or tongue. Kidney damage is also possible, so monitoring for changes in appetite, energy levels, water intake, and changes in urination is important. If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian, seek emergency veterinary care, or contact an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply. Pet Poison Helpline (855) 764-7661 ASPCA Animal Poison Control (888) 426-4435 Equioxx\u00ae Storage Equioxx\u00ae should be stored according to the medication label and at controlled temperatures between 59-86 F.
