This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Spironolactone? Spironolactone is a medication used in the treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF) in dogs and cats. Specifically in dogs, it is used in the management of myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). It can also be used to treat swelling caused by fluid buildup in the body (edema). Spironolactone is often used in combination with other medications to benefit heart health. Currently, spironolactone is only FDA-approved for use in pets as a combination medication called Cardalis\u00ae that contains two ingredients: spironolactone and benazepril. By itself, spironolactone is FDA-approved for human use under the brand name Aldactone\u00ae and the generic spironolactone. Spironolactone is currently not FDA-approved as a veterinary medication. However, it is readily utilized in the veterinary field, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs in animals in certain circumstances. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. How Spironolactone Works Spironolactone belongs to a class of medications called potassium-sparing diuretics. Diuretics are medications that help reduce swelling by shifting fluid out of the body and into the urine. Spironolactone works in the kidneys, moving sodium and excess fluid out into the urine while sparing other important electrolytes, such as potassium, from exiting the body. In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of spironolactone. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. Spironolactone Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Spironolactone is best given with food to improve its absorption in the body. Your pet\u2019s thirst and urination may increase after starting this medication. It is important to make sure that your pet has access to plenty of fresh water while on this medication. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of spironolactone. Generally, they may instruct you to give it when you remember or, if it is almost time for your next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. Spironolactone Possible Side Effects The most common side effects of spironolactone include stomach upset (loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea) and dehydration. Other side effects may include: Lethargy Incoordination Itchy face (in cats) If you observe that your pet is no longer drinking water or urinating, inform your veterinarian immediately. Human Side Effects While this is a human prescription medication, there are different dosages and side effects that can occur in humans. \u00a0If you accidentally ingest a medication prescribed for your pet, call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222. \u00a0 Monitoring Specific monitoring or routine testing while your pet is on this medication may be recommended by your veterinarian depending on your pet\u2019s individual needs, other medications they may be on, and/or the issue that initially caused your pet to be placed on this medication. Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) Your pet\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of spironolactone Spironolactone Overdose Information Spironolactone is a mild diuretic compared to others (such as furosemide), and an exact toxic dose of this medication is not currently known. Signs of an overdose may include vomiting, low blood pressure, increased thirst and urination, incoordination, dry gums, dehydration, lethargy, and weakness. If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian, seek emergency veterinary care, or call an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply. Pet Poison Helpline (855) 764-7661 ASPCA Animal Poison Control (888) 426-4435 Spironolactone Storage Spironolactone should be stored at controlled room temperatures between 68\u201377 F. Always confirm storage temperatures by reading the label. Keep the container tightly closed in order to protect the medicine from moisture and light. Compounded medications should be stored according to the compounding pharmacy\u2019s label. Keep out of reach of children and pets."}]
