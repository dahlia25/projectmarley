This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Incurin\u00ae? Incurin\u00ae is a short-acting estrogen that treats estrogen-responsive urinary incontinence (urine leaking) in spayed female dogs. All factors that may contribute to urinary incontinence should be considered before this medication is prescribed. How Incurin\u00ae Works Estrogen is a hormone produced by the ovaries in females. Incurin\u00ae treats urinary incontinence specifically caused by low levels of estrogen in spayed female dogs. It increases the muscle tone of the urethral sphincter which allows it to contract and strengthen, preventing urine from leaking. Estriol is a naturally occurring short-acting estrogen. Since estriol is a short-acting hormone, it has a reduced risk for serious side effects. Incurin\u00ae Directions Please follow the directions on the drug label and as provided by your veterinarian. Incurin\u00ae is dosed according to your pet\u2019s individual response to the medication, which means your pet will need to be closely monitored by your veterinarian before any required dosing adjustments can be made. During follow-up visits with your veterinarian, an evaluation of whether your pet\u2019s urinary incontinence is well controlled will determine if the dose can be lowered to a maintenance dose. It is generally recommended to wait 7 days between dosing adjustments. Incurin\u00ae can be given with or without food, but always follow the instructions from your vet. It is important to note that this medication is not dosed by weight. Missed a Dose? If you forget to give a dose of Incurin\u00ae, give it when you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. Incurin\u00ae Possible Side Effects Anorexia/loss of appetite Vomiting Increased thirst Swollen vulva Anxiety Inflammation of the vagina (vaginitis) Lack of energy (lethargy) Aggression/hyperactivity Estrogens have been linked with bone marrow suppression, which is a dangerous condition where your body produces less blood cells. However, this has not been reported with estriol at recommended dosing levels. Human Side Effects Incurin\u00ae can affect the human body. It is recommended to wear gloves when handling or wash hands with soap and water after administration to avoid exposure to the drug. Pregnant, those of child-bearing age or those who are breastfeeding should use caution when administering this medication. This medication is not approved for use in humans. If you accidentally ingest a pet medication, call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222. Monitoring All estrogen medications can potentially affect the bone marrow and may alter thyroid hormone levels, so your veterinarian may recommend routine blood testing before starting this medication, as well as periodically throughout treatment. Your veterinarian may also recommend additional routine testing depending on your pet\u2019s individual needs and other medications they may be on. Call your vet if severe side effects are seen (see above) or you see or suspect an overdose. Call your vet or pharmacist if you have additional questions or concerns about the use of Incurin\u00ae. Incurin\u00ae Overdose Information Acute overdoses are most likely to cause varying levels of vomiting and diarrhea depending on the severity of the overdose. Redness, swelling of the vulva, vulvar discharge, and enlargement of the mammary glands is also possible. Changes in white blood cell counts are also possible. If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian or an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply. Pet Poison Helpline (855) 764-7661 ASPCA Animal Poison Control (888) 426-4435 Incurin\u00ae Storage Incurin\u00ae should be stored at controlled room temperature at or below 77\u00b0F.
