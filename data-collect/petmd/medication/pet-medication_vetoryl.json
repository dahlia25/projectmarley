This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Vetoryl\u00ae? Vetoryl\u00ae is a prescription medication used in the treatment of hyperadrenocorticism or Cushing\u2019s Disease in dogs and cats. Hyperadrenocorticism is when a pet&#039;s adrenal glands produce too much cortisol, which is a naturally occurring steroid produced by the body. While Vetoryl\u00ae is the brand name of this medication, the active ingredient in Vetoryl\u00ae is called trilostane. How Vetoryl\u00ae Works Vetoryl\u00ae is used in the treatment of hyperadrenocorticism, acting as an enzyme to inhibit the production of cortisol, which is overproduced in pets that have Cushing&#039;s Disease. Vetoryl\u00ae does not cure Cushing&#039;s Disease but can manage the disease and improve your pet\u2019s quality of life. In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of trilostane. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. Certain formulations of compounded trilostane may not be as effective at treating hyperadrenocorticism in dogs. Always work with your veterinarian to find the best medication for your pet&#039;s specific needs. Vetoryl\u00ae Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian.
