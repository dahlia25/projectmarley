This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Previcox\u00ae? Previcox\u00ae is an FDA-approved non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) prescription medication used in dogs to treat pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis and for the control of postoperative pain and inflammation associated with soft-tissue and orthopedic surgery. Like other medications in its class, it may also be used off-label to control fevers and inflammation caused by other conditions. The term off-or extra- label use means that a medication is used in a way, or in a particular species, that is not specified on the medication label. While veterinarians often prescribe medications for off-label uses, your veterinarian will determine whether this medication is right for your dog. How Previcox\u00ae Works Previcox\u00ae is a selective NSAID that is subcategorized as a COX-2 inhibitor. Like other NSAIDs, it blocks the body\u2019s COX-2 pathway, which lowers the production of natural chemicals that trigger inflammation, thereby reducing fever and offering pain relief. Due to its selectivity for the COX-2 pathway, Previcox\u00ae typically spares the COX-1 pathway, which is associated with digestion, kidney health and blood clotting. This selectivity is beneficial because it \u00a0causes fewer side effects compared to traditional NSAIDs. However, it\u2019s important to note that at high doses, Previcox\u00ae can still partially block these beneficial chemicals, so it\u2019s important to follow your veterinarian\u2019s directions exactly. Previcox\u00ae Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. This medication is given at different dosages based on what it was prescribed, but it is generally given once daily by mouth at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual response. Giving this medication with food can help to prevent digestive system upset. Please note, this product cannot be accurately dosed in dogs less than 12.5 pounds in body weight. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of Previcox\u00ae. Generally, they will advise that you give it when you remember, or, if it is almost time for your next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. In most cases, do not give extra or double doses. Previcox\u00ae Possible Side Effects Previcox\u00ae is generally well tolerated. Possible side effects include: Vomiting Loss of Appetite Diarrhea Bloody vomiting or diarrhea (black tarry stool) Fatigue (Lethargy) Change in thirst or urination Jaundice (yellowing of the gums, skin, or eyes) Elevated heart rate General itchiness Discontinue Previcox\u00ae and contact your veterinarian immediately if signs of intolerance are observed. Serious adverse reactions associated with this drug class can occur without warning, and in rare situations result in death. Most patients with drug-related adverse reactions have recovered when the signs are recognized, the drug is withdrawn, and veterinary care, if appropriate, is initiated. Human Side Effects This medication is not used in humans. If you accidentally ingest a pet medication, call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222. \u00a0 Monitoring Specific monitoring or routine testing while your dog is on this medication may be recommended by your veterinarian depending on your dog\u2019s individual needs, other medications they may be on, or the issue that initially caused your pet to be placed on this medication. Appropriate laboratory testing is recommended to establish hematological and serum baseline data before and periodically during administration of any NSAID. Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) Your dog\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of Previcox\u00ae Previcox\u00ae Overdose Information Decreased appetite, vomiting, black tarry stool, increased heat rate, fatigue (lethargy), kidney failure, and seizures are associated with overdoses of Previcox\u00ae. More severe symptoms may occur depending on the severity of the overdose. If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian, seek emergency veterinary care, or contact an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply.
