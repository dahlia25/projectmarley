This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet.\u00a0 What is Metronidazole? Metronidazole is an antibiotic and antiprotozoal medication that kills certain types of bacteria and protozoa parasites. In dogs and cats, it is most commonly used to treat infections of the digestive tract. Metronidazole targets certain types of bacteria called anaerobic bacteria, which are bacteria that do not require oxygen to survive. It also treats protozoal parasites, such as giardia, especially when given in combination with other drugs. Metronidazole can also be used to treat certain kinds of inflammation in the digestive tract. Metronidazole is FDA-approved for human use under the brand name Flagyl\u00ae. Metronidazole is currently not FDA approved for use in animals. However, it is readily utilized in the veterinary field, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs for use in animals in certain circumstances. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use is not described on the drug label. Speak with your veterinarian about whether metronidazole is right for your pet. In certain circumstances,\u00a0your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of metronidazole. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. How Metronidazole Works Metronidazole kills bacteria by disrupting their DNA. It is not known how it kills protozoal parasites. Metronidazole is also used to treat inflammatory diseases in the digestive tract and is thought to accomplish this by blocking certain inflammatory mechanisms. Metronidazole Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. The exact dose of metronidazole depends on your pet\u2019s weight, as well as the type of bacteria or parasite present. Metronidazole is typically given with food and should be given for the full treatment period prescribed by your veterinarian. Missed a Dose? If you forget to give a dose of metronidazole, give it when you remember. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses.  Metronidazole Possible Side Effects Metronidazole is generally well tolerated in dogs and cats. Side effects can include: Vomiting or diarrheaFatigue (lethargy)WeaknessLow white blood cell countsBlood in the urineLoss of appetiteYellowing of gums, skin, or whites of the eyesNeurologic symptoms including lack of coordination, dilated pupils, abnormal eye movements called nystagmus or seizuresNeurologic side effects are more common in pets receiving higher doses or are on this medication for long periods of time. Metronidazole has been shown to be carcinogenic in mice and rats. Unnecessary use of the drug should be avoided. Its use should be reserved for the conditions as determined by your veterinarian. Human Side Effects While metronidazole is a prescription medication approved for use in humans, there are different dosages from those given to animals and side effects that can occur in humans.\u00a0 Pregnant women or individuals allergic to metronidazole\u00a0should wear gloves when handling the medication and wash their hands after use.
