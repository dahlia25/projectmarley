This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Onsior\u00ae? Onsior\u00ae (robenacoxib) is a non-narcotic, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) prescription medication, available in tablet form or as an injection. Onsior\u00ae is FDA-approved for use in cats to control postoperative pain and inflammation associated with orthopedic surgery, ovariohysterectomy, and castration in cats 4 months and older (and greater than 5.5 pounds if using tablets), for a maximum of three days. In dogs, Onsior\u00ae is FDA-approved for the control of postoperative pain and inflammation associated with soft tissue surgery in dogs greater that 4 months of age, for up to a maximum of three days. Onsior\u00ae is also utilized off-label for the treatment of pain and inflammation that occurs with osteoarthritis in dogs and cats. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. Note, the doses of Onsior\u00ae tablets and injection are different. How Onsior\u00ae Works Onsior\u00ae is a selective NSAID that is subcategorized as a COX-2 inhibitor. Like other NSAIDs, it blocks the body\u2019s COX-2 pathway, which lowers the production of natural chemicals that trigger inflammation, thereby offering pain relief. Due to its selectivity for the COX-2 pathway, Onsior\u00ae\u00a0typically spares the COX-1 pathway, which is associated with digestion, kidney health and blood clotting. This selectivity is beneficial because it causes fewer side effects compared to traditional NSAIDs. However, it\u2019s important to note that at high doses, Onsior\u00ae\u00a0can still partially block these beneficial chemicals, so it\u2019s important to follow your veterinarian\u2019s directions exactly. Onsior\u00ae Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Onsior\u00ae may initially be administered to your dog or cat as an injection in the hospital. Future doses can be given as an oral tablet or injection, with or without food. It is important to remember that Onsior\u00ae can be given for a maximum of three (3) days. Further, subject to your veterinarian\u2019s instructions, do not administer Onsior\u00ae in conjunction with any other oral or injectable NSAID or corticosteroid. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of Onsior\u00ae. Generally, they may advise you to give it when you remember. However, because this medication is only supposed to be administered once a day for a maximum of three (3) days, your vet may instruct you to wait if it is almost time for the next dose, or to give the dose when you remember a full day before administering the next dose. Do not give extra or double doses. Onsior\u00ae Possible Side Effects Like other NSAIDs, side effects with Onsior\u00ae may include: Vomiting Diarrhea Decreased appetite Blood in the stool or vomit Dark or tarry stool Weight loss Kidney injury When Onsior\u00ae is given to a pet after a surgery, additional symptoms may include: Bleeding from the incision site Irritation or infection at the incision site Increased bruising Human Side Effects This medication is not for use in humans. If you accidentally ingest or inject this medication, call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222.\u00a0 Monitoring Specific monitoring or routine testing while your pet is on this medication may be recommended by your veterinarian depending on your pet\u2019s individual needs, other medications they may be on, and/or the issue that initially caused your pet to be placed on this medication. Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) Your pet\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of Onsior\u00ae Onsior\u00ae Overdose Information Overdoses of Onsior\u00ae can cause toxicity in the digestive system, kidneys, and liver like other NSAIDs. Symptoms may include vomiting, lethargy, diarrhea, loss of appetite, blood in the vomit or feces, dark or coffee ground stool, increased thirst or urination, or bloody urine. If you suspect an overdose, stop administration of Onsior\u00ae and immediately contact your veterinarian, seek emergency veterinary care, or contact an animal poison control center.
