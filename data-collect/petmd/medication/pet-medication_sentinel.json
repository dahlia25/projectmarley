This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Sentinel\u00ae? Sentinel\u00ae\u00a0contains two active ingredients, milbemycin oxime and lufenuron. It is indicated for adult dogs and puppies weighing more than two pounds and older than 4 weeks of age, for the prevention of heartworm disease, for the prevention and control of flea populations, the control of adult\u00a0hookworms, and the removal and control of adult roundworms and whipworms. What Is Sentinel Spectrum\u00ae? Sentinel Spectrum\u00ae contains the same active ingredients as Sentinel\u00ae, along with the addition of a third ingredient, praziquantel, to provide the additional benefit of preventing and controlling tapeworm infections. Sentinel Spectrum\u00ae is intended for dogs and puppies weighing more than two pounds and older than 6 weeks of age. How Sentinel\u00ae Works The main active ingredient in both Sentinel\u00ae and Sentinel Spectrum\u00ae is milbemycin oxime. Milbemycin shifts chloride, a naturally occurring electrolyte, across the cell membrane of certain susceptible worms such as heartworms, roundworms, whipworms and hookworms. By overloading chloride into these worms, it affects the electrical activity within their nervous system, causing muscle paralysis and death. Lufenuron is another active ingredient in Sentinel\u00ae and Sentinel Spectrum\u00ae. Lufenuron only targets flea eggs and prevents them from developing and hatching. Since lufenuron does not kill adult fleas, it is typically used in combination with other medications to treat active flea infestations. Praziquantel, the third active ingredient in Sentinel Spectrum\u00ae, adds protection against tapeworms. The way in which praziquantel works against tapeworms is not entirely known, but it is suspected that it interferes with integrity of the worm&#039;s skin and causes paralysis. Sentinel\u00ae and Sentinel Spectrum\u00ae Directions Sentinel\u00ae and Sentinel Spectrum\u00ae is administered by mouth once a month. It may be given with or without food. However, giving this medication with food improves absorption of this medication into a dog\u2019s system. Efforts should be made to ensure that the chewable is chewed and not swallowed whole. If your dog did not consume all the chew, redosing with a new chewable is recommended. Missed a Dose? If you forget to give a dose of Sentinel\u00ae or Sentinel Spectrum\u00ae, give it when you remember. Sentinel\u00ae and Sentinel Spectrum\u00ae are given once a month and the schedule should follow as close to every 30 days as possible in between doses. If your veterinarian has directed you to give this medication on a different dosing schedule, please contact them for further instructions if a dose was missed. Do not give extra or double doses.

Dogs with existing heartworm infections should be treated to remove the adult heartworms before starting this medication.
