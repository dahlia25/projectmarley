This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Diazepam? Diazepam is a controlled-substance medication used in veterinary medicine to relieve anxiety, stimulate appetite, and help manage sedation and anesthesia. It is also used in the emergency treatment of seizures and muscle spasms. Diazepam is available in multiple formulations such as an injection, oral tablet, oral solution, and rectal gel. It is mostly used in dogs short-term or as a single dose. Diazepam injections are only used for sedation and anesthesia in cats, horses, sheep, goats, alpacas, birds, ferrets, rabbits, rodents, and other small mammals. Diazepam can be used either as a solo medication or in combination with other medications. Your veterinarian will determine whether this medication and which type of medication formula is right for your pet. It is important to note that if a dog takes diazepam long-term, they can build up a tolerance to it, which means if they are having seizures, then a typical emergency dose of diazepam may not be as effective. Your veterinarian may prefer other anticonvulsant (anti-seizure) medications for long-term management of seizures in dogs. Diazepam is FDA-approved for human use under the brand names Valium\u00ae, Diastat\u00ae, Valtoco\u00aeand the generic diazepam. Diazepam is currently not FDA-approved as a veterinary medication. However, it is readily utilized in the veterinary field, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs in animals in certain circumstances. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of diazepam medication. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. Diazepam is classified as a DEA Schedule IV controlled substance. As such, this may affect the prescribing, dispensing, and refilling of this medication due to federal and state law. Likewise, it is illegal for you to consume, transfer, sell, or otherwise give away your pet\u2019s diazepam. How Diazepam Works Diazepam is classified as a benzodiazepine. It enhances the activity of certain chemical messengers in the brain responsible for slowing down, stabilizing, and calming the nervous system. This causes sedation, muscle relaxation, and the suppression of seizures. Diazepam Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or per the instructions as provided by your veterinarian. Generally, your veterinarian will recommend that diazepam can be given with or without food, but providing it with food can decrease the risk of digestive upset. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of diazepam. Generally, they may instruct you to give it when you remember, or if it is almost time for your pet\u2019s next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. Diazepam Possible Side Effects Common side effects of diazepam may include: Grogginess Loss of balance Less common side effects of diazepam may include: Overexcitement Increased appetite Muscle tremors (horses) Diazepam oral tablets and oral suspension should not be used in cats, as a life-threatening liver problem can occur. Signs of liver injury may include jaundice (yellowing of eyes, gums, and skin), weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, and weakness. Diazepam should not be used in pets with a known hypersensitivity to the medication. Human Side Effects Diazepam is also a prescription medication for humans, frequently with dosages different from those prescribed for your pet by a veterinarian. Due to possible side effects, pets should not be given any medicine prescribed for humans. If you accidentally ingest a pet medication, call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222. Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) Your pet\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment. You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of diazepam Diazepam Overdose Information Signs of a diazepam overdose in pets are typically related to the nervous system, such as decreased muscle reflexes or confusion. If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian, seek emergency veterinary care, or call an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply. Pet Poison Helpline (855) 764-7661 ASPCA Animal Poison Control (888) 426-4435 Diazepam Storage Diazepam tablets should be stored at controlled room temperature between 68-77 F.
