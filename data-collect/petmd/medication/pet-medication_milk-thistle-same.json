This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Milk Thistle/SAMe? Milk Thistle/SAMe is a supplement or nutraceutical containing two ingredients\u2014milk thistle and SAMe (S-adenosylmethionine). Nutraceuticals are not pharmaceutical medications, because they derive from natural substances such as plants. Nutraceuticals may be prescribed by a veterinarian as a supplement to improve health or protect against chronic disease. Milk thistle and SAMe are utilized together as a liver protectant and antioxidant for pets with acute liver injury, chronic liver disease, and hepatic lipidosis. They can also be used in pets that are on medications that can cause liver irritation, or to support the liver when certain toxins have been ingested. Research suggests\u00a0that using milk thistle and SAMe together may have a supportive effect on brain function in older dogs with cognitive decline. Consult your veterinarian before giving this supplement to your pet. Denamarin\u00ae\u00a0is an over-the-counter supplement that contains silybin (the active compound extracted from the milk thistle plant) and SAMe. It is marketed as a supplement for dogs and cats that have liver disease. Veterinarians may also prescribe milk thistle/SAMe for use in horses, birds, ferrets, and rabbits. In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of milk thistle/SAMe. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. How Milk Thistle/SAMe Works SAMe has been shown to help protect liver cells from damage and may help liver cells repair and regenerate. Milk thistle contains silybin, which is the potent active compound responsible for its potent and beneficial antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. There are two commercially available forms of milk thistle and SAMe, Denamarin\u00ae and Denamarin\u00ae Advanced. The silybin component of Denamarin\u00ae has been shown to have better absorption in dogs compared to other milk thistle extract products. Denamarin\u00ae Advanced is a medication that contains the same two active ingredients but contains a proprietary formula that makes it easier for the body to absorb and reap its benefits. Denamarin\u00ae Advanced is only available from your veterinarian. Nutraceuticals are not regulated by the FDA, which is why there are no FDA-approved milk thistle/SAMe products. Denamarin\u00ae is a patented formulation and is labeled as a milk thistle/SAMe product. Speak with your veterinarian about whether milk thistle/SAMe products are right for your pet. Milk Thistle/SAMe Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. For best absorption, it should be given on an empty stomach at least one hour before a meal. It can be given with a small treat or bite of food, if needed. When giving Denamarin\u00ae or milk thistle/SAMe to cats, it is best to follow the tablet administration with 3-6 milliliters (mL) of water by mouth, to help the tablet make its way down into the stomach. Enteric-coated tablet versions of Denamarin\u00ae or milk thistle/SAMe should not be split or crushed before administration. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian if you forget to give a dose of Denamarin\u00ae or milk thistle/SAMe. Generally, they may recommend that you give it when you remember, or, if it is almost time for your next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. Milk Thistle/SAMe Possible Side Effects Milk thistle/SAMe is generally well tolerated by most pets. Side effects are rare but may include: Decreased appetite Vomiting Diarrhea Human Side Effects While milk thistle and SAMe are used in human medicine, there are different dosages and side effects can occur in humans.
