Amantadine is an antiviral drug that was historically used in horses to treat equine influenza. It is now infrequently utilized for this illness and is typically prescribed along with other pain relief medications such as NSAIDS (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) or gabapentin to treat chronic pain in dogs and cats. Examples of chronic pain that are best treated with amantadine include arthritis, neurologic pain, and pain associated with cancer.\u00a0 Amantadine is available under the brand names Symmetrel\u00ae, Gocovri\u00ae, Osmolex ER\u00ae, and Endantadine\u00ae. This is called extra-label, or sometimes off-label use, because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label.\u00a0 How Amantadine Works  Amantadine inhibits the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor. This is a receptor in the nervous system that binds to neurotransmitters (a chemical used to transfer a nerve impulse from one nerve cell to the next) that can create a sensation of pain. The NMDA receptor is involved in wind-up pain, which causes a feeling of sustained pain when the nervous system is subjected to repeated stimulation. By blocking these NMDA receptors, amantadine helps alleviate chronic pain, especially when used together with other pain control medications.\u00a0 Amantadine Directions This medication is most often administered daily, but frequency may vary. It can be given with or without food. Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian.\u00a0\u00a0 Missed a Dose?\u00a0 If you forget to give a dose of amantadine, give it when you remember. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses.\u00a0\u00a0 Amantadine Possible Side Effects  The most common side effects with amantadine are mild and generally resolve with time. These include:\u00a0 Agitation\u00a0\u00a0 Loose or soft stools\u00a0 Flatulence\u00a0 Diarrhea\u00a0 Amantadine also has anticholinergic effects (meaning that it can block the action of certain neurotransmitters responsible for the parasympathetic nervous system), which can cause symptoms of increased thirst, urinary retention, and an increased heart rate.\u00a0 Human Side Effects\u00a0 While this is a human prescription medication there are different dosages and side effects that can occur in humans. If you accidentally ingest this medication, call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222.\u00a0 Monitoring\u00a0 No specific monitoring is required for this medication. However, your veterinarian may recommend routine testing depending on your pets&#039; individual needs to monitor the issue that initially caused your pet to be placed on this medication.\u00a0 Call Your Vet If:\u00a0 Severe side effects are seen (see above)\u00a0 You see or suspect an overdose\u00a0 You have additional questions or concerns about the use of amantadine\u00a0 Amantadine Overdose Information  Symptoms of an overdose of amantadine may include tremors (shaking), trouble breathing, lack of coordination, increased salivation, and vomiting. If you suspect an overdose or notice any of these symptoms immediately contact your veterinarian or an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply.\u00a0 Pet Poison Helpline (855) 764-7661\u00a0 ASPCA Animal Poison Control (888) 426-4435\u00a0 Amantadine Storage  Amantadine should be stored at controlled room temperatures between 68-77\u00b0F. It can be briefly exposed to temperatures between 59\u00b0-86\u00b0F. Keep the container tightly closed when not in use to protect the capsules from moisture and light.\u00a0 Keep out of reach of children and pets.\u00a0"}]
