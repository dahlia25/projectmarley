This may help dissolve certain kinds of bladder stones or help promote some toxins to be expelled in the urine. Ammonium chloride may also be used in conjunction with antibiotics to make them more effective. How It Works Ammonium chloride works by acidifying the urine. The kidney uses the ammonium in this drug as opposed to the sodium it typically uses, turning it into urea, H+, and Cl-, which leads to acidification of the urine.
