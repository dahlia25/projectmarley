This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. \u00a0 What is Albon\u00ae? Albon\u00ae (sulfadimethoxine) is a sulfonamide antibiotic commonly used to treat coccidiosis in dogs, cats, and other animals. Coccidiosis is an intestinal disease caused by coccidia, which are a type of protozoa (a microscopic, single-celled organism). Coccidiosis can cause diarrhea in dogs and cats. A fecal test is necessary to determine if coccidia are present in your pet\u2019s feces and digestive tract. If so, your veterinarian may prescribe Albon\u00ae to treat the infection. Albon\u00ae can also be used to treat susceptible bacterial infections in many parts of the body. These infections may occur in the skin, soft tissues, respiratory tract, urinary tract, or digestive tract. However, Albon\u00ae does not treat all types of infections. Albon\u00ae should only be used under the direction of a veterinarian. How Albon\u00ae Works The active ingredient in Albon\u00ae is sulfadimethoxine. It belongs to a class of antibiotics called sulfonamides. This type of antibiotic interferes with bacteria\u2019s ability to produce folic acid, which is essential for bacteria to grow. Sulfadimethoxines such as Albon\u00ae are only effective against bacteria that can produce their own folic acid. Sulfadimethoxines are also effective against some types of protozoa, including coccidia species. The drug is not effective against all species of bacteria, viruses, or rickettsia. Albon\u00ae Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or provided by your veterinarian. For Albon\u00ae to work properly, it must be given exactly as directed by your veterinarian. Like other antibiotics, Albon\u00ae should be administered for the entire length of treatment prescribed by your veterinarian. In most cases, the signs of infection will be absent for the last few days of treatment. It is still important to finish the treatment course even if your pet seems to have recovered from the infection. Giving antibiotics at smaller doses or for a shorter period than prescribed can result in recurrent infections and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Albon\u00ae can be given with or without food. If your pet experiences digestive upset (like vomiting or diarrhea) after taking Albon\u00ae, try giving future doses with a meal. Make sure your pet always has free access to water. Animals taking Albon\u00ae should not get dehydrated. Tablets: To make the tablets easier to give, you can hide the tablet in small amounts of food or in treats designed to hide tablets. Talk to your veterinarian if you are still having trouble medicating your pet. Oral suspension (liquid): Shake the Albon\u00ae oral suspension well before use. Measure the liquid carefully using the syringe or other dosing device provided by your veterinarian or pharmacist. Liquid Albon\u00ae is flavored to taste like custard. Pets often like the taste and will take the medication willingly. Albon\u00ae oral suspension does not need to be refrigerated, but confirm with the recommendations on the packaging. Missed a Dose? If you forget to give a dose of Albon\u00ae, give it when you remember. However, if it is less than 12 hours before the scheduled time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses.
