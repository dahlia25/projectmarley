It is commonly used in humans to treat ingidestion and diarrhea, but is sometimes used by veterinarians to treat the same symptoms in dogs. It is not safe to give to cats. How It Works The bismuth component of this drug seems to coat the intestines, protecting it from toxins. It also has weak antibacterial qualities against bacteria such as Heliobacter. The salicylate component (salicylate is a substance similar to aspirin) seems to have a slight antiprostaglandin effect, assisting in the treatment of some types of diarrhea. Prostaglandins are hormone-like substances that promote the secretion of fluids, often causing diarrhea. Storage Information Store in a tightly sealed container at room temperature. Missed Dose?
