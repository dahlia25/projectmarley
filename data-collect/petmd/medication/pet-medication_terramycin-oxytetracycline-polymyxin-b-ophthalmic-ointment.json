This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Terramycin\u00ae?  Terramycin\u00ae ophthalmic ointment treats eye infections in dogs, cats, and other animals. It is a broad-spectrum antibiotic, which means that it can kill many types of bacteria.\u00a0 Terramycin\u00ae ophthalmic ointment is an FDA-approved animal OTC drug, which means that it is available without a prescription in most of the United States (a prescription is required in California).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although it is available without a prescription, it is important to consult your veterinarian before giving it to your pet because what looks like an eye infection may actually be a severe eye condition like eosinophilic keratoconjunctivitis, which is suspected to be caused by a virus and cannot be treated with an antibiotic. Only your veterinarian can rule out these serious conditions and accurately diagnose your pet.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How Terramycin\u00ae Works  Terramycin\u00ae ophthalmic ointment treats pink eye and other eye infections of the conjunctiva, cornea, or eyelid. In addition, veterinarians may prescribe Terramycin\u00ae to treat corneal ulcers (an open sore on the clear surface of the eye). Terramycin\u00ae also treats eye infections that result from body-wide infectious diseases, such as distemper in dogs.\u00a0\u00a0 The active ingredients in Terramycin\u00ae ophthalmic ointment are oxytetracycline and polymyxin B. Oxytetracycline is an antibiotic that kills susceptible bacteria by disrupting their ability to make certain proteins that are required for the bacteria to survive. Oxytetracycline can also help heal corneal ulcers by blocking specific proteins that damage the cornea. Polymyxin B kills organisms by altering their cell membranes. These active ingredients work together to kill a wide range of bacteria.\u00a0\u00a0 The misuse\u00a0of antibiotics, including Terramycin\u00ae ophthalmic ointment, can result in the overgrowth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Talk to your veterinarian if your pet\u2019s infection does not resolve or worsens. \u00a0 Terramycin\u00ae Directions  Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian.\u00a0 Wash your hands before administering Terramycin\u00ae or any other eye medication.\u00a0 To avoid contamination, do not touch the applicator tip with your finger, your pet\u2019s eye, or any other object.\u00a0 Apply a \u00bc-inch strip of ointment to the affected eye(s) 2-4 times per day, or as directed by your veterinarian. To apply, gently pull down the lower eyelid and apply the medication into the space between the lid and the eye.\u00a0\u00a0 The eyelid will spread the medication over the surface of the eye when your pet blinks.\u00a0 Gently wipe any remaining medication from your pet\u2019s skin or face with a tissue or damp washcloth.\u00a0\u00a0 Wait 5-10 minutes after use before applying any other eye medications.\u00a0\u00a0 Contact your veterinarian if you have difficulty administering this medication or have any questions regarding the treatment.\u00a0 Individuals sensitive to tetracycline class antibiotics and pregnant women should use caution when handling this class of medications (tetracyclines). Missed a Dose?\u00a0 If you forget a dose, apply the medication when you remember and resume your dosing schedule. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose. Do not give extra or double doses.\u00a0 Terramycin\u00ae Possible Side Effects  Life-threatening allergic reactions can occur, especially in cats. Emergency veterinary care is often necessary. Contact your veterinarian immediately if your pet exhibits any of the following signs:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Swelling of the face\u00a0\u00a0 Itching\u00a0 Weakness\u00a0 Vomiting\u00a0 Difficulty breathing\u00a0 Animals typically tolerate Terramycin\u00ae ophthalmic ointment very well. However, eye irritation or redness may occur.\u00a0\u00a0 Talk to your veterinarian before using Terramycin\u00ae in young or pregnant animals. Oral or injectable medications in the same class of Terramycin\u00ae (tetracyclines) can impact bone development and cause discoloration of the teeth in young, growing animals. High doses or long-term use can delay growth and healing. Human Side Effects This medication is not approved for use in humans. If you accidentally ingest this medication or use it in your own eye, please call your physician or local poison control center. Monitoring No specific monitoring is required for this medication, but your veterinarian may recommend routine testing depending on your pets&#039; individual needs, other medications they may be on and/or the issue that initially caused your pet to be placed on this medication. Call Your Vet If:\u00a0\u00a0 Side effects are seen (see above)\u00a0 Your pet eats or ingests the eye ointment\u00a0 You see or suspect an overdose\u00a0 If your pet\u2019s infection does not resolve or worsens Call your vet or pharmacist if you have additional questions or concerns about the use of Terramycin\u00ae ophthalmic ointment.\u00a0 Terramycin\u00ae Overdose Information  Overdoses can occur if an animal eats or otherwise consumes Terramycin\u00ae ophthalmic ointment. If this occurs, immediately contact your veterinarian or an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply.\u00a0 Pet Poison Helpline (855) 764-7661\u00a0 ASPCA Animal Poison Control (888) 426-4435\u00a0 Terramycin\u00ae Storage  Store at room temperature between 68-77\u00b0F (20-25\u00b0C).
