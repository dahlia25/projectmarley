This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice from your vet. What Is Telmisartan? Telmisartan is a prescription blood pressure medication used in the treatment of cats and dogs. Telmisartan is used in dogs for treatment of high blood pressure (hypertension) and excessive protein leakage into the urine (proteinuria) due to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Telmisartan can be given alone but is more often used in combination with other medications. Semintra\u00ae Oral Solution (active ingredient telmisartan) is FDA-approved for use in cats for the control of systemic high blood pressure (hypertension). It is also used, but not FDA-approved for, treatment of excessive protein leakage into the urine (proteinuria) due to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Telmisartan is FDA-approved for human use under the brand name Micardis\u00ae and generic telmisartan. Telmisartan is currently not FDA-approved as a veterinary medication for use in dogs. However, it is readily utilized in the veterinary field, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs for use in animals in certain circumstances. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. Your veterinarian will determine whether this medication is right for your dog. In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded capsule formulation or compounded oral liquid formulation of telmisartan. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. Telmisartan Considerations Telmisartan should not be used in pets with certain medical conditions, such as pregnancy, low blood pressure (hypotension), dehydration, abnormal electrolyte levels (low sodium and low potassium), moderate to severe liver disease, and in pets who are hypersensitive to it. Telmisartan studies have not been performed in pets younger than 9 months of age. Giving telmisartan with certain medications can result in health risks to your pet, so it is important to discuss your pet\u2019s medications and medical conditions with your veterinarian. How Telmisartan Works Telmisartan is in a class of medications called ARBs (angiotensin II receptor blockers). Telmisartan works by blocking certain receptors in the kidneys, blood vessels, and heart that affect blood pressure and electrolyte balance. By relaxing blood vessels, telmisartan decreases blood pressure in the kidneys and reduces protein leakage into the urine. Telmisartan Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Telmisartan is best absorbed when given on an empty stomach, but it may be given with or without food. This medication should not be given to pregnant or nursing animals. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of telmisartan. Generally, they may instruct you to give it when you remember, or if it is almost time for your pet\u2019s next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. Telmisartan Possible Side Effects Vomiting Diarrhea Loss of appetite Low energy level (lethargy) Weight loss (cats) Dehydration Fainting and weakness due to low blood pressure (hypotension) Decreased levels of red blood cells (anemia) Human Side Effects If you are pregnant, avoid contact with telmisartan, as substances such as ARBs can cause fetal and neonatal birth defects and death during pregnancy in humans. While telmisartan is prescribed for use in humans, never ingest telmisartan prescribed for your pet. Wear disposable gloves when administering the medication and wash your hands afterward. Telmisartan dosages are frequently different from those prescribed for your pet by a veterinarian. Due to possible side effects, pets should never be given any medicine dispensed for a human\u2019s use. If you accidentally ingest a pet medication, call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222. Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) Your pet\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of telmisartan Telmisartan Overdose Information Signs of an overdose of telmisartan may include lethargy, loss of appetite, trembling, vomiting, abnormally high or abnormally low heart rate, or low blood pressure. If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian, seek emergency veterinary care, or call an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply.
