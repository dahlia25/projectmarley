This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Galliprant\u00ae? Galliprant\u00ae is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used in the management of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis in dogs. How Galliprant\u00ae Works Traditional NSAIDs work by suppressing prostaglandin. Prostaglandins are a group of chemicals that the body releases at sites of inflammation, tissue damage and infection. However, the effects of prostaglandins can cause several side effects including constriction of blood vessels, contraction of smooth muscles in the digestive system, and the formation of blood clots. Galliprant\u00ae does not suppress prostaglandins, but instead blocks a prostaglandin receptor which is involved in generating pain and inflammation. By not suppressing prostaglandins, blood clotting, constriction of blood vessels, and contraction muscles of the digestive system are not impacted. Galliprant\u00ae Directions Check instructions on the label and from your veterinarian. Galliprant\u00ae is usually given once a day. The lowest effective dose is recommended to be given over the shortest period of time and is dependent on your pet\u2019s response to the medication. Avoid giving Galliprant\u00ae with food because it is best absorbed on an empty stomach. Missed a Dose? If you forget to give a dose of Galliprant\u00ae, give it when you remember and resume daily administration from that time. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses.
