This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Apoquel\u00ae? Apoquel\u00ae is an allergy medication that treats itching and inflammation in dogs by targeting an important itch signal in a dog\u2019s body, helping to stop the itch before it starts. Apoquel\u00ae starts working within 4 hours and helps stop itching within 24 hours. Veterinarians prescribe Apoquel\u00ae either short-term for allergic flare-ups or long-term for the management of skin allergies. How Apoquel\u00ae Works Apoquel\u00ae controls the itching caused by allergic skin diseases. It also controls atopic dermatitis, which is a common, long-term inflammatory skin disease caused by environmental allergies in dogs. Apoquel\u00ae inhibits Janus kinase, an important signal that triggers itching and inflammation in allergic dogs. By inhibiting this itch signal, Apoquel\u00ae reduces the cause of itching at a cellular level. It can also reduce the effects of some inflammatory signals in the body. As a result, allergic dogs that take Apoquel\u00ae do not feel as itchy and scratch less. The skin inflammation caused by allergies is also reduced. Apoquel\u00ae Directions Follow the directions on the label and as provided by your veterinarian. Give Apoquel\u00ae tablets by mouth. Apoquel\u00ae can be given with or without food. If your dog vomits after taking Apoquel\u00ae, try giving it with some food or a meal after consulting with your vet. Apoquel\u00ae is approved for use in dogs 12 months and older. Do not use in breeding, pregnant, or nursing dogs. Tell your veterinarian if your dog has a serious infection, as this drug should not be used in these cases. Tell your veterinarian about all medications and supplements your dog takes, and do not give additional medications without discussing them with your veterinarian. It is unknown whether Apoquel\u00ae can be used with some other common allergy medications, including steroids and cyclosporine (Atopica\u00ae). Missed a Dose? If you miss a dose, you can give one when you remember and resume your dosing schedule. However, do not give a double dose. If the next dosage it due or close to being due, just skip the missed dose. Skipping doses may cause an increase in itching and skin inflammation.
