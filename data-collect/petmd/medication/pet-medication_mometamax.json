This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Mometamax\u00ae? Mometamax\u00ae is an otic suspension ear medication prescribed for the treatment of external ear infections in dogs caused by susceptible strains of yeast and certain bacteria. Mometamax\u00ae is only FDA approved in dogs but is often prescribed for cats and other pets off-label. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. How Mometamax\u00ae Works Mometamax\u00ae works by combining three separate ingredients (gentamycin, mometasone, clotrimazole) to treat susceptible ear infections. Gentamycin is an antibiotic that is active against several common strains of bacteria which can infect the ear. Mometasone is a steroid utilized to decrease inflammation in the ear canal and clotrimazole is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent that is used to treat common yeast organisms. Before using this product, it is important that your veterinarian examines your dog\u2019s eardrum to ensure that it is intact to avoid damage to the inner ear. Mometamax\u00ae Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Mometamax\u00ae ear drops are instilled directly into the infected ear canal once daily for 7 consecutive days. The number of drops to instill varies based on the pets&#039;s weight. Ensure that the external ear canal is thoroughly cleaned and dried before treatment. Missed a Dose? If you forget to administer a dose of Mometamax\u00ae, instill it when you remember. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses.
