Come to petMD for a complete list of pet medications and prescriptions.", "articleBody": "General Description Captopril is used to treat minor to severe heart failure and high blood pressure. It lowers blood pressure, lowers the stress on the heart, and reduces fluid build-up in the lungs. It is often used in conjunction with other drugs. It is best to give this drug on an empty stomach. If stopping use of this drug, consult your veterinarian for an effective gradual reduction in dosage. How It Works Captopril inhibits the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), an enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II acts as a potent vasoconstrictor, meaning it narrows the blood vessels. By inhibiting this enzyme, it prevents the angiotensin II from ever being created and relaxes the blood vessels. This lowers the blood pressure and reduces the amount of work the heart has to do. Storage Information Store in a tightly sealed container at room temperature. Missed Dose? If you miss a dose, give the dose as soon as possible. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose, and continue with the regular schedule. Do not give your pet two doses at once. \u00a0 Side Effects and Drug Reactions Captopril may result in these side effects:     Low blood pressure    Loss of appetite    Vomiting    Diarrhea    Rash    High blood pressure if medication is halted abruptlyCaptopril may react with these drugs:     Antacids    Diuretics    Rimadyl (and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)    Potassium sparing diuretics    Vasodilators    Cimetidine    Digoxin    Potassium chloride or gluconate"}]
