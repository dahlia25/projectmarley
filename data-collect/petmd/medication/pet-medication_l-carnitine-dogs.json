This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice from your vet. What Is L-Carnitine? L-carnitine is an essential amino acid (building block of protein) required for the metabolism of fat and energy and is a nutrient that helps promote normal heart and skeletal muscle function. L-carnitine, also known as levocarnitine, is a supplement that may be recommended by veterinarians to treat specific types of heart disease in dogs\u2014dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and cardiomyopathy caused by the anti-cancer medication doxorubicin. L-carnitine can be used as a solo medication, but it is more often used in combination with other medications for the management of heart disease. L-carnitine may also be used in combination with other medications to treat toxicities from valproic acid, a human anti-seizure medication that can cause liver toxicity in dogs. L-carnitine is also used to treat a rare genetic disorder in dogs, L-carnitine deficiency. Your veterinarian will determine which L-carnitine formulation and dosage is best for your dog based on their circumstances and symptoms. Make sure that the product you are giving your dog contains L-carnitine and not D-carnitine, which blocks L-carnitine from working. It is important to note that the actual amount of L-carnitine in a supplement labeled as carnitine can vary greatly. Additionally, a healthy dog does not need to take an L-carnitine supplement if they are already eating a high-quality AAFCO-approved food that is nutritionally complete and balanced with essential nutrients. L-carnitine is FDA-approved for human use in multiple prescription forms under the brand name Carnitor\u00ae and generic levocarnitine. It is also available as a prescription injection and in over-the-counter bulk powder formulations. L-carnitine is currently not FDA-approved as a veterinary medication. However, it is occasionally utilized in the veterinary field, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs in animals in certain circumstances. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. Your veterinarian will determine whether this medication is right for your dog. How L-Carnitine Works L-carnitine is an essential nutrient that plays a critical role in fat and energy metabolism. It works by moving fatty acids inside the cell, where they are converted to energy. The heart muscle and skeletal muscles are the most important locations where L-carnitine is stored and used. L-Carnitine Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. L-carnitine can be given with or without food, but giving it with food can decrease the risk of digestive upset. If using a powder form of this medicine, mix it into your dog\u2019s food as directed by your veterinarian. Use\u00a0L-carnitine; do not use any carnitine product that contains D-carnitine. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of L-carnitine. Generally, they may instruct you to give it when you remember, or if it is almost time for your pet\u2019s next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. L-Carnitine Possible Side Effects L-carnitine is typically well tolerated in dogs. Possible side effects are usually associated with high doses and may include: Diarrhea Nausea Vomiting Human Side Effects L-carnitine is also a medication for humans, frequently with dosages that are different from those prescribed for your pet by a veterinarian. Due to possible side effects, humans should never use medicine dispensed or recommended for their pets and pets should not be given any medicine dispensed for a human\u2019s use. If you accidentally ingest a pet medication, call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222. Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) Your pet\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of L-carnitine L-Carnitine Overdose Information Higher dosages of L-carnitine may cause diarrhea and gastrointestinal upset. Studies have not been performed to evaluate the potential toxicity of L-carnitine in animals. If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian, seek emergency veterinary care, or call an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply. Pet Poison Helpline (855) 764-7661 ASPCA Animal Poison Control (888) 426-4435 L-Carnitine Storage Levocarnitine formulations should be stored at controlled room temperature from 68 F\u201377 F. Always confirm storage requirements by reading the prescription label. Keep out of reach of children and pets."}]
