This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. \u00a0 What is Pyrantel Pamoate? Pyrantel pamoate is a common parasiticide used to treat intestinal parasites in puppies, dogs, horses, and other animals. This liquid medication helps to deworm pets against a few common parasites such as large roundworms and hookworms. Manufacturers also blend pyrantel pamoate with other types of antiparasitic medications that target a larger variety of internal parasites. As a component of several popular heartworm preventative medications, including Heartgard\u00ae Plus and Tri-Heart\u00ae Plus, many dogs safely receive pyrantel pamoate on a monthly basis.  How Pyrantel Pamoate Works Pyrantel pamoate treats large roundworms (Toxocara canis and Toxascaris leonina) and hookworms (Ancylostoma caninum and\u00a0Uncinaria stenocephala). The medication works by paralyzing worms, which are then expelled from the body in feces. Pyrantel only treats parasites found in the gastrointestinal tract because it does not absorb well into the bloodstream. Because these worms can be large enough to see without a microscope, you may see them in your dog\u2019s feces after treatment.\u00a0 Pyrantel Pamoate For Cats Pyrantel pamoate by itself is not FDA-approved in cats. However, it is readily utilized in the veterinary field, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs in animals in certain circumstances. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label Pyrantel pamoate can be found in combination products along with other deworming medications. For example, Drontal\u00ae, which is FDA approved for use in cats and kittens, contains pyrantel pamoate and praziquantel. Follow the directions on the drug label or as directed by your cat\u2019s veterinarian. Pyrantel Pamoate Directions Consult with your veterinarian to see if pyrantel is appropriate for your pet. Since pyrantel does not eliminate all types of worms or parasites, your veterinarian may perform a fecal test before treatment to pinpoint the type of parasite your dog has. A follow-up fecal test may also be necessary 2-4 weeks after treatment to confirm that the worms are gone. Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Liquid suspensions can separate; shake well before use. Most dogs like the taste of pyrantel and usually take the medication willingly. If not, the medication can be hidden in a small amount of food. Talk to your veterinarian about a deworming schedule that is appropriate for your pet, as dosing schedules vary for puppies, nursing dogs, and adult dogs. A single treatment can be effective, but it may need to be repeated as part of a deworming program. Several pyrantel pamoate products are available. The amount of pyrantel varies between the products. Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Consult your veterinarian for assistance in the diagnosing, treating, and controlling intestinal worms and other parasites. Pyrantel pamoate and other types of pyrantel (such as pyrantel tartrate) are available for use in horses and other species. These products contain much larger amounts of the drug and should not be used in dogs. Missed a Dose? If you forget a dose, give pyrantel pamoate when you remember. Follow-up testing for the presence of worms may need to be rescheduled. Consult with your veterinarian to determine the appropriate timing for these tests. Pyrantel Pamoate Possible Side Effects Pyrantel pamoate is considered a safe medication. Side effects are rare when given at doses recommended on the label. If seen, the following side effects may be due to the removal of the worms. VomitingDiarrheaDecreased appetiteHuman Side Effects While this medication is also used in human medicine there are different dosages and side effects that can occur in humans. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If you accidentally ingest this medication please call your physician or local poison control center. Monitoring No specific monitoring is required for this medication, but your veterinarian may recommend routine testing depending on your pets&#039; individual needs, other medications they may be on and/or the issue that initially caused your pet to be placed on this medication.
