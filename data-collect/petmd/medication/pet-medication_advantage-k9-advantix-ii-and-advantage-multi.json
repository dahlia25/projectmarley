This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Advantage\u00ae? Advantage\u00ae \u00a0is a series of medications used to treat and prevent flea infestations in cats and ferrets and fleas and lice in dogs. Advantage\u00ae is effective against adult fleas and flea larvae. It is available in several formulations (in combination with other medications) and strengths. Use only specific Advantage\u00ae products as advised by your veterinarian. \u00a0 Advantage Multi\u00ae includes the medication moxidectin, which adds heartworm, hookworm, and roundworm prevention to Advantage\u00ae for dogs and cats. Advantage Multi\u00ae for cats also provides protection against ear mites, while in dogs, Advantage Multi\u00ae also protects against whipworm and sarcoptic mange. It is available only by prescription. Talk to your vet about whether Advantage Multi\u00ae is right for your pet. Always read and follow all label instructions carefully. K9 Advantix\u00ae\u00a0II is used only in dogs to treat, prevent, and repel fleas, ticks, lice, mosquitoes, and biting flies. It contains permethrin, which is not safe for use in cats. These medications are dosed separately for dogs and cats and given by weight, so it is important to use the correct species and sized medication for your pet. Using cat medications on dogs or using dog medications on cats can cause serious problems, including lack of efficacy or an overdose.\u00a0 \u00a0 How Advantage\u00ae, K9 Advantix\u00ae II and Advantage Multi\u00ae Works The main ingredient in the Advantage line of products is imidacloprid, which works by blocking certain naturally occurring chemicals found in parasites that are responsible for sending nerve signals. Imidacloprid disrupts their central nervous system and causes death of the parasite. When used as a topical product, imidacloprid does not enter your pet\u2019s bloodstream. The second active ingredient in Advantage\u00ae and K9 Advantix\u00ae II products is pyriproxyfen, which mimics a growth hormone that naturally occurs in parasites. Pyriproxyfen targets young and immature parasites by preventing them from growing into adulthood. It can also prevent egg production in female insects. K9 Advantix\u00ae II also contains the ingredient permethrin, which works similarly to imidacloprid. Permethrin blocks certain chemical messengers in ticks and overwhelms their nervous system, causing paralysis and death. Permethrin is toxic to cats; K9 Advantix\u00ae\u00a0II should never be used in a cat. Cats should not be allowed around dogs treated with K9 Advantix\u00ae\u00a0II within the first 24 hours of application. Advantage Multi\u00ae products also contain the ingredient moxidectin, which shifts chloride, a naturally occurring electrolyte, across the cell membrane of certain susceptible worms such as heartworms, roundworms, and hookworms. By overloading chloride into these worms, it affects the electrical activity within their nervous system, causing muscle paralysis and death. Advantage\u00ae, K9 Advantix\u00ae II and Advantage Multi\u00ae Directions Follow the directions on the drug label of the species-specific product or as provided by your veterinarian. These topical products should be applied to the skin after the fur has been parted. In cats and ferrets, medication should be applied to one area at the base of the head. When using K9 Advantix\u00ae II, it is applied in 2-3 equal spots along the back, from the shoulders to the tail. Advantage Multi\u00ae is applied in 3-4 equal spots along the upper back to the base of the neck in areas where your pet is unable to lick. Missed a Dose? If you forget to give a dose of Advantage\u00ae, K9 Advantix\u00ae II, or Advantage Multi\u00ae, give it when you remember. Most of these medications are given once a month and the schedule should follow as close to 30 days as possible in between dosages.
