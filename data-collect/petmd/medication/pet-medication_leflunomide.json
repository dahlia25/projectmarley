This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Leflunomide? Leflunomide is a prescription immunosuppressant\u2014a medication that suppresses the immune system. In dogs, it is sometimes used to treat immune mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA), polyarthritis, or rheumatoid arthritis. It can also be used in combination with other medications to treat polyarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis in cats. Leflunomide is also used as an alternate or additional immunosuppressant in cats or dogs that are not responding to or are experiencing side effects from other immunosuppressant medications. How Leflunomide Works Leflunomide works by breaking down teriflunomide into its active form in the body. Teriflunomide addresses the overproduction of immune cells by specifically blocking the formation of DNA and RNA in replicating lymphocytes of the immune system that are responsible for swelling and inflammation. While leflunomide is FDA-approved for human use under the brand name Arava\u00ae and its generic name, leflunomide, it is currently not FDA-approved as a veterinary medication.\u00a0 However, it is readily utilized in the veterinary field, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs in animals in certain circumstances. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of leflunomide. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. Leflunomide Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Generally, leflunomide is given by mouth once daily with or without food. If digestive upset occurs when giving this medication on an empty stomach, speak with your veterinarian.

Speak with your veterinarian regarding specific dosage instructions for your pet, as they may reduce the dose over time based on your pet&#039;s response to this medication. Pregnant women and those who may become pregnant should avoid contact with this medication due to the risk of birth defects. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of leflunomide. Generally, they may instruct you to give it when you remember, or if it is almost time for your next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. Leflunomide Possible Side Effects Side effects are rare with this medication but may include: Diarrhea Lethargy Unexplained bleeding or bruising Blood in urine Liver irritation Vomiting Lack of appetite Difficulty breathing Coughing Rectal bleeding By suppressing the immune system, leflunomide can make your pet more susceptible to infections.
