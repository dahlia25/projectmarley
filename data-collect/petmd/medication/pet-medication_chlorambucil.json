This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Chlorambucil? Chlorambucil is a type of oral chemotherapy or anti-cancer (anti-neoplastic) drug that can be used alone or in combination with other medications to treat certain types of cancers. It treats leukemia in dogs and cats, as well as lymphoma in dogs, cats, horses and ferrets. Chlorambucil is also used as an immunosuppressant to treat certain immune mediated diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, immune mediate hemolytic anemia, and lupus. Chlorambucil is FDA-approved for human use under the brand name Leukeran\u00ae. Chlorambucil is currently not FDA approved as a veterinary medication. However, it is readily utilized in the veterinary field, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs for use in animals in certain circumstances. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. How Chlorambucil Works Chlorambucil works against cancerous cells as an alkylating agent. Alkylating agents bind to the DNA of cancerous cells and prevent them from replicating, which eventually causes death of those cells. Chlorambucil, like other types of antineoplastic agents, can affect more than just the cancer cells they are meant to target. In immune-mediated diseases, chlorambucil can also target an overactive immune system from attacking the body\u2019s own tissues and organs. Chlorambucil Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Since this is a chemotherapeutic agent, it should not be crushed or split and is best given with food. Your veterinarian will determine the appropriate dosage for your pet. Depending on your pet\u2019s condition, your veterinarian may provide instructions to administer this medication once every 24-72 hours, or even once every few. Missed a Dose? If you forget to give a dose of chlorambucil, contact your veterinarian to determine when you should resume your dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. If it is almost time for your next dose, your veterinarian may instruct you to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Chlorambucil Possible Side Effects The most common side effect of chlorambucil is suppression of the bone marrow (where new blood cells are made) which can cause low blood cell counts.
