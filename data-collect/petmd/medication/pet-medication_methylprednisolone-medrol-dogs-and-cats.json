Learn how methylprednisolone works, including possible side effects, directions, and more.", "articleBody": "PetMD\u2019s medications content was written and reviewed by veterinary professionals to answer your most common questions about how medications function, their side effects, and what species they are prescribed for. This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Methylprednisolone? Methylprednisolone is an FDA-approved prescription glucocorticoid (steroid) used to treat a variety of medical conditions, including seasonal allergies (atopic dermatitis) and hypersensitivities in dogs and cats. As a glucocorticoid replacement, methylprednisolone can also be a lifesaving emergency treatment for a serious condition in dogs with dangerously low levels of cortisol, a condition known as Addison\u2019s disease. Methylprednisolone can also be used as an immunosuppressive medication to treat inflammatory diseases and has a role in anti-cancer (chemotherapy) regimens. Methylprednisolone is available in multiple formulations, including the brand name Medrol\u00ae and as generic methylprednisolone. The injectable forms of methylprednisolone, either fast-acting (methylprednisolone sodium succinate) or sustained release, which are slowly absorbed and last weeks to months (methylprednisolone acetate), are administered in the hospital by your veterinarian. Methylprednisolone is intended to be given to your pet for the shortest amount of time at the lowest dose needed to help relieve your pet\u2019s symptoms. Your veterinarian will determine the best course of treatment for your pet. In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded oral formulation of methylprednisolone. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug, such as if your pet has trouble taking pills in capsule form, the dosage strength is not commercially available, or the pet is allergic to an ingredient in the FDA-approved medication. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here. Methylprednisolone Considerations It is important to note that methylprednisolone can weaken the immune system, which may make it more challenging for a sick pet to fight off an infection. Methylprednisolone should not be used in pets with certain medical conditions, such as fungal infections, viral infections, stomach ulcer, corneal ulcer, overactive adrenal gland disease (Cushing\u2019s syndrome), tuberculosis, or in pets that are hypersensitive to the medication. This is why it\u2019s important to discuss your pet\u2019s entire medical history with your veterinarian. Methylprednisolone should be used cautiously in pets with diabetes, osteoporosis, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, kidney disease, or blood clotting conditions. Giving methylprednisolone with certain medications can result in health risks to your pet, so it is important to discuss your pet\u2019s medications and medical conditions with your veterinarian. How Methylprednisolone Works Methylprednisolone can have various effects on the body depending on the dose and treatment regimen. At lower doses, it can reduce inflammation and have broad anti-inflammatory effects. At higher doses it can suppress the immune system, which may be helpful in treating certain forms of cancer. Methylprednisolone is also used to help pets with Addison\u2019s disease replenish dangerously low cortisol levels. Methylprednisolone is considered a much stronger steroid than over-the-counter cortisone medication, and it is also commonly used to aid in certain emergencies such as severe allergic reactions. Your veterinarian will prescribe a dose and regimen that is appropriate for your pet\u2019s medical condition. Methylprednisolone Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Methylprednisolone is best given with food to lower the risk of digestive upset. Ensure your pet has access to plenty of water. If your veterinarian recommends that you discontinue this medication for your pet for any reason, they will generally wean your pet off slowly, under their supervision, especially if your pet has been taking the medication long-term. Methylprednisolone stays in your pet\u2019s bloodstream after your pet stops receiving it, so you may notice its effects continuing for several days after their last dosage. Do not stop this medication abruptly without a veterinarian\u2019s guidance, as serious side effects may occur. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of methylprednisolone. Generally, they may instruct you to give it when you remember, or if it is almost time for your pet\u2019s next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. Methylprednisolone Possible Side Effects Methylprednisolone is generally well tolerated. Common side effects may include: Increased thirst Increased urination Increased appetite Other more severe side effects may be seen with higher dosages and long-term therapy: Weight gain Panting Vomiting Diarrhea Ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract Thinning skin Dull/dry haircoat with hair loss Elevated liver levels Inflammation of the pancreas Abnormal blood clotting Worsening of diabetes mellitus Decreased muscle mass Pot-bellied appearance Behavior changes (depression, low energy, aggression) Corticosteroids administered orally or by injection to pregnant animals may induce premature birth. Additionally, this medication has resulted in birth defects when used in pregnant pets. Be sure to inform your veterinarian if your pet is breeding or pregnant. Human Side Effects Methylprednisolone is also a prescription medication for humans, frequently with dosages that are different from those prescribed for your pet by a veterinarian. Due to possible side effects, humans should never use medicine dispensed for their pets and pets should not be given any medicine dispensed for a human\u2019s use. If you have hypersensitivity to glucocorticoids, talk to your veterinarian about using another medication, or ensure that you wear gloves while in contact with this medication. Wash your hands after application. If you accidentally ingest this medication, call your physician, seek medical attention, or call the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222. Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) Your pet\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of methylprednisolone Methylprednisolone Overdose Information Overdoses of methylprednisolone can cause severe vomiting, diarrhea, or gastrointestinal upset. Prolonged use or overdosage may suppress your pet\u2019s immune system, which can cause dangerous side effects if the medication is stopped abruptly. If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian, seek emergency veterinary care, or call an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply. Pet Poison Helpline (855) 764-7661 ASPCA Animal Poison Control (888) 426-4435 Methylprednisolone Storage Methylprednisolone tablets should be stored at controlled room temperatures of 68 F to 77 F.
