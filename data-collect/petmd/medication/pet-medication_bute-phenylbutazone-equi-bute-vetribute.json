It blocks the body\u2019s COX- 2 pathway, which lowers the production of natural chemicals that trigger inflammation, thereby reducing fever and offering pain relief.

Your veterinarian will determine the appropriate\u00a0dosage based the animal\u2019s weight, condition, and other medications they may be prescribed. When given by mouth, Bute is usually given once or twice daily with food. Note, when administering oral paste, your animal\u2019s mouth should be empty. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of Bute.
