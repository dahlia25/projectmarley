This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What Is Codeine? Codeine is a human prescription narcotic that can be used in pets to relieve pain and suppress coughing in dogs. Codeine blocks pain but does not treat the underlying cause of pain in dogs. Compared to other medications for pain relief and cough suppression, codeine\u2019s absorption in the body is less predictable and it is poorly absorbed in dogs. Due to these considerations, many veterinarians choose other FDA-approved medications for veterinary use that work better than codeine. Codeine is never used in cats because many codeine formulations contain acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol\u00ae that is highly toxic to cats. Codeine is FDA-approved for human use in various tablet and syrup formulations, including generic tablets and prescription combination products with acetaminophen (the active ingredient in Tylenol), promethazine, and other medications. Codeine is currently not FDA- approved as a veterinary medication. However, veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs in animals in certain circumstances. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. Codeine Considerations Codeine should not be used for pets with certain medical conditions, such as severe respiratory disease, hypothyroidism, kidney disease, liver disease, Addison\u2019s disease, head trauma, seizures, and certain gastrointestinal conditions, and it should not be used for pets who are severely debilitated. Giving codeine with certain medications can result in health risks to your pet, so it is important to discuss your pet\u2019s medications and medical conditions with your veterinarian. Codeine is classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a controlled substance. As such, this may affect the prescribing, dispensing, and refilling of this medication due to federal and state law. Likewise, it is illegal for you to consume, sell, or give away your pet\u2019s codeine. How Codeine Works Codeine is classified as an opioid narcotic pain reliever. It specifically binds to opioid pain receptors in the nervous system, which blocks pain signals from communicating with the brain, thereby preventing the dog from feeling pain. Codeine also suppresses the cough reflex in the cough center of the brain. Codeine Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Generally, your veterinarian will recommend that codeine be given with food to decrease the risk of digestive upset. If your veterinarian recommends that you discontinue codeine in your dog for any reason, it is important to closely follow your veterinarian\u2019s recommendations on how to wean your dog off this medication. Abruptly stopping codeine after a long period of your dog taking it can cause them to experience withdrawal symptoms. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of codeine. Generally, they may instruct you to give it when you remember, or if it is almost time for your pet\u2019s next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. Do not give extra or double doses. Codeine Possible Side Effects Codeine is typically well-tolerated in most dogs. Possible side effects include: Grogginess Gastrointestinal signs such as constipation, loss of appetite, or vomiting Decreased breathing rate with high doses or repeated use Human Side Effects Codeine is also a prescription medication for humans, frequently with dosages different from those prescribed for your pet by a veterinarian. Due to possible side effects, pets should not be given any medicine prescribed for humans. If you accidentally ingest a pet medication, call your physician or the national Poison Control Center hotline at 800-222-1222. Call Your Vet If: Severe side effects are seen (see above) Your pet\u2019s condition worsens or does not improve with treatment You see or suspect an overdose You have additional questions or concerns about the use of codeine Codeine Overdose Information Overdoses of codeine can be life-threatening. Symptoms of an overdose may include sedation, severely decreased breathing rate, collapse, abnormally low body temperature, and muscle weakness. If you suspect an overdose, immediately contact your veterinarian, seek emergency veterinary care, or call an animal poison control center. Consultation fees often apply.
