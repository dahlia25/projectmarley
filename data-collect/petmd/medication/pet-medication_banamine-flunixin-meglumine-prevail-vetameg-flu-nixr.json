This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Banamine\u00ae? Banamine\u00ae is an FDA approved non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) prescription medication. It is available in a paste form or as an injection. In horses, Banamine\u00ae is FDA approved for the alleviation of inflammation and pain associated with musculoskeletal disorders, as well as alleviation of visceral pain associated with colic. In cattle, flunixin is FDA approved as indicated for the control of pyrexia associated with bovine respiratory disease, endotoxemia and acute bovine mastitis, as well as for the control of inflammation in endotoxemia. Flunixin is also used off-label in other species (like goats, ferrets, and rabbits) in the treatment of various illnesses. The term off-or extra- label use means that a medication is used in a way, or in a particular species, that are is specified on the medication label. How Banamine\u00ae Works Flunixin is a non-selective NSAID. It blocks the body\u2019s COX- 2 pathway, which lowers the production of natural chemicals that trigger inflammation, thereby reducing fever and offer pain relief. Due to its non-selective property, flunixin also blocks the COX-1 pathway which causes the side effects associated with digestion, kidney health, and clotting. Banamine\u00ae Directions Follow the directions on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Dosing varies greatly by species and the disease process for which the medication is being used. Directions will also vary based on the route you have been instructed to give this medication. While the injectable version of Banamine\u00ae is labeled for intravenous (IV) or intramuscular usage (IM), IM usage can cause clostridial myositis (see side effects section for more information) and is not recommended despite this route being on the drug label. In horses, the paste form of flunixin, such as Banamine\u00ae paste, is generally given orally once daily or the total dose can be divided and given twice daily. The dose is based on a horse&#039;s weight and is generally recommended for a maximum of 5 days in a row. When using Banamine\u00ae in dairy cows or beef cows a withdrawal period is needed after use of this medication. The withdrawal period for milk is 36 hours and for slaughter is four days. Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of flunixin. Generally, they will advise you to give it when you remember or, if it is almost time for your next dose, to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule. In most cases, do not give extra or double doses. Banamine\u00ae Possible Side Effects Most animals tolerate the use of flunixin well. If your animal has been given an injection of this medication into the muscle, monitor the injection site for: Swelling Redness Stiffness Wound formation A rare side effects in horses include a condition called clostridial myositis. This occurs when a type of bacteria called Clostridia grow on damaged muscle caused by the injection. Intramuscular administration of flunixin is not typically preferred in horses because a Clostridia infection can cause muscle inflammation and release toxins into the body, which can be life threatening. Intramuscular administration of flunixin is not permitted for use in animals intended for human consumption. Patients treated with this medication for long periods of time are at an increased risk for: Stomach ulcers Colonic ulcers Kidney damage This medication should not be given into an artery. Injection into an artery may cause: Incoordination Difficulty walking/stumbling Increased breathing rate Muscle weakness Hysteria Seizure or death if a horse has a traumatic backward flip or fall It is important to note that if your animal does not respond to the first dose of flunixin, then it is not likely to control their pain or symptoms. Speak with your veterinarian to discuss other options if your animal is not showing improvement on this medication. If you believe your animal may be experiencing any side effects, consult your veterinarian.\u00a0 Human Side Effects Banamine\u00ae is not intended for use in humans.
