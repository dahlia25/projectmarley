Interceptor\u00ae is a monthly medication for the prevention of heartworms in dogs and cats, containing the active ingredient milbemycin oxime. In dogs, Interceptor\u00ae also controls hookworms, and treats and controls roundworms, and whipworms.

Interceptor\u00ae is intended for cats and kittens weighing more than 1.5 pounds and older than 6 weeks of age. What is Interceptor\u00ae Plus? Interceptor\u00ae Plus contains two active ingredients, milbemycin oxime and praziquantel. Interceptor\u00ae Plus works to prevent heartworm disease, and to treat and control hookworms, roundworms, whipworms and tapeworms. Interceptor\u00ae Plus is intended for dogs and puppies weighing more than 2 pounds and older than 6 weeks of age. How Interceptor\u00ae and Interceptor\u00ae Plus Works The main active ingredient in both Interceptor\u00ae and Interceptor\u00ae Plus is milbemycin oxime. Milbemycin shifts chloride, a naturally occurring electrolyte, across the cell membrane of certain susceptible worms such as heartworms, roundworms, and hookworms. By overloading chloride into these worms, it affects the electrical activity within their nervous system, causing muscle paralysis and death. Praziquantel is the second active ingredient in Interceptor\u00ae Plus, which adds protection against tapeworms. The way praziquantel works against intestinal parasites is unclear, but it is believed to interfere with the worms&#039; muscle integrity and cause paralysis.
