This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Simparica\u00ae? Simparica\u00ae contains the active ingredient sarolaner, and is available as an oral chewable tablet used to treat and prevent fleas and certain ticks in dogs. It is also labeled for the treatment and prevention of the Gulf Coast tick, American dog tick, black-legged tick, lone star tick, and brown dog tick. Simparica\u00ae is approved for dogs and puppies weighing more than 2.8 pounds and over 6 months of age. Simparica\u00ae is also used in an extra-label capacity to treat demodectic mange, sarcoptic mange, and ear mites in dogs. The term off-label or extra-label use means that a medication is used in a way or in a particular species that is not specified on the medication label. While veterinarians often prescribe medications for off-label uses, your veterinarian will determine whether Simparica\u00ae is right for your pet. What Is Simparica Trio\u00ae? Simparica Trio\u00ae contains two additional active ingredients, moxidectin and pyrantel. Simparica Trio\u00ae works to prevent heartworm disease, treat and prevent flea infestations, treat and control tick infestations, and treat and control roundworms and hookworms. Simparica Trio\u00ae is intended for dogs and puppies weighing more than 2.8 pounds and older than 8 weeks of age. How Simparica\u00ae &amp; Simparica Trio\u00ae Works The active ingredient of Simparica\u00ae, sarolaner, belongs to a newer class of flea and tick preventatives called isoxazolines. Sarolaner is ingested by fleas and ticks when they bite, and works by over-exciting their nervous system, causing paralysis and death. This medication works within the first few hours after administration to kill fleas present on your dog, and is dosed by weight, so it is important to use the correct-sized medication for your pet. Weighing your dog regularly will ensure that you are using the correct product size. \u00a0 Simparica Trio\u00ae also contains the ingredient moxidectin, which shifts chloride, a naturally occurring electrolyte, across the cell membrane of certain susceptible worms such as heartworms, roundworms, and hookworms. By overloading chloride into these worms, it affects the electrical activity within their nervous system, causing muscle paralysis and death. The third ingredient in Simparica Trio\u00ae is pyrantel. Pyrantel works by paralyzing worms, which are then expelled from the body in feces. Pyrantel only treats parasites found in the gastrointestinal tract because it does not absorb well into the bloodstream.
