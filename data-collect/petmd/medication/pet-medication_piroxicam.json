This content shouldn\u2019t take the place of advice by your vet. What is Piroxicam? Piroxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-tumor activity. It is most often prescribed by veterinarians for cancer treatment in animals. \u00a0 Veterinarians commonly prescribe piroxicam to treat a type of bladder cancer called transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) in dogs and cats. Piroxicam can also help treat other types of cancer, including mammary (breast) tumors, lung tumors, and squamous cell carcinoma. \u00a0 Piroxicam is FDA-approved for use in humans under the brand name Feldene\u00ae. Piroxicam is currently not FDA approved as a veterinary medication. However, it is readily utilized in the veterinary field as an anti-cancer treatment, and veterinarians can legally prescribe certain human drugs for use in animals in certain circumstances. This is called extra-label or off-label use because this use isn\u2019t described on the drug label. In certain circumstances, your vet may recommend a compounded formulation of piroxicam. Compounded medications are prescribed if there\u2019s a specific reason your pet\u2019s health can\u2019t be managed by an FDA-approved drug. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved. They are created by either a veterinarian or a licensed pharmacist on an individual basis to best suit a patient\u2019s particular needs. You can learn more about compounded medications here.\u00a0 How Piroxicam Works Veterinarians primarily prescribe piroxicam for its anti-tumor effects. The exact way that piroxicam works against tumors is unknown, but it appears to treat cancer in several ways.\u00a0Piroxicam acts on the immune system by helping it identify and kill cancer cells. Piroxicam, like other NSAIDs, works by inhibiting an enzyme called cyclooxygenase, or COX, which produces pro-inflammatory chemicals. Suppressing COX activity reduces inflammation that is caused by tumor cells. Piroxicam appears to also inhibit blood vessel growth in tumors. \u00a0\u00a0 Piroxicam Directions Follow directions closely as provided on the drug label or as provided by your veterinarian. Your veterinarian will determine the appropriate dosage based on your pet\u2019s weight and condition. This medicine is commonly given every 24-48 hours, but your veterinarian may recommend a different schedule. Do not give this medication more often or in a larger amount than prescribed without first speaking to your veterinarian.\u00a0 Although piroxicam can be given with or without food, it is usually best to give it with a meal to minimize any potential stomach upset. Give piroxicam for as long as your veterinarian recommends.\u00a0 Missed a Dose? Speak with your veterinarian about what to do if you forget to give a dose of piroxicam. Generally, they may advise you to give it when you remember. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, your veterinarian may instruct you to skip the missed dose and resume your normal dosing schedule.. In most cases, your veterinarian may instruct you to not give extra or double doses.\u00a0\u00a0 Piroxicam Possible Side Effects When giving your pet piroxicam, it is important to watch for side effects, especially signs of stomach or intestinal bleeding.
