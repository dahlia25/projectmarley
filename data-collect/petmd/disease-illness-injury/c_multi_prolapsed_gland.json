Including symptoms, treatment options, and preventative care.", "articleBody": "What is Eyelid Protrusion (Cherry Eye) in Dogs? Cherry eye is the common name for prolapsed gland of the third eyelid, meaning the gland has moved (prolapsed) out of its proper position. While humans only have two eyelids, dogs have three. Their third eyelid is located in the lower inner corner of the eye (close to the muzzle). This eyelid is made of conjunctiva (a thin, protective membrane), a T-shaped cartilage (firm connective tissue), and a lacrimal gland (tear gland). The tear gland is located at the bottom of the cartilage and cannot typically be seen.\u00a0\u00a0 In some dogs, the T-shaped cartilage flips upside-down, exposing (prolapsing) the third eyelid gland. When exposed, the gland often appears like a red or pink mass in the lower inside corner of the eye\u2014this is where the term \u201ccherry eye\u201d comes from.\u00a0 Certain dog breeds are more predisposed to cherry eye than others. Researchers aren\u2019t sure exactly why, but there is likely a genetic component. It is suspected that the connective tissues that hold the gland in place are not as strong as they should be in these particular breeds.\u00a0 Some of the most commonly affected breeds include:\u00a0\u00a0 Cocker Spaniel (American Cocker Spaniel)\u00a0 Beagle\u00a0 Bulldog (English Bulldog, British Bulldog)\u00a0 French Bulldog\u00a0\u00a0 Chinese Shar-Pei\u00a0 Newfoundland\u00a0 Neapolitan Mastiff\u00a0 Great Dane\u00a0 Lhasa Apso\u00a0 Cane Corso\u00a0 Bloodhound\u00a0 Shih Tzu\u00a0 Boston Terrier\u00a0 Pekingese\u00a0 Symptoms of Eyelid Protrusion (Cherry Eye) in Dogs The hallmark sign of cherry eye is a round, red or pink mass in the lower inner corner of the eye that looks like a cherry pit. This disease can affect either one eye or both eyes.\u00a0\u00a0 Symptoms of cherry eye that may be noticed at home include:\u00a0\u00a0 Red mass in the inner corner of the eye\u00a0 Discharge from the eye\u00a0 Redness of the eye\u00a0 Inflammation and redness of the conjunctiva\u00a0 Pawing at the eye or rubbing the face on various surface (to scratch the eye), these signs indicate that the eye is uncomfortable and another issue is occurring secondary to cherry eye\u00a0 It is important to note that prolapse of the third eyelid gland is not painful. However, cherry eye can lead to secondary issues, such as ulcers of the cornea (the eye\u2019s clear, protective outer layer) and chronic dry eye (not enough tears), which can be uncomfortable.\u00a0\u00a0 Causes of Eyelid Protrusion (Cherry Eye) in Dogs It is still unknown what causes cherry eye in dogs. It is suspected that in certain breeds, the connective tissues that hold the third eyelid gland in place are weaker, predisposing them to cherry eye.\u00a0\u00a0 It also suspected that in giant breed dogs, their large orbit (eye socket) has more room and flexibility, making the eyelid more likely to prolapse.\u00a0\u00a0 Conversely, in small breed dogs, their orbit (eye socket) may be too small for the eye, and the lack of space for both the eye and the gland of the third eyelid may predispose them to cherry eye.\u00a0\u00a0 However, these are only theories as to why cherry eye occurs more frequently in certain breeds, as the true cause is still unknown.\u00a0\u00a0 Treatment of Eyelid Protrusion (Cherry Eye) in Dogs Cherry eye in dogs is typically treated with surgery and post-surgical medication. Your veterinarian will be able to determine the best course of action based on your pet\u2019s diagnosis.\u00a0 Surgical Treatment If left untreated, cherry eye can cause secondary issues in the dogs\u2019 eyes. For this reason, surgery is recommended to place the gland back in the proper position. Surgery, generally, also prevents the disease from recurring.\u00a0\u00a0 There are several surgical techniques that are effective. The specific technique used depends on the surgeon\u2019s experience and preference.\u00a0\u00a0 Medication (post-surgery) After surgery, a dog will likely be placed on a few medications. The first is a topical eye antibiotic to prevent infections at the surgical site, as an infection could cause the surgery to fail.\u00a0\u00a0 The pain from the procedure typically comes from inflammation. As such, an oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) will likely be given for inflammation and pain.\u00a0\u00a0 It is essential to keep an Elizabethan collar (e-collar) on your pet while the surgical incisions are healing. This will prevent the dog from scratching at the incisions, which could potentially cause the surgery to fail.\u00a0 Recovery and Management of Eyelid Protrusion (Cherry Eye) in Dogs In general, unless complications occur, most dogs are rechecked about 2-4 weeks after surgery. At this time a Schirmer tear test will be performed to check for dry eye, as that is the most common secondary condition to occur in pets with cherry eye. The Schirmer tear test will measure the amount of tears produced to determine whether a pet has dry eye.\u00a0 The third eyelid gland is responsible for producing approximately 33% of a dog\u2019s tears. When the gland prolapses it may become damaged, predisposing the pet to chronic dry eye (keratoconjunctivitis sicca or KCS), even after the gland is repositioned. This is why it\u2019s critical to monitor tear production throughout the pet\u2019s life. If tear production is normal at the time of recheck, the Schirmer tear test will likely be done as an annual follow up."}]
