It occurs when the adrenal glands are triggered to produce an excessive amount of cortisone which hampers the metabolic process. This leads to gastrointestinal disorders and skin disease and hypertension Cushing's disease is most often caused by an increasing cortisone due to a benign tumor of the pituitary gland the gland that controls all hormone production in the body. The disease generally affects middle age to older pets.\n\nThere are several symptoms that may indicate Cushing's disease in dogs. These include increased thirst and hunger increased urination increased panting muscle weakness obesity, lack of energy inability to sleep and a pot-bellied handyman. Other symptoms may include hair loss darkening of the skin white scaly patches on the skin or even bruising. Your veterinarian will run tests to measure cortisone levels in your dog's bloodstream to determine if your dog has Cushing's disease.\n\nMost dogs can be treated with drugs that will vary depending on the severity of symptoms. These drugs may have serious side effects. So dogs taking them should be closely monitored. Pet parents should be aware that dogs diagnosed with Cushing's disease require lifelong medication and care for frequent veterinary follow UPS are recommended to monitor your dog's health.", "potentialAction": {"@type": "SeekToAction", "target": "https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/endocrine/cushings-disease-dogs?wtime={seek_to_second_number}", "startOffset-input": "required name=seek_to_second_number"}}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "BreadcrumbList", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 0, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.petmd.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Diseases A-Z", "item": "https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "Article", "headline": "Cushing&#039;s Disease in Dogs", "inLanguage": "en-US", "isFamilyFriendly": "True", "isAccessibleForFree": "True", "articleSection": "Endocrine", "thumbnailUrl": "https://image.petmd.com/files/styles/863x625/public/2023-02/iStock-1216439282.jpg", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://image.petmd.com/files/styles/863x625/public/2023-02/iStock-1216439282.jpg"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Krista Seraydar, DVM", "url": "https://www.petmd.com/author/dr-krista-seraydar"}, "keywords": "Dog, Symptom Checker, Cushing&#039;s Disease", "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "PetMD", "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.petmd.com/images/petmd_logo.png"}, "url": "https://www.petmd.com"}, "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/endocrine/cushings-disease-dogs"}, "datePublished": "October 29, 2020", "dateModified": "October 6, 2023", "description": "What is Cushing\u2019s Disease and how can it affect your dog? Dr. Krista Seraydar explains the symptoms, causes and how it\u2019s treated.", "articleBody": "Cushing\u2019s disease\u2014also known as hypercortisolism and hyperadrenocorticism\u2014is a serious disease that typically affects middle-aged and senior dogs. It can be serious if left untreated. Here\u2019s what you need to know about Cushing\u2019s disease in dogs\u2014from types and symptoms to treatment and care. What Is Cushing&#039;s Disease in Dogs? Cushing\u2019s disease (hyperadrenocorticism) usually occurs when the adrenal gland secretes too much stress hormone, or cortisol. What Causes Cushing&#039;s Disease in Dogs? Cushing\u2019s disease in dogs is most commonly seen in middle-aged to older dogs\u2014from about 7\u201312 years old. There are three types of Cushing\u2019s Disease in dogs: Pituitary-Dependent Cushing\u2019s Disease Pituitary-dependent Cushing\u2019s disease occurs when a tumor of the pituitary gland at the base of the brain secretes too much of the hormone that stimulates the adrenal gland to make cortisol. These tumors are typically benign and small; however,\u00a015\u201320% of dogs with pituitary tumors will eventually develop neurologic signs as the tumor grows. Pituitary tumors are responsible for\u00a080\u201385% of Cushing\u2019s disease cases. Adrenal Gland Tumor The adrenal glands create stress hormones and are located next to the kidneys. An adrenal gland tumor can be benign (not cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Adrenal tumors cause\u00a015\u201320% of Cushing\u2019s disease cases. Iatrogenic Cushing\u2019s Disease Iatrogenic Cushing\u2019s disease in dogs is caused by excessive or long-term use of corticosteroid medications. What Does Cushing&#039;s Disease Do to Dogs? While not inherently painful, Cushing\u2019s\u00a0disease in dogs (especially if uncontrolled) can be associated with: High blood pressure Bladder stones Diabetes Chronic skin and urinary tract infections Changes in the liver (vacuolar hepatopathy) Increased risk of blood clots High blood pressure and protein loss through the urine are also common with hyperadrenocorticism and can contribute to kidney disease. Additionally,\u00a015\u201320% of dogs with pituitary tumors develop neurologic signs as the tumor grows and\u00a05\u201310% of dogs with Cushing\u2019s will also develop diabetes. Although rare, Cushing\u2019s patients are also at risk for\u00a0pulmonary thromboembolisms (potentially fatal blood clots in the lungs). Are Certain Breeds Predisposed to Cushing\u2019s Disease?  Any dog can develop Cushing\u2019s disease, but it is more commonly diagnosed in these breeds: Poodles, especially\u00a0Miniature Poodles Dachshunds Boxers Boston Terriers Yorkshire Terriers American Staffordshire Terriers What Are the Symptoms of Cushing&#039;s Disease in Dogs? There are a variety of symptoms that can appear in a dog with Cushing\u2019s disease. Some of the most common signs include: Drinking more water Increased urination Increased appetite Hair loss or poor regrowth Panting Pot-belly appearance Thin skin Blackheads Recurrent skin infections Recurrent urinary infections Sudden blindness Lethargy Urinary incontinence Seborrhea or oily skin Firm, irregular plaques on skin (called calcinosis cutis) How Is Cushing&#039;s Disease Diagnosed in Dogs? Although there is no single test that will diagnose 100% of cases, your veterinarian will likely recommend some combination of the following: Baseline bloodwork (CBC/Chemistry) Urinalysis +/- urine culture (to rule out urinary tract infections) ACTH stimulation test (can have false negatives) Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (can be affected by other illnesses) High-dose dexamethasone suppression test Urine cortisol to creatinine ratio\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Abdominal\u00a0ultrasound\u00a0(can identify changes in liver and adrenal gland enlargement or tumors) Computerized tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (can detect pituitary tumors) What&#039;s the Treatment for Cushing&#039;s Disease in Dogs?  Treating Cushing\u2019s disease in dogs is largely dependent on the underlying cause. Treatment options include: Surgery Medication Radiation If Cushing\u2019s disease is caused by the excessive use of steroids, the steroid dosage should be gradually tapered down and discontinued, if possible. But take note: This may result in relapse of the primary disease the steroid was originally used to treat so different medications may be needed. Surgery Adrenal tumors can often be surgically removed. And, if they are benign, surgery can be curative. Because of their location at the base of the brain, pituitary tumors are harder to remove. Surgery for pituitary tumors may be available at some referral veterinary hospitals. Medication Medical management with either\u00a0trilostane\u00a0(Vetoryl\u00ae) or mitotane (Lysodren\u00ae)\u00a0is the most common form of treatment for pituitary tumors and when surgery isn\u2019t an option for an adrenal tumor. These drugs interfere with the production of cortisol, but very close monitoring is necessary to ensure that adrenal function is not impaired too much too quickly. Depending on which medication is started, your veterinarian will create a plan for monitoring your dog\u2019s bloodwork and reaching an appropriate dose (this will vary depending on patient, length of time on medication, etc.). Once the vet has determined your dog\u2019s proper dosage, an ACTH stimulation test is usually done every\u00a0three to six\u00a0months or if you notice signs of Cushing\u2019s beginning\u00a0to develop again. As pituitary and adrenal tumors progress, they will require an increased dose of medication to control symptoms. While starting medication or changing dosages, please be sure to monitor your pet for lethargy, vomiting, decreased appetite, or trouble breathing. Call your veterinarian immediately if any of these signs are noted. Radiation Radiation treatment for pituitary-dependent Cushing&#039;s disease in dogs has been shown to improve or eliminate neurological symptoms and improve the prognosis, especially when treated early. The median survival time in these cases is 743 days, or about two years. Radiation therapy may also be an option for adrenal tumors that cannot be surgically removed. How Long Do Dogs with Cushing&#039;s Disease Live? The prognosis for dogs with Cushing\u2019s disease depends on whether they have pituitary versus non-pituitary-dependent Cushing&#039;s, whether the tumor is benign or malignant, and on other specifics of the dog\u2019s case. Pituitary Tumors If caused by a small pituitary tumor, medical management can provide long-term control with good quality of life. For pituitary-dependent Cushing\u2019s disease, the median survival time of patients treated with trilostane or mitotane is about two to two and a half years. If a pituitary tumor is large and affects the brain and surrounding structures, the prognosis is poorer. Adrenal Tumors Approximately 50% of adrenal tumors are benign, and surgical removal can be curative. The other 50% of adrenal tumors are\u00a0malignant and carry a poor prognosis, especially if they have already metastasized at the time of diagnosis. The median survival time is approximately one year when treated with\u00a0trilostane or mitotane. The prognosis is worse in patients with metastasis of the primary tumor, local invasion of the vessels, or a tumor greater than 5 cm in length. Can You Prevent Cushing&#039;s Disease in Dogs? Unfortunately, you cannot prevent Cushing\u2019s disease if it is caused by a pituitary or adrenal gland tumor. However, you can avoid long-term use of high-dose steroids\u00a0to minimize the risk of developing iatrogenic Cushing\u2019s disease. Featured Image: iStock.com/devonanne"}]
