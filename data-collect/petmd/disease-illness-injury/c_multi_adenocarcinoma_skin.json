Dogs have two types of sweat glands: apocrine and eccrine. Apocrine sweat glands: These are located at the base of hair\u00a0follicles\u00a0all over the dog\u2019s body. Although they are considered a type of sweat gland,\u00a0apocrine\u00a0glands don\u2019t actually produce sweat. Instead, they\u00a0produce a thick fluid loaded with pheromones that help dogs identify each other by scent.\u00a0 Eccrine (or\u00a0merocrine) sweat glands:\u00a0These are similar to the sweat\u00a0glands\u00a0humans have that produce a clear, odorless fluid and helps cool us off. In dogs, eccrine glands are located in the paws, meaning that dogs \u201csweat\u201d from their paws. However, sweating is not the primary way dogs cool off (that\u2019s panting), and dogs have far fewer eccrine glands than humans. Additionally, dogs have another\u00a0type of\u00a0skin\u00a0gland called a sebaceous gland, which\u00a0is also located near the hair\u00a0follicle.\u00a0Sebaceous\u00a0glands are sometimes called oil glands and secrete an oily fluid called sebum that helps moisturize and protect your dog\u2019s skin and coat.\u00a0 An adenocarcinoma is type of malignant tumor that occurs in\u00a0the dog\u2019s\u00a0skin, including\u00a0sweat glands and the\u00a0sebaceous glands.\u00a0Adenocarcinomas in the eccrine glands in\u00a0dog\u00a0paws are extremely rare. Instead, the vast majority of these tumors occur in the\u00a0skin.\u00a0\u00a0 Adenocarcinomas in dogs\u00a0commonly\u00a0look like\u00a0raised, irregularly shaped masses, but they may also look like a skin ulcer or sore. They can appear anywhere on the\u00a0body, but\u00a0are most commonly found in a dog\u2019s \u201carmpit\u201d where their legs meet their bodies and in the groin area. They are most common in mixed-breed dogs, as well as large breeds including German Shepherds and Norwegian Elkhounds.\u00a0 Symptoms of Sweat Gland or Sebaceous Adenocarcinoma in Dogs The most common symptom of a sweat gland, sebaceous adenocarcinoma is a bump, or mass, on the skin that develops quickly and may grow rapidly.\u00a0These\u00a0masses are\u00a0usually\u00a0irregular\u00a0in\u00a0shape,\u00a0are firm,\u00a0and may be the same color of your dog\u2019s skin or another color. They are usually not painful when touched but may occasionally bleed or ooze. Causes of Sweat Gland or Sebaceous Adenocarcinoma in Dogs There are no known causes of\u00a0sebaceous\u00a0in dogs.\u00a0However, they\u00a0often\u00a0occur\u00a0more\u00a0frequently\u00a0in older animals and\u00a0some breeds are\u00a0predisposed\u00a0to developing sweat gland sebaceous adenocarcinoma. How Veterinarians Diagnose Sweat Gland, Sebaceous Adenocarcinoma in Dogs If your vet suspects a\u00a0skin\u00a0adenocarcinoma, they will perform an examination. This may include reviewing the dog\u2019s health record and discussing any symptoms you\u2019ve noticed,\u00a0including difficulty swallowing or eating, bad breath, etc. Fine Needle Biopsy\u00a0 You veterinarian may perform\u00a0a fine needle biopsy to\u00a0collect cells from the tumor to examine under a microscope.\u00a0During this test, the vet will insert a very fine needle into the tumor to collect a small sample of cells. The cells will be examined under a microscope to determine if they are cancerous.\u00a0\u00a0 Surgical Biopsy\u00a0 Your veterinarian\u00a0may also\u00a0perform a surgical procedure to\u00a0remove\u00a0all, or\u00a0a piece,\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0tumor. The removed tissue\u00a0will be sent to a\u00a0medical\u00a0provider\u00a0called a pathologist\u00a0who specializes in examining tissue to\u00a0determine\u00a0if\u00a0the tumor is an\u00a0adenocarcinoma.\u00a0 Treatment for Sweat Gland or Sebaceous Adenocarcinoma in Dogs Surgical procedure Surgical removal of\u00a0the tumor is the most common treatment\u00a0of\u00a0skin\u00a0adenocarcinomas.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chemotherapy\u00a0 Chemotherapy may also be recommended if\u00a0your veterinarian was unable to remove\u00a0all of\u00a0the tumor or the cancer has spread (also called metastasized)\u00a0to\u00a0your dog\u2019s\u00a0lymph\u00a0nodes.\u00a0 Radiation Therapy\u00a0 Radiation\u00a0therapy may also be prescribed to treat a\u00a0skin\u00a0adenocarcinoma. Recovery and Management of Sweat Gland, Sebaceous Adenocarcinoma in Dogs Following surgery, your veterinarian may prescribe\u00a0medicine to ease pain and reduce\u00a0inflammation,\u00a0along with antibiotics to prevent infection.\u00a0Your dog may also require a follow-up visit with your veterinarian to inspect the surgical site and\u00a0ensure proper healing.\u00a0 What\u00a0Is the\u00a0Survival\u00a0Rate for\u00a0Skin Adenocarcinoma in\u00a0Dogs?\u00a0 Your dog should recover completely if a sweat gland, sebaceous adenocarcinoma is completely removed before the cancer spreads to other parts of the body.\u00a0In rare instances,\u00a0a\u00a0sebaceous\u00a0adenocarcinoma\u00a0spreads to nearby parts of the body, but it can also spread throughout a larger portion of a dog\u2019s body.\u00a0"}]
