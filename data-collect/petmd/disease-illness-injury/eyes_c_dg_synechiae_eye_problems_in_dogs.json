They are the result of inflammation in the iris and are particularly common with anterior uveitis (inflammation of the dark tissues of the eye) and trauma to the eye. Synechiae can occur in both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn how this type of eye problem affects cats, please visit this page in the petMD health library. Symptoms and Types Synechiae may be anterior or posterior.     Anterior synechiae is      defined as an adhesion between the iris and the cornea. The cornea is the      transparent cover of the front of the eye.    Posterior synechiae is      the adherence of the iris to the capsule surrounding the lens of the eye.Symptoms seen with synechiae include:     Squinting    Corneal lesions, such      as ulcers    Excessive tearing    Glaucoma    Variation in the color      of the iris    Opacity of the lens    Uveitis    Decreased papillary      reaction to lightCauses     Cat fight injury    Chronic infection    Corneal ulcer    Foreign body injury to      the eye    Hyphema (bleeding in      the front part of the eye)    Penetrating wounds to      the eye    SurgeryDiagnosis Diagnosis is based on an ophthalmic examination, which involves examining the structures of the eye. In addition, dyes may be used on the cornea to detect corneal injuries. Tonometry may be performed to measure the intraocular pressure (the pressure within the eyeball.)  Treatment In many cases, no treatment is necessary. If an underlying cause is diagnosed, it should be treated appropriately. In cases where glaucoma is present, laser surgery to repair the synechiae may be attempted."}]
