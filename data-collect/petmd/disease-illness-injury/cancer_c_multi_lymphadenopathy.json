They play a vital role in the functioning of the immune system acting as filters for blood and storage places for white blood cells. Consequently lymph node inflammation known as lymph lymphatic nighties is often the first indication of disease in the body. The swelling is caused by a reactive increase in white blood cells due to the localized presence of an infectious agent.\n\nThis convergence of cells results in the swollen feel and appearance of the nodes cancerous cells may also be found in a lymph node. Cancer cells may be primary originating in the lymph node itself or may be there as a result of the spread of cancer from another location in the body. Swelling of the lymph nodes can be caused by a reaction to an infectious agent or swelling can result when the lymph nodes themselves are infected. Swollen lymph nodes can usually be detected by touch but sometimes there will be no clinical symptoms.\n\nSwelling may be felt in the area beneath the jaw around the shoulder groin and back legs or under the front legs and what corresponds to the armpit area in humans.

The lymphatic system is part of your dog\u2019s immune system. It includes lymph nodes and a network of lymph vessels called lymphatics that run alongside your dog\u2019s regular blood vessels. The lymph system performs several important functions in your dog\u2019s body, including transporting white blood cells, removing waste products from tissues and cells, and helping to produce disease-fighting antibodies.\u00a0\u00a0 Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped organs that contain immune cells. When your dog\u2019s body is invaded by viruses or bacteria, or your dog has a disease that triggers an immune response, the lymph nodes become enlarged as they work to fight off the invader. Swollen lymph nodes are called\u00a0lymphadenopathy\u00a0or\u00a0lymphadenomegaly. Your vet can tell the difference between swollen lymph nodes and regular lymph nodes by feeling the lymph nodes that are closer to the skin. Lymph nodes that can be felt through the skin are known as \u201cpalpable\u201d nodes. These are located in a few areas: Submandibular: Just under the jaw where it meets the neck Pre-scapular: Under the submandibular lymph nodes at the front of the shoulders Axillary: In the \u201carmpit\u201d of the dog, or where the front legs meet the chest Inguinal: On the underside of the dog where the rear legs meet the abdomen (groin) Popliteal: Just behind the stifles (\u201cknees\u201d) of the rear legs During a physical exam when your veterinarian looks like she is petting your dog, she is actually feeling for abnormalities in the lymph nodes, as well as unusual lumps or bumps. Generally, the only palpable lymph nodes are the submandibular and popliteal in a healthy dog.\u00a0 Symptoms of Swollen Lymph Nodes in Dogs Swollen lymph nodes can sometimes be detected by pet parents at home. If you\u2019re petting your dog and feel a new or unusual bump in one of the areas listed above, it may be a swollen lymph node. In most cases, there are no outward symptoms that accompany your dog\u2019s swollen lymph nodes, particularly if they are only mildly enlarged. However, if the lymph nodes are significantly enlarged\u2014including the nodes inside the thorax and abdomen\u2014 then you should watch for symptoms including: Vomiting Coughing Lethargy Fever Poor appetite Enlarged abdomen Causes of Swollen Lymph Nodes in Dogs Lymph nodes enlarge when the immune system is activated, usually by a disease process. If just one or two lymph nodes are enlarged, this often indicates a localized disease. For example, an infected toe could result in enlarged lymph nodes that drain that area. A systemic infection in which the whole body is affected will often cause many or all of the lymph nodes to be enlarged. Examples include: Demodectic mange Puppy \u201cstrangles\u201d (i.e., juvenile cellulitis) Tick-borne diseases (e.g., Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis) Bacterial infection (e.g.,\u00a0Yersinia pestis, which causes canine plague) Reactive hyperplasia (e.g., active immune response) Fungal infection (e.g.,\u00a0Coccidioidomycosis) Immune-mediated diseases (e.g., pemphigus) Cancer (e.g., lymphosarcoma) Dog Breeds Prone to Swollen Lymph Nodes There aren\u2019t specific breeds that are susceptible to swollen lymph nodes. However, some breeds are susceptible to diseases that will cause swollen lymph nodes. Other breeds are prone to developing lymphosarcoma (cancer of the lymphatic system), including Golden retrievers, Boxers, Dobermans, Rottweilers, and others.\u00a0\u00a0 Toy breeds (such as Yorkies, Poodles, and Dachshunds) are very susceptible to dental disease, and often have enlarged submandibular lymph nodes when they have infected teeth and gums. In most cases, your dog\u2019s lifestyle is a better predictor of their susceptibility to certain diseases that cause enlarged lymph nodes. For example, a hunting dog or a dog that spends a lot of time in the woods is far more likely than an indoor dog to contract tick-borne diseases like Lyme disease and ehrlichiosis, as well as fungal, bacterial, or parasitic diseases that can lead to enlarged lymph nodes. How Vets Diagnose Swollen Lymph Nodes Enlarged lymph nodes are usually fairly obvious on physical exam. If your vet finds swollen lymph nodes, they may collect a sample through one of these methods:\u00a0 \u00a0 FNA: Fine needle aspirate (FNA) is a procedure in which a syringe and needle are used to collect cells that can be examined under a microscope. Your vet will examine these cells on a slide, or they might send the sample out to an external lab for analysis.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Biopsy: Your vet may decide instead to perform a biopsy under general anesthesia. In this procedure, a larger piece of the lymph tissue is removed for analysis by a histopathologist. Usually the histopathologist\u2019s diagnosis is available in 7-10 days. Treatment for Swollen Lymph Nodes Treatment of swollen lymph nodes depends on the underlying cause. Sometimes your vet may start treatment for your dog before receiving a confirmed diagnosis from histopath. This is usually done if your vet is certain of the diagnosis. Treatment might include: Antibiotics Antifungals Anti-inflammatories Steroids Surgery If cancer is confirmed, chemotherapy may be started. Recovery and Management of Swollen Lymph Nodes Recovery depends on the cause of the swollen lymph nodes. If the diagnosis is lymphosarcoma, or cancer of the lymph system, steroids and chemotherapy may be warranted.\u00a0This disease will generally recur after remission.\u00a0 Many tick-borne illnesses are controlled after one round of antibiotics, but it is possible that symptoms will return. It\u2019s very important to monitor your dog for signs of recurring illness or swollen lymph nodes. Contact your vet immediately if you notice new swelling in your dog\u2019s lymph nodes."}]
