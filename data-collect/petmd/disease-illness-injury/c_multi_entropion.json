Entropion is when a dog\u2019s eyelid grows inward so their eyelashes rub against their cornea (clear part of the eye covering the iris). It is the most common eyelid abnormality in dogs. Entropion may affect any part of the lower eyelid, upper eyelid, or both. Entropion in dogs can develop as a primary disease that\u2019s genetically inherited at birth or as a secondary disease affecting dogs at any point of their lives. Symptoms of Entropion in Dogs The main symptom of entropion is an inverted eyelid (turned inward) that causes eye irritation. Additional symptoms include: Excessive tear production and staining\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eye discharge (pus/mucus) Eye redness (conjunctival hyperemia) Keeping the eye closed Causes of Entropion in Dogs Entropion is caused by an eyelid that has an abnormal shape in relation to the eyeball. The factors that lead to entropion in dogs include:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Length of eyelid Shape of skull Shape of the bone cavity that contains the eyeball Gender Extensive skin folds and wrinkles around the eyes Entropion in dogs can be primary, or present at birth, or secondary, meaning it was caused by something else. Primary Entropion in Purebred Dogs Primary entropion is the most common lid disease in purebred dogs. It is thought to be due to a hereditary defect, but the genetic basis is not well understood. The most common breeds predisposed to entropion are: Boxer Bloodhound Bull Mastiff Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Chesapeake Bay Retriever Chow Chow Cocker Spaniel Doberman Pinscher English Bulldog Golden Retriever Great Dane Irish Setter Labrador Retriever Poodle Pug Shar Pei Springer Spaniel Rottweiler Saint Bernard Causes of Secondary Entropion in Dogs Secondary causes of entropion in dogs include: Trauma or inflammation from eye injuries Eyelid scarring or nerve damage Infectious disease Systemic dermatological conditions, such as generalized pyoderma, demodectic mange, or dermatophytosis (ringworm)How Vets Diagnose Entropion in Dogs Veterinarians perform an ophthalmologic examination of your dog\u2019s eyes and eyelids in order to diagnose entropion. Your dog will be awake and not sedated for evaluation, as this allows your vet to observe your dog\u2019s normal eye shape. Treatment for Entropion in Dogs Entropion requires surgery to be treated. The surgery involves removing the extra skin surrounding the eyelids to tighten them back to a normal anatomical position. In growing puppies under 12 weeks of age, eyelid-tacking procedures are typically performed instead of the normal surgery to treat entropion. With eyelid tacking, the skin surrounding the eye is not removed the way it is with a normal entropion surgical procedure. Instead, the excess skin surrounding the eye is temporarily turned outward with tension sutures. This is so a puppy\u2019s facial features can fully develop without the risk of malformations due to surgical removal of the developing eyelid muscle or tissue. Surgical complications from entropion surgery include: Under correction, which occurs if not enough eyelid skin has been removed to correct the eyelid from rubbing the cornea Overcorrection, which occurs if too much eyelid skin is removed, preventing the eyelids from closing normally Take heart that these complications are rare, and surgical correction is the best treatment choice for entropion. The prognosis for animals after entropion surgery is excellent because it restores their comfort and vision. Recovery and Management of Entropion in Dogs Recovery from entropion surgery is rapid. Your dog\u2019s eyes will be swollen from surgery and will be the most swollen around 24 hours after surgery. The swelling can take 2-4 weeks to completely go away. Your dog will need to wear an Elizabethan collar after surgery to protect the sutures around their eyes. Your vet might prescribe topical eye medications depending on whether your dog has underlying corneal disease. They might also prescribe oral antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, and analgesics.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You will need to go back to the vet so they can remove the sutures 14 days after surgery, and the Elizabethan collar can be removed a few days after that. One thing you need to watch out for is keeping your dog from injuring the incision site, which usually happens if your dog is able to remove the Elizabethan collar or if you\u2019ve taken it off your dog too soon after the surgical procedure."}]
