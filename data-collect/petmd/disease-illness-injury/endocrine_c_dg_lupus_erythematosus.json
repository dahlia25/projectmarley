Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (commonly known as SLE), also known as lupus, is a chronic autoimmune condition that occurs when your dog\u2019s immune system attacks his internal organs. Lupus in dogs is relatively rare and can affect more than one organ.\u00a0\u00a0 Every tissue in the body has substances called antigens that can trigger the immune system to react. If the immune system reacts to the antigens, special proteins called antibodies are produced. Antibodies are immune system cells that are programmed to attack invaders. In a dog with lupus, the antibodies attack the dog\u2019s own tissues and organs. Systemic lupus erythematosus in dogs may affect any organ, but it most commonly affects the liver and kidney.\u00a0 Symptoms of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) in Dogs Muscle pain and/or weakness are common symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus in dogs. Other symptoms may include:\u00a0\u00a0 Arthritis (in several joints)\u00a0 Skin rashes or sores (lesions)\u00a0 Fever\u00a0\u00a0 Lethargy\u00a0 Loss of appetite\u00a0\u00a0 Swollen lymph nodes\u00a0 Seizures or tremors\u00a0 Because systemic lupus erythematosus can affect one or several organs, a dog may also experience vomiting, increased water intake, and increased urination.\u00a0\u00a0 Dogs with systemic lupus erythematosus can also develop anemia, a severe condition that occurs when a dog has a low red blood cell count. Symptoms of anemia include pale gums, severe weakness, and lethargy.\u00a0\u00a0 Causes of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) in Dogs There is no known cause for systemic lupus erythematosus in dogs. It is unclear why a dog\u2019s immune system develops the antibodies that attack body tissue and organs.\u00a0\u00a0 Systemic lupus erythematosus can develop in any breed, but is most commonly seen in German Shepherds, Beagles, Afghan Hounds, Collies, Poodles, and Irish Setters. Since some dog breeds are predisposed to the disease, veterinarians believe genetics may play a role.\u00a0\u00a0 Dogs are generally diagnosed when they are young or middle-age, so aging is not considered a risk factor.\u00a0 How Veterinarians Diagnose Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) in Dogs Your veterinarian will perform a complete examination and review your dog\u2019s health history. This will include reviewing symptoms, behavior, and any changes in habits.\u00a0 Your veterinarian will also perform tests to determine the cause of your dog\u2019s symptoms. Those tests may include:\u00a0 X-ray: The veterinarian may x-ray parts of your dog\u2019s body to determine the health of organs such as the kidneys and liver.\u00a0\u00a0 Blood chemistry test: Your veterinarian will check for antibodies that are attacking the body\u2019s tissues and review liver and kidney function.\u00a0 Urinalysis: This test can screen for protein loss and kidney function.\u00a0\u00a0 Ultrasound: A test that allows your vet to see pictures of the dog\u2019s organs.\u00a0 Biopsy of skin lesions: A test that involves studying small samples of skin to look for abnormalities.\u00a0 Cytology: Your veterinarian may collect a small sample of fluid from a swollen joint to examine under a microscope to confirm the diagnosis.\u00a0 Treatment of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) in Dogs Your veterinarian will develop a treatment plan to minimize pain and other symptoms, depending on your pet\u2019s diagnosis. Treatment may include prescription medication to reduce inflammation and medicine to suppress your dog\u2019s immune system. These types of medications can lessen the body\u2019s production of the antibodies.\u00a0 Dogs experiencing kidney failure may also require hospitalization to receive fluids. If your dog has anemia, a blood transfusion might be required. Your veterinarian may also prescribe medication to manage nausea, vomiting, or anorexia, if those are present.\u00a0\u00a0 Recovery and Management of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) in Dogs There is no way to prevent systemic lupus erythematosus, but your veterinarian can prescribe medicine to manage symptoms throughout your dog\u2019s life.\u00a0 Your dog will also require routine visits to the veterinarian to monitor any disease progression, tolerance of medications, and minimize symptoms."}]
