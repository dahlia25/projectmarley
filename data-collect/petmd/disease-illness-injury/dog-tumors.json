Tumors occur when a cell continues to multiply out of control instead of following the natural cycle that ends in cell death. There are two broad categories of tumors: benign and malignant. Benign tumors\u00a0lack the ability to spread or invade other healthy tissue. Although they may need medical attention, these are not cancerous. Malignant tumors, or cancers, spread to other organs and tissues in a process called metastasis. Depending on the type of tumor and how aggressive it is, cancers can pose serious health risks for your dog. To determine how dangerous a tumor is, the best place to start is with a vet visit.\u00a0 Types of Common Dog Tumors Although cancer can occur in many organs and tissues, the following are the most common types of tumors in dogs.\u00a0 Mast Cell Tumor Mast cell tumors\u00a0are malignant tumors that occur in the mast cells in a dog\u2019s skin. Normal mast cells are a type of immune system cell. They play a role in allergic reactions, such as hives and bug bites. Mast cell tumors may look like a lot of different things, including a simple pimple or cyst. They can also mimic benign tumors such as lipomas. Lymphoma Lymphoma is a malignant cancer\u00a0that arises from white blood cells called lymphocytes. Normal lymphocytes are an important part of a dog&#039;s immune system. A classic sign of lymphoma is large, firm lymph nodes, usually found around the jaw, in front of the shoulder, or in the back of the knees. Dogs with lymphoma can also be lethargic or lack interest in food. Lipoma Lipomas\u00a0are benign growths arising from fat cells. They are typically found in subcutaneous fat (the fatty layer just under a dog\u2019s skin). The malignant form of this tumor is called liposarcoma and is less common. Lipomas are extremely common and can sometimes get very large. They are usually a cosmetic issue (pet parents may not love the look of a lumpy, bumpy pup), but they can sometimes cause problems if they are in a bad location. For example, a large lipoma located under a dog\u2019s leg can cause trouble walking. Osteosarcoma Osteosarcoma\u00a0is a type of malignant cancer that arises from bone cells. Osteosarcomas are often painful and can result in bone fractures, limb swelling, and lameness. Histiocytoma These benign tumors arise from histiocytes in the skin. Histiocytes are a type of immune system cell that helps fight infection. They will frequently regress and resolve on their own within a few weeks. Sometimes they can become flat, ulcerated, or red across the top, which has earned them the nickname &quot;button tumors.&quot; Histiocytoma\u00a0is common in young dogs (typically less than 2 years of age). Hemangiosarcoma Hemangiosarcoma\u00a0is a malignant tumor that arises from the cells that line blood vessels. They can pop up anywhere but are most common in a dog\u2019s spleen, heart, and skin. These tumors are often diagnosed when they rupture, which is an emergency situation that results in internal bleeding. Melanoma Melanoma\u00a0is a type of malignant tumor that arises from pigment-carrying cells in the skin called melanocytes. Melanomas in dogs can often be pink or non-pigmented. They can also be flat rather than raised. Most melanomas in dogs occur in the oral cavity (e.g., oral melanoma) but can also be found in the eye, nail bed, or skin. Oral Melanoma Oral melanomas\u00a0are melanomas that grow in a dog\u2019s mouth. They are the most common type of oral tumor in dogs, followed by fibrosarcoma and squamous cell carcinoma. These tumors can be raised or flat and darkly pigmented or pink. You may see them on your dog or you may notice that your dog has bad breath, which is a symptom. They can also be found in routine exams by your veterinarian. Oral melanomas are highly malignant and have often already spread once they are found. Papilloma Papillomas, also called warts, are benign tumors caused by the canine papillomavirus. The virus is shared via contact from one dog to another. They are common in dogs that play in doggy playgroups, dog parks, or daycares and often occur on the lips, tongue, throat, or gums, although they may appear in other locations as well. This virus is species-specific and cannot infect you or any other type of animal in your house. Papillomas will typically resolve on their own within a few weeks. Mammary Gland Carcinoma Mammary gland carcinomas\u00a0are tumors that arise from the mammary or breast tissue of dogs. These tumors most frequently occur in dogs that are not spayed or were spayed after their second heat cycle. About 50% of mammary gland carcinomas are benign when they are discovered, but this determination can only be made by a pathologist after removal. Thyroid Carcinoma Thyroid carcinomas\u00a0are tumors that arise from thyroid cells in the thyroid gland, which is located in a dog\u2019s throat. These tumors can be diagnosed by finding a swelling under the skin but are sadly often only found when evidence of spread is noted in other organs. Symptoms of Dog Tumors  The symptoms of a tumor vary based on the type of tumor, location, and whether the tumor is benign or malignant. Tumors in the brain may cause seizures, changes in behavior, or circling. Mast cell tumors have symptoms related to histamine release: swelling, bleeding or difficulty clotting, and vomiting. Tumors associated with the liver can cause increased liver values on lab work. Some types of cancers have symptoms or changes associated with them, called paraneoplastic syndrome. Paraneoplastic syndrome is caused when tumors excrete hormones or hormone-like substances, or when the dog\u2019s immune system reacts to the tumor and causes symptoms not related to the cancer. Paraneoplastic syndrome can show up on lab work and in noticeable physical changes in your dog. These symptoms may be the first indication that cancer is present. Symptoms can include altered reflexes, weakness, and partial paralysis, among others. For example, elevated calcium levels are associated with lymphosarcoma. You may notice your dog drinking more water than normal, or sometimes the elevation can be found on routine lab work. Some tumors consume blood cells and can be associated with anemias (low red blood cells), low white blood cells, and/or low platelets. Others can cause the opposite. Causes of Dog Tumors The cause of cancer in dogs can be complex. Ultimately, cancer is the result of damage to the cells of the body. Cells grow, divide, perform their job, and ultimately die and are replaced by new cells to keep the body going. However, sometimes the DNA within the cell can become damaged, causing a cell to mutate or divide incorrectly. The body has a lot of checks and balances to correct or destroy mutated cells, but if a mutated cell is left in the body it may continue to grow into a tumor or cancer. Damage to the cells may be triggered by many factors, or more likely a combination of factors. Here are some possible contributing factors: Genetics: Some types of tumors occur more frequently in certain breeds, such as Golden Retrievers, Boxers, Bernese Mountain Dogs, and Rottweilers. This suggests a possible hereditary or genetic component, but more research is needed to better define which dogs are at risk of developing specific cancers. Age: Cancer occurs more frequently in older pets. The exact link between cancer and age is not fully understood, but it\u2019s believed to be linked to a weakening immune system as pets age. As bodies age, it becomes more likely that a mutated cell will get past the body\u2019s defense mechanisms and result in cancer.\u00a0 Environment: Environmental hazards or chemicals can increase the risk of cancer in people\u2014and the pets that live with them. Some examples include a variety of herbicides, pesticides, and other chemicals. Substances such as nickel, uranium, radiation, and asbestos have all been shown to be carcinogens. Prolonged exposure to the sun and UV light may result in higher cancer risks.\u00a0 Ongoing research will hopefully provide more information and treatment options in the future. What To Do if You Find a Lump on Your Dog If you find a lump or bump on your dog, don\u2019t panic. Schedule an appointment with your vet to get the growth checked out. It\u2019s helpful to take note of when you first noticed it, where it\u2019s located, if it has changed (such as gotten bigger or firmer), and whether or not your pet is licking or chewing at it. Measuring the mass with a tape measure or taking a photo may even be helpful.\u00a0 How Vets Diagnose Tumors in Dogs Your veterinarian cannot diagnose a tumor is by looking at or feeling it. They won\u2019t be able to give you a definitive diagnosis without sampling. Fine Needle Aspirate Often, the first step to identifying what kind of growth your pet has is through a fine needle aspirate (FNA). This procedure involves inserting a needle into the mass to obtain a sample of the cells. The needle is typically the same size or even smaller than a needle used to draw blood on pets and is a relatively quick and easy procedure.\u00a0 Your veterinarian will put the cells on a slide and likely send it to the laboratory for evaluation. This will hopefully give them an idea of what kind of growth your pet has.\u00a0 If the tumor is on an internal organ such as the liver or spleen, a fine needle aspirate with ultrasound guidance may be recommended. The limitations of a fine needle aspirate are that the vet is only to get a sample of cells, so sometimes there isn\u2019t enough information for the pathologist at the laboratory to determine the type of growth. Also, if a cancer is diagnosed, the vet may need additional information to determine the best treatment options. Biopsy If the fine needle aspirate was inconclusive if additional information about the tumor is needed, a biopsy may be suggested. A biopsy can be excisional (the entire tumor) or incisional (a small portion of the tumor). The procedure will typically require general anesthesia, but it can provide more information to help with diagnosis and can sometimes remove the tumor completely.\u00a0 For tumors of the stomach, intestines or colon, the biopsy may be performed with an endoscope (a camera placed in the mouth or rectum). If the tumor is on an internal organ such as the liver or spleen and additional sampling is needed, a surgical procedure (exploratory laparotomy) may be performed. Treatment for Tumors in Dogs Canine tumors are staged somewhat differently than human tumors. Depending on the type of tumor, they may be staged numerically with Roman numbers ranging from 0 to IV. A higher number means the cancer has spread further. Other types of tumors are graded differently. Different types of cancer have different treatments. The treatment recommended for a dog\u2019s tumor depends on several factors: How aggressive you want to be with treatment Whether the tumor is one that typically spreads to other organs or stays locally invasive How advanced or large the tumor is (the stage) How serious the tumor-related symptoms are Treatment options include surgical removal, radiation, immunotherapy, and\u00a0chemotherapy. Recovery and Management of Tumors in Dogs Some types of dog tumors can be cured. These are usually tumors that are locally invasive and can be completely removed surgically. Types of cancer that spread or metastasize to other parts of your dog\u2019s body can be managed with treatment but are, unfortunately, not usually curable. The good news is that cancer treatment in dogs is often well tolerated with minimal side effects. For example, chemotherapy in dogs does not typically cause hair loss and has only mild gastrointestinal side effects. You can even administer some chemotherapeutic drugs at home, which decreases stress for your pet. When your pet is diagnosed with cancer, it\u2019s best to get as much information as possible before you start making decisions. A consult with a veterinary oncologist can help provide answers around your dog\u2019s possible outcomes and what to expect. They can explain treatment options in terms of what each one means as far as longevity and quality of life for your pet. Even if you ultimately choose not to proceed with chemotherapy or radiation, the more knowledge you are equipped with, the more at peace you will be with your decisions."}]
