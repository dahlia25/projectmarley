The pancreas is located on the right side of a dog\u2019s abdomen close to the end of the stomach and the beginning of the small intestine. The pancreas is responsible for producing hormones as well as digestive enzymes that help to break down food during the digestion process.\u00a0 The second most common type of pancreatic cancer in dogs, after insulinomas, is pancreatic adenocarcinoma. An adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer that originates in the glands that produce digestive enzymes. Pancreatic cancer in dogs is typically an aggressive form of cancer that progresses rapidly and easily spreads to other organs, including:\u00a0\u00a0 Liver\u00a0 Lymph Nodes\u00a0\u00a0 Spleen\u00a0\u00a0 Intra-Abdominal Fat\u00a0 Bone\u00a0 Kidneys\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Brain\u00a0 Symptoms of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma in Dogs Symptoms of pancreatic adenocarcinoma are generally vague and are most commonly associated with gastrointestinal upset and decreases in overall energy and appetite.\u00a0\u00a0 Tumors of the pancreas may grow large enough, or in the appropriate region, to obstruct the common bile duct of the liver. The common bile duct carries bile from the liver and gall bladder by way of the pancreas to the intestines. Interference of this anatomy can lead to a gall bladder obstruction and signs of liver disease.\u00a0 Metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma will also cause symptoms that are associated with the body systems that it spreads to.\u00a0 Other symptoms may include:\u00a0 Gastrointestinal signs such as vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or development of an abdominal mass\u00a0 Increased thirst and urination\u00a0 Difficulty breathing\u00a0 Jaundice (yellowing of the skin)\u00a0 Bone pain\u00a0 Hair loss\u00a0 Changes in mentation\u00a0 Causes of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma in Dogs The general cause for this type of cancer is unknown. Labrador Retrievers, Airedale Terriers, Boxers, and Spaniel breeds typically have a genetic predisposition to pancreatic cancer. This disease is also found to occur more commonly in female dogs than male dogs. How Veterinarians Diagnose Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma in Dogs Veterinarians can use multiple diagnostic methods to diagnose pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\u00a0\u00a0 Blood work may show abnormalities in liver or kidney values, signs of anemia, dehydration, and elevated white blood cells. Imaging techniques including radiography, ultrasonography, or CT scanning can be used to visualize a pancreatic mass (tumor).\u00a0 If a tumor is detected, it can be tested for cancer using cytology (analysis of cells collected with a needle) or histopathology (a tissue biopsy).\u00a0 Treatment for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma in Dogs Surgery is typically not recommended for pancreatic adenocarcinoma because, by the time of diagnosis, there is a very high probability of metastasis. Chemotherapy has also been unsuccessful in treating pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Recovery and Management of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma in Dogs The prognosis for pancreatic adenocarcinomas is typically poor. Supportive care is recommended until the dog\u2019s quality of life is adversely impacted. At that point, humane euthanasia may be recommended. Your vet will be able to determine a medical management plan that works best for your dog depending on their diagnosis."}]
