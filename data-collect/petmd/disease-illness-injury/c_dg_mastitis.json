Mastitis is an inflammation of the mammary glands in female dogs. It can occur with or without infection. Typically, mastitis occurs postpartum, due to how messy the whelping box can get and/or weening the pups abruptly or too early. There are multiple types of mastitis in dogs.\u00a0\u00a0 Acute Mastitis: Sudden swelling of the mammary gland that includes heat and pain. The milk will be obviously abnormal. This type of mastitis may also cause changes in the mother, such as lethargy.\u00a0\u00a0 Septic Mastitis: Sudden swelling of the mammary gland associated with heat, pain, abnormal milk coloration, and changes in the mother such as lethargy, changes in appetite, fever. Septic mastitis and its symptoms are typically caused by bacteria.\u00a0\u00a0 Chronic or Subclinical Mastitis: Long-term inflammation of mammary tissue accompanied by a lack of obvious clinical signs such as swelling or warmth.\u00a0\u00a0 Non-septic Mastitis: Inflammation of the mammary tissues without a cause such as bacteria or fungus.\u00a0\u00a0 Gangrenous Mastitis: The teat, and possibly surrounding tissues, appears black or bruised. The milk may be blood-tinged or bloody. The mother will also be very ill, with symptoms such as vomiting, decreased appetite, fever, changes in blood pressure.\u00a0 Symptoms of Mastitis in Dogs The symptoms of mastitis vary, depending on the type of mastitis. Affected glands will have milk or fluid that may be described as discolored, bloody, or pus-like in appearance. If they are infected, glands may be described as swollen, warm, firm, discolored, or ulcerated (skin broken open).\u00a0\u00a0 Acute mastitis symptoms may include glands that are hot and painful. This condition may progress to septic mastitis if it\u2019s not treated in time. In septic mastitis, clinical signs include fever, depression, anorexia, lethargy, or mother neglecting puppies.\u00a0\u00a0 The only clinical sign observed with chronic or subclinical mastitis is failure of the pups to thrive. For non-septic mastitis, which commonly occurs at weaning about 3-4 weeks after birth, common signs include swollen glands that are painful to touch, even though the dog is relatively healthy and alert.\u00a0\u00a0 In severe cases of mastitis, the mother will be sick and may show symptoms such as:\u00a0 Fever\u00a0 Refusal to eat\u00a0 Vomiting\u00a0 Listlessness\u00a0 Rapid heart rate\u00a0 Depression\u00a0 Severe drop in blood pressure\u00a0 Causes of Mastitis in Dogs Mastitis is most commonly caused by bacteria, such as E. coli, enterococci, staphylococcus, and streptococcus spp. Other causes include:\u00a0 Fungus, such as blastomycosis and mycobacterium\u00a0 Trauma, such as a wound caused by sharp edges of the whelping box or (rarely) a puppy scratching the teat while nursing\u00a0 Damp and unsanitary environment\u00a0 Prolonged milk stasis, or a build-up of milk\u00a0 Septicemia, or sepsis\u00a0 Death of newborn puppies\u00a0 How Veterinarians Diagnose Mastitis in Dogs Mastitis is typically diagnosed with a physical exam and any information pet parents can provide to a veterinarian. After a physical exam and history have been taken, further diagnostics are done to confirm the severity and type of mastitis so the appropriate course of treatment can be selected. Additional imaging may be done to determine the extent of injury and the critical nature of the condition.\u00a0\u00a0 Blood work such as a CBC and biochemistry may be done to rule out:\u00a0 Elevated white blood cell count (WBC), which can indicate a severe case of mastitis\u00a0 Platelet abnormalities, which can indicate gangrenous mastitis and sepsis\u00a0 Dehydration\u00a0 A cytology procedure may be done, which can reveal an increase in white blood cells and either bacteria or fungus (rare). During a cytology study, the vet will examine groups of cells to detect abnormalities.\u00a0\u00a0 A culture of the milk or fluid from the gland may be sent off so the veterinarian will know which medications to prescribe. Radiographs (x-rays) may be done to confirm or rule out gangrenous mastitis. An ultrasound may also be done to determine if there have been any abnormal changes in blood flow or tissue definition. Samples of tissue may be taken and sent to a lab for evaluation (biopsy/histopathology) to confirm mastitis and not cancer.\u00a0\u00a0 Treatment of Mastitis in Dogs Treatment depends on the type and severity of the mastitis. Severe cases require hospitalization along with IV fluids, pain medication, and antibiotics. Surgical therapy may be needed for necrotic (dead) tissue, as this must be drained, flushed, and removed. Antibiotic therapy tends to last for 2-3 weeks.\u00a0 Acute mastitis is treated using broad-spectrum antibiotics, and chronic mastitis is treated based on culture and sensitivity results. Because mastitis affects both mom and puppies, mom is started on antibiotics based upon the pH of the milk or fluid expressed from the gland until the culture results from the cytology come back from the lab. It is important to know the age of the puppies and if they are still nursing, as there are some antibiotics that may be harmful to them.\u00a0 In addition to oral medication, topical therapy will be needed. If the mother is still nursing, the infected glands are milked by hand every 6 hours until signs of inflammation (e.g., heat, swelling, redness, pain) improve. Prior to milking, warm compresses may be applied to encourage drainage.\u00a0 If the gland is minimally painful, a massage may be done to encourage blood flow and help break up congested tissue. Cold laser therapy may be recommended to help reduce pain and inflammation. Cold laser therapy is helpful because it is a noninvasive procedure that uses a specific frequency of light to stimulate tissue healing and improve blood circulation to specific areas such as the skin and mammary tissue.\u00a0\u00a0 Cabbage compresses may also be done to decrease inflammation. Not much is understood about what makes cabbage so helpful, but it is believed that a cabbage compress can be beneficial because it acts as an effective cold compress to relieve mild inflammation. This therapy may be done in the clinic if the mother is hospitalized, or it may be recommended as part of at-home care. After treatment with cabbage compresses, puppies can nurse from affected glands when wraps are removed.\u00a0 Continuing to nurse puppies prevents milk stasis and helps with drainage. If the mother is currently taking antibiotics, probiotics may be helpful to the mother and puppies to help maintain gut flora and prevent diarrhea.\u00a0 When treating mastitis, there may be cases in which puppies must be weaned early or an alternative source of nutrition provided, including:\u00a0 Multiple glands are abscessed\u00a0 An antibiotic is needed that is unsafe in neonates\u00a0 Mother is systemically ill\u00a0 Mother refuses to nurse\u00a0 Treatment of mastitis associated with a phantom pregnancy may include antibiotic therapy and cabbage leaf therapy. Phantom pregnancy is also known as pseudopregnancy or false pregnancy. This occurs when a dog displays maternal behavior in combination with the physical signs of heat followed by signs of pregnancy, without being pregnant. This behavior can be observed in an intact female dog and is treated by removing the object (e.g., toy, blanket) that is being \u201cmothered.\u201d\u00a0 Recovery and Management of Mastitis in Dogs If a dog is diagnosed with either acute or chronic mastitis, the prognosis is good. Clinical signs should clear up in about 2-3 weeks in response to treatment. If the mastitis is not responsive to treatment or there is gangrenous mastitis associated with septicemia, the prognosis is guarded.\u00a0\u00a0 The following steps can help reduce the right of mastitis:\u00a0 Trimming puppies\u2019 nails to reduce wounds to the mother that may lead to infection.\u00a0 Monitoring neonates to make sure they are nursing from all glands to avoid sudden and prolonged milk statis. If neonates are not nursing from all the glands, it is OK to move them around.\u00a0 Keep the area where mom and puppies are kept clean, dry, and free of sharp edges to prevent an environment where bacteria can thrive\u00a0 Change bedding in nursing environment at least 1-2 times per day and scrubbing the box daily to reduce bacteria.\u00a0"}]
