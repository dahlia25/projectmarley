The parathyroid glands are small, hormone-secreting glands that are located on or near the thyroid glands. The term para- refers to adjacent or alongside, and thyroid refers to the actual thyroid gland; the thyroid and parathyroid glands are located side by side in the neck, near the windpipe or trachea. Hyperparathyroidism is a medical condition related to the parathyroid glands, in which over active parathyroid glands cause abnormally high levels of parathyroid hormone (also known as parathormone or PTH) to circulate in the blood. \u00a0 Primary hyperparathyroidism refers to a condition in which a tumor in the parathyroid gland produces excessive levels of parathyroid hormone, leading to increased blood calcium levels (hypercalcemia). \u00a0 Secondary hyperparathyroidism can be caused by a deficiency of calcium and vitamin D, and is associated with malnutrition or long-term (chronic) kidney disease. \u00a0 There is no known genetic cause for primary hyperparathyroidism, but its association with certain breeds suggests a possible hereditary basis in some cases. Secondary hyperparathyroidism can develop in association with hereditary kidney disease (known as hereditary nephropathy), but is not inherited per se. Keeshonds seem to show some predilection for this disease. In dogs, the average age is ten years, with a range of 5 to 15 years of age. \u00a0 Symptoms and Types \u00a0 Most dogs with primary hyperparathyroidism do not appear illSigns are usually mild and are due solely to the effects of high levels of calcium in the bloodIncreased urinationIncreased thirstLack of appetiteSluggishnessVomitingWeaknessPresence of stones in the urinary tractStupor and comaEnlarged parathyroid glands in the neck may be palpableNutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism is caused by diets that have too little calcium and vitamin D or too much phosphorus \u2013 it is a type of malnutritionNutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism sometimes is associated with bone fractures and general poor body condition\u00a0 Causes \u00a0 Primary hyperparathyroidism \u2013 PTH-secreting tumor of the parathyroid gland; in most cases only one gland has a tumor; malignant tumors of the parathyroid glands are uncommonSecondary hyperparathyroidism is related to malnutrition \u2013 nutritional deficiency of calcium and vitamin D or nutritional excess of phosphorusSecondary hyperparathyroidism is also related to long-term (chronic) kidney disease. Calcium is lost through the kidneys and absorption of calcium is reduced through the intestinal tract due to deficiency of a hormone known as calcitriol (which regulates levels and absorption of calcium in the intestines), which is produced by the kidneys; may also be due to the retention of phosphorus in the bodyPrimary hyperparathyroidism \u2013 unknownSecondary hyperparathyroidism \u2013 related to calcium/vitamin D malnutrition or to long-term (chronic) kidney disease\u00a0  Diagnosis \u00a0 Your veterinarian will be looking for cancer first and foremost for the cause for this disease. However, several other possibilities will also be considered, such as renal failure and vitamin D intoxication, which have been known to be found in some rodenticides. Other possibilities are too much calcium in the blood. A urinalysis will reveal calcium and phosphate levels. \u00a0 Serum ionized calcium determination is often normal in patients with chronic renal failure and high in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcemia that is associated with a malignancy. If kidney stones are suspected, your veterinarian may use X-ray and ultrasound imaging of the parathyroid gland to discover whether there is tumor there. If nothing can be found using these diagnostic techniques, your veterinarian may need to use surgery to explore the area of the thyroid and parathyroid. \u00a0  Treatment \u00a0 Primary hyperparathyroidism generally requires inpatient care and surgery. Secondary hyperparathyroidism related to malnutrition or long-term (chronic) kidney disease in non-critical patients can be managed on an outpatient basis. Your veterinarian may recommend calcium supplements to stabilize the levels of calcium in the blood and intestines. Low phosphorus diets for secondary hyperparathyroidism related to long-term kidney disease may be recommended as well. Surgery is the treatment of choice for primary hyperparathyroidism and is often important in establishing the diagnosis. If a tumor is found, the best resolution is often surgical removal of the tumor. Medications will be prescribed according to the final diagnosis and treatment plan. \u00a0 Prevention \u00a0 No strategies exist for prevention of primary hyperparathyroidism; however, secondary hyperparathyroidism related to malnutrition is prevented by proper nutrition. Living and Management \u00a0 Postoperative low levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcemia) is relatively common after surgical removal of one or more parathyroid glands for treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism, especially in patients with presurgical calcium concentrations greater than 14 mg/d. Your veterinarian will want to check serum calcium concentrations once or twice daily for at least one week after surgery, and will schedule your dog for regular blood tests to check the status of the kidney."}]
