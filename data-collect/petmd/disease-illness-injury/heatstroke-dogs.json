Dr. Veronica Higgs explains what you need to know to keep your dog safe.", "articleBody": "What is Heatstroke in Dogs? Heatstroke is the most severe condition in a spectrum of heat-related illnesses. The first sign a dog may be developing heat-induced illness is typically heat cramps, characterized by muscle spasms. This is often related to dehydration and electrolyte depletion. If the dog continues to be exposed to the heat, this will likely progress to heat exhaustion. Heat exhaustion is characterized by fatigue and weakness but may also include vomiting and diarrhea. In the heat exhaustion phase, the pet will likely still have a normal or slightly elevated temperature and dehydration. The hallmark of the transition from heat exhaustion to heatstroke is central nervous system signs such as disorientation or seizures, an elevated temperature (greater than 104 degrees Fahrenheit), and often, multiple organ dysfunction. Heatstroke results from an inability of the body to cool down. This results in damage to the tissues of the body (inflammation), which leads to decreased blood flow to the organs and can ultimately cause organ damage and failure. Every system in the body can be affected by heatstroke, but main ones include: Heart (elevated heart rate) Central nervous system (disorientation, seizures) Gastrointestinal tract (vomiting and diarrhea, often bloody) Kidneys Liver Coagulation system (increased risk of bleeding) Furthermore, heatstroke\u00a0overpowers the body\u2019s defense\u00a0mechanisms by damaging heat shock proteins, which are designed to protect the body from\u00a0stress and heat. \u00a0 Heatstroke can occur very quickly and result in death in under an hour, especially if the pet does not have access to shade, water, and rest. This is an absolute\u00a0emergency,\u00a0and pet\u00a0parents\u00a0should take their dog immediately to the local emergency veterinary hospital if they suspect heatstroke. \u00a0 Symptoms of Heatstroke in Dogs The signs of heatstroke include: Excessive\u00a0panting Reddened gums/mucous membranes Tachycardia (fast heart rate) Dehydration\u00a0 Elevated temperature\u00a0(104 F and above)\u00a0 Vomiting\u00a0(with or without blood)\u00a0 Diarrhea (with or without blood) Disorientation/stumbling Weakness/collapse Seizures/death\u00a0 Causes of Heatstroke in Dogs There are two\u00a0classic examples of how a dog develops heatstroke: \u00a0 A dog left in the car, even on a relatively cool day: According to a recent study, the temperature inside a car increases by an average of 40 F per hour. This means even if it is only 70 F outside, the inside of the car can easily be greater than 110 F.\u00a0For this reason, a dog should never be left alone in the car, even with the windows partially open. \u00a0 A dog exercising on a hot, humid day: Use extreme caution when exercising your dog on summer days. Dogs can develop heatstroke even when walking for relatively short periods of time. Consider performing outdoor activities early in the morning or late at night and be sure to provide plenty of fresh water. \u00a0 Some dogs have a higher risk of developing\u00a0heatstroke. Dogs with: Brachycephalic syndrome (meaning short-nosed dogs with flattened faces such as pugs or boxers) Heart\u00a0disease Laryngeal paralysis Obesity Tracheal collapse Older dogs are also at higher risk. However, any dog can develop heatstroke. Dogs are more susceptible to the effects of heat-related illnesses than humans because they are not able to cool themselves by sweating. The main way dogs cool themselves is by panting causing\u00a0water to evaporate from their tongue, but this is inefficient,\u00a0and they can overheat quickly. Heatstroke cases are more commonly seen in Southern states, and in general in areas with higher temperatures and humidity. Heatstroke is becoming a growing danger due to climate change and extreme weather patterns. How Veterinarians Diagnose Heatstroke in Dogs Heatstroke is often a diagnosis based on history of heat exposure (being left in the car, exercising), clinical signs, and body temperature greater than 104 F). A complete medical history for any predisposing factors such as heart disease, laryngeal paralysis, and tracheal\u00a0collapse\u00a0is also helpful. If you suspect your dog may be experiencing heatstroke, call your veterinarian or local emergency veterinary hospital immediately. They will likely instruct you on beginning to cool your dog prior to arrival at the hospital. This is extremely important. Cooling your pet prior to arrival at the hospital has been shown to increase their chances of survival from 50% to 80%. The cooling technique is crucial to preventing more damage. When cooling your pet, never use ice, as it can increase the risk of shock (drop in blood pressure, further damage to organs) and even cause hypothermia. Try to move your pet to a cool or shaded area with a fan if possible. Wet your dog with room temperature water and drape wet towels on the back of the dog during transportation to the hospital. \u00a0 Once you arrive at the hospital, the veterinarian will start with a thorough physical examination to check your dog\u2019s mental status and temperature. If you initiated cooling\u00a0measure\u00a0before arriving at the hospital, the temperature may be normal and will need to be carefully monitored to make sure it does not become too low, creating\u00a0hypothermia. A complete blood count, serum blood chemistry, and urinalysis will all likely be recommended for a baseline evaluation. There may already be elevation in liver and kidney\u00a0values,\u00a0but serial monitoring is recommended. Treating Heatstroke in Dogs Based on the diagnosis of heatstroke, your dog will need to be\u00a0hospitalized\u00a0and started on IV fluids to treat dehydration. Medication will be given to reduce or prevent symptoms of vomiting and\u00a0diarrhea. Antibiotics will likely be a part of your pet\u2019s treatment to prevent infection. Depending on the severity of your pet\u2019s condition, medications may also be used to help with swelling of the brain and seizure activity. Additional care may include oxygen therapy, plasma transfusions, and/or anti-arrhythmic medications as indicated. While in the hospital, the veterinary staff will monitor your dog\u2019s mental status, temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate and effort, and may perform an electrocardiogram test. Repeat bloodwork is likely, to monitor any changes and help guide therapy. \u00a0 Recovery and Management of Heatstroke in Dogs Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment of heatstroke are important for a dog\u2019s survival and recovery. Recovering from heatstroke is directly related to how high the dog\u2019s temperature was, for how long, and how quickly they arrived at the\u00a0hospital. Major damage can occur when the body\u2019s temperature reaches higher than 109 F. The\u00a0prognosis is considered poor if multiple organ failure occurs. \u00a0 Most dogs that survive the initial 24 hours will live\u00a0but will remain hospitalized on IV fluids and supportive care for 2-3 days. Once discharged, they will need lots of rest and extra TLC, but typically they can make a full recovery and go on to live normal lives. Your vet will likely want to check bloodwork 1-2 weeks after the heatstroke event to ensure all organs are working properly. \u00a0 Prevention of\u00a0Heatstroke in Dogs Prevention is key for heatstroke in dogs; keep in mind the following when the weather is hot: Always ensure that your pet has access to shade and water when outdoors. Only exercise dogs in cooler parts of the day (early in the morning, late at night). Even short walks can cause heatstroke in predisposed dogs or on extremely hot, humid days. Never leave dogs alone in cars, even on seemingly cool days. Even if the windows are left partially open or the car is parked in the shade, the inside of the car can be greater than 40 F hotter than outside. On hot days, keep your pet inside the house with air-conditioning, especially if they have a predisposed condition such as older age, brachycephalic syndrome, obesity, heart disease, tracheal collapse, or laryngeal paralysis. \u00a0"}]
