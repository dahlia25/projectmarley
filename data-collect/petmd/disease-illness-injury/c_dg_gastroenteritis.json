Gastroenteritis in dogs is defined as an inflammation of a dog\u2019s stomach (gastro-) and small intestine (-enteritis). In simple terms, gastroenteritis is an upset stomach. Pet parents might use the term \u201cdog stomach bug\u201d to describe this kind of illness, but the possible causes go beyond a viral infection. If your dog has bloody diarrhea or vomit, go to the emergency vet immediately, as these are signs of acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome (AHDS). Acute Hemorrhagic Diarrhea Syndrome (AHDS) / Hemorrhagic Gastroenteritis (HGE) Acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome, also known as hemorrhagic gastroenteritis (HGE), is a specific and critical form of enteritis. It is a medical emergency and one of the most serious causes of diarrhea in dogs. AHDS can be fatal\u2014your dog can become septic (caused by a dangerous infection in the bloodstream), lose too much protein, or experience complications. Dogs affected with this disease have been shown to have inflammation of only the intestines, not the stomach. If you suspect your dog has AHDS, take them to the vet immediately. Symptoms of Gastroenteritis in Dogs  Take your dog to the emergency vet if you see the signs of AHDS: Sudden onset of bloody diarrhea with no known cause, such as a change in diet Vomiting, with or without blood Lethargy \u00a0(moving slowly, sluggish) Call your vet if your dog is showing any signs of gastroenteritis: Sudden vomiting Sudden diarrhea Lethargy Dogs suffering from gastroenteritis exhibit a sudden onset of vomiting and/or diarrhea and may lose a large volume of body fluids and electrolytes. This can cause dehydration. Monitor your dog\u2019s hydration and activity level. If your dog is dehydrated and/or lethargic, go to the emergency vet. This indicates a more serious situation that needs immediate treatment. You can check for dehydration by gently lifting the skin on the back of your dog\u2019s neck. If it stays raised and doesn\u2019t go back to place quickly, your dog is probably dehydrated.Another tip to test your dog for dehydration: press on your dog\u2019s gums, which should turn from white back to pink within 2 seconds. If the pink takes any longer to come back, your dog is probably dehydrated. Other signs of dehydration include: Panting Dry nose and eyes Dry, pasty gums and thick saliva Loss of appetite Loss of skin elasticity (when you pull your dog\u2019s skin and it is slow to snap back) Causes of Gastroenteritis and AHDS in Dogs Gastroenteritis in dogs can be caused by many underlying issues. Your vet can run diagnostic tests to help you figure out why your dog is sick. Some possible causes include: Dietary indiscretion (meaning your dog ate something they shouldn\u2019t, such as fatty food, food that\u2019s gone bad, or inedible objects) Gastric ulcers Toxins Cancer Kidney failure Liver failure Bacterial infection, such as clostridium, campylobacter, salmonella, or E. coli Viral infection, such as parvovirus, coronavirus, or distemper Parasites Food allergies The exact cause of AHDS remains unknown. Some vets theorize that the condition begins with a bacterial infection in the intestine caused by Clostridium perfringens type A. This infection creates dangerous toxins that erode the protective lining of the intestine, allowing fluids and blood to leak out. How Vets Diagnose Gastroenteritis in Dogs  This diagnosis is made when a dog has a sudden case of vomiting or diarrhea, has been sluggish and lethargic, and hasn\u2019t had an appetite. Describing your dog\u2019s symptoms can help your veterinarian make the diagnosis. Your vet will also check your dog for dehydration and signs of abdominal pain. To rule out other possible causes of vomiting and diarrhea, such as parvovirus, parasites, a gastrointestinal obstruction, cancer, kidney disease, and other more serious conditions, your veterinarian may need a fecal analysis, bloodwork, X-ray, or ultrasound. Diagnosis for AHDS in Dogs Your vet will also consider AHDS as a possible cause if your dog has bloody, watery diarrhea; dehydration; and an elevated packed cell volume (the number of red blood cells currently circulating). There is no specific test to diagnose AHDS in dogs. If no other cause is found for your dog\u2019s symptoms, a diagnosis of AHDS may be made as a &quot;diagnosis of exclusion.\u201d An Addisonian crisis, which is when a dog with Addison\u2019s disease has acute gastrointestinal symptoms that are often bloody, can look exactly like AHDS. This is fatal if untreated. Since an Addisonian crisis and AHDS are both so serious, it is critical to take your dog to the vet immediately if they are dehydrated or have bloody diarrhea. Treatment for Gastroenteritis in Dogs The goal of treatment is to stop the vomiting/diarrhea and maintain hydration. Depending on your dog\u2019s condition and the underlying cause, your veterinarian may administer anti-vomiting medication, antibiotics, and antacid medications specifically formulated for dogs. If your dog is vomiting, the medications will be administered through injection. Your dog may also require hospitalization for IV (intravenous) fluids and electrolytes. Treatment for AHDS in Dogs AHDS is very serious and cannot be treated at home. If your dog has bloody diarrhea or vomit, go to the emergency vet immediately. Dogs with AHDS are losing a life-threatening amount of fluid, protein, and electrolytes, and they must be hospitalized for aggressive IV therapy, electrolyte supplementation, and medication. With AHDS, the survival rate is 90\u201395% if appropriate, aggressive therapy is started quickly. Most dogs recover in two or three days. Recovery and Management of Gastroenteritis in Dogs After your dog comes home from the vet, you can continue care. If the vet finds that your dog\u2019s gastroenteritis is caused by something that\u2019s contagious, isolate your dog from your other pets. Do not allow your dog to eat or drink until there has been no vomiting for six to eight hours. Then you may give your dog small amounts of clear liquids (water, Gatorade, Pedialyte, or other electrolyte solution) every two hours. If your dog does not vomit the fluid after 12 hours, give frequent, small meals of boiled hamburger and rice or boiled chicken and rice, about \u00bc cup or less per feeding. Your vet might also send you home with samples of a low-fat, easily digestible prescription diet such as these Recovery From AHDS in Dogs Part of your dog\u2019s recovery plan from AHDS should be a bland diet that\u2019s high in carbohydrates and low in protein and fat. Your vet may offer you special canned food, or you can cook for your dog. Cooked rice or pasta; potatoes with some cottage cheese; lean, boiled ground beef; or skinless chicken are good choices for a couple of weeks as your dog&#039;s gut heals and their appetite returns. Ask your veterinarian about options for cooking for your dog to ensure that you provide the right nutrients in the right amounts."}]
