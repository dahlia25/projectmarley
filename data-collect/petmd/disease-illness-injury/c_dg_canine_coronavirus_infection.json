Canine coronavirus is a highly infectious viral disease affecting dogs all around the world. Its name is based on the virus appearing to resemble a crown when viewed under a high-powered microscope.\u00a0\u00a0 Canine coronavirus is very different from the human novel coronavirus causing the pandemic of 2020 (COVID-19). Canine coronavirus is not transmissible to humans. Canine coronaviruses are, however, highly contagious between dogs.\u00a0\u00a0 Canine coronavirus often causes mild or hard-to-spot symptoms; however, it can be fatal under certain conditions. Because canine coronavirus is highly contagious, it is common in kenneled dogs but can also occur in healthy dogs who have no symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0 There are two main types of canine coronavirus in the United States: enteric and respiratory.\u00a0\u00a0 Enteric canine coronavirus spreads through feces and causes damage to the cells lining the gastrointestinal tract. Dogs typically display clinical signs related to gastrointestinal upset, such as vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy.\u00a0\u00a0 Respiratory canine coronavirus spreads through the air and enters the lungs. It is part of a larger respiratory disease complex in dogs and causes coughing, sneezing, and difficulty breathing.\u00a0\u00a0 Symptoms of Canine Coronavirus Symptoms of canine coronavirus vary based on the strain.\u00a0\u00a0 When a dog has canine enteric coronavirus (CECoV), the virus travels to the intestinal cells and replicates quickly, destroying those cells in the process. Young, immunocompromised, or stressed dogs (such as those in dogs shows or shelters) may have more severe symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0 Those symptoms may include:\u00a0\u00a0 Diarrhea (sometimes bloody)\u00a0\u00a0 Vomiting\u00a0 Decreased appetite\u00a0 Painful abdomen\u00a0 Lethargy\u00a0 Dehydration\u00a0 Fever\u00a0 Seizures in severe cases\u00a0 Canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) is part of the complex disease called Canine Infectious Respiratory Disease, or CIRD. Healthy dogs can also carry this virus without obvious symptoms. Typically, dogs acquire CRCoV in addition to other bacteria and viruses, including:\u00a0\u00a0 Canine distemper virus\u00a0 Canine parainfluenza virus\u00a0 Canine adenovirus\u00a0 Canine influenza virus\u00a0 Canine herpesvirus\u00a0 Canine reovirus\u00a0 Canine pneumovirus\u00a0 Bordetella bronchiseptica bacteria\u00a0 Mycoplasma bacterial species\u00a0 Streptococcus species\u00a0 Zooepidemicus species\u00a0 Canine respiratory coronavirus is a common cause of quick-onset upper respiratory disease in dogs, especially those in crowded or stressful settings. The virus attacks the cells lining the lungs, causing damage, and allowing other opportunistic bacteria to follow.\u00a0\u00a0 Symptoms can vary from mild to severe depending on the other bacteria involved. Common symptoms include:\u00a0 Coughing\u00a0 Sneezing\u00a0 Difficulty breathing\u00a0 Eye discharge\u00a0 Nasal discharge\u00a0 Gagging/regurgitation at the end of the cough\u00a0 Fever\u00a0 Lethargy\u00a0 Decreased appetite\u00a0 Causes of Canine Coronavirus Canine coronavirus is highly contagious and spreads quickly between dogs. Dogs develop canine enteric coronavirus through ingestion of infected feces. The incubation period after exposure is 1-3 days. Dogs, symptomatic or not, may then shed the virus in their feces for 2 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0 Canine respiratory coronavirus is transmitted through:\u00a0 Respiratory secretions aerosolized and inhaled\u00a0 Direct contact between dogs\u00a0 Contaminated objects that may easily carry bacteria or viruses, such as blankets, bowls, toys, etc. How Veterinarians Diagnose Canine Coronavirus If your vet suspects your dog has canine coronavirus, they will perform an examination. This may include reviewing your dog\u2019s health history and current symptoms. They will ask you about any concerns you have about your dog\u2019s health including behavior and noticeable symptoms.\u00a0 Blood Chemistry Test &amp; Complete Blood Count\u00a0 Depending on the severity of your dog\u2019s symptoms, your veterinarian may recommend performing a blood chemistry test and complete blood count to have a clear overall picture of your dog\u2019s health. This can help determine if your dog requires antibiotics, or other treatments.\u00a0 X-Ray\u00a0 Your vet may take x-rays of your dog\u2019s abdomen and chest to rule out other diseases that cause similar symptoms. Treatment of Canine Coronavirus Your veterinarian will treat your dog\u2019s canine coronavirus based on health history and current symptoms. Because there is not a specific treatment for canine coronavirus, your veterinarian will prescribe treatment of your dog\u2019s symptoms to lessen their severity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dogs with both CECoV and CRCoV may not require any treatment at all because many dogs recover on their own. Depending on the severity, some dogs may receive outpatient treatment such as:\u00a0\u00a0 Fluids for hydration\u00a0 Oral anti-nausea medications\u00a0\u00a0 Oral anti-diarrheal medications\u00a0\u00a0 Gastrointestinal prescription foods\u00a0\u00a0 Probiotics to re-establish gastrointestinal flora\u00a0\u00a0 Anti-inflammatories and/or cough medicine for coughing in dogs with CRCoV\u00a0\u00a0 More severe cases may require hospitalization with:\u00a0\u00a0 IV fluids for hydration\u00a0 IV antibiotics and/or anti-nausea medications\u00a0\u00a0 Nutritional support\u2014feeding tubes or total parenteral nutrition\u00a0 Appetite stimulants\u00a0 Heat support\u00a0 Oxygen or use of a nebulizer for dogs with CRCoV\u00a0 Recovery and Management of Canine Coronavirus Most dogs will recover fully within two weeks from both the enteric and respiratory strains. However, dogs who have been hospitalized due to canine coronavirus may require one (or more) follow-up visits to the vet to assess their recovery progress.\u00a0\u00a0 Overall, the prognosis for both the enteric and respiratory forms of canine coronavirus is good, unless in severe cases or in young animals. Especially with early veterinary intervention and supportive care, most dogs quickly recover.\u00a0 Cleaning the environment, especially in shelters or large pack environments, is important to prevent canine coronavirus. Common disinfectants like bleach kill canine coronavirus. It is also important to quarantine symptomatic dogs to prevent the spread of either strain of canine coronavirus to other dogs.\u00a0\u00a0 Prevention of Canine Coronavirus Although there is a vaccine for canine enteric coronavirus, most veterinarians do not recommend administering it, because it\u2019s not been proven effective at preventing the virus. There are, however, vaccines for other types CIRD that are considered part of the standard recommended vaccines by the American Animal Hospital Association.\u00a0 Featured Image: iStock.com/GoodLifeStudio"}]
