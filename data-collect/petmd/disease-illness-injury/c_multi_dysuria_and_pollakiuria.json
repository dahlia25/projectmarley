While the urinary bladder and urethra normally serve to store and release the urine, these two disorders affect the lower urinary tract by damaging the bladder wall or stimulating the nerve endings in the bladder or urethra. In other words, you&#039;ll have a pet that goes to the bathroom often, and it may even have pain or discomfort when it urinates. The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library. Symptoms     Extreme irritability    Discomfort  or pain during urination    Frequent &quot;accidents&quot; occuring indoors after he has been housebrokenCauses Dysuria and pollakiuria are generally caused by lesions, stones, cancer or trauma in the urinary bladder and/or urethra. (Lesions and stones are good indicators of a lower urinary tract disease.) Other factors include: For the Urinary Bladder     Anatomic abnormalities    Malfunction of bladder muscles    Chemicals/drugs    Medical proceduresFor the Urethra     Anatomic abnormalities    Kidney stones    Urethral plugs    Increased tension of the urethral sphincter (muscle used to control urine flow)    Medical proceduresFor the Prostrate Gland     Cancer    Inflammation or abscess    Cysts\u00a0 \u00a0  Diagnosis After establishing a thorough medical and behavioral history on the dog, the veterinarian will be able to rule out a variety of causes, such as surgical procedures, spraying or marking territory, and drug usage. Once those are ruled out, the veterinarian will run tests (i.e., blood, urine, etc.) to determine which of the causes listed above is affecting your pet.  Treatment Dogs with less serious, nonobstructive lower urinary tract diseases are typically seen on an outpatient basis, while others requires hospitalization. Treatment mainly depends on the underlying cause of the condition(s). But if an illness has led to dysuria and/or pollakiuria, it will include supportive therapies, along with any medication to help with the symptoms. However, these conditions often clear up rapidly after proper treatment has been given."}]
