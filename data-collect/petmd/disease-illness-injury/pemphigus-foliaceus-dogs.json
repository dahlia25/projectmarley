In this article, Dr. Michael Kearley discusses the causes, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment options for pemphigus foliaceus in dogs.", "articleBody": "What Is Pemphigus Foliaceus in Dogs? Pemphigus foliaceus is the most common autoimmune skin disease in dogs, although it remains rare. An autoimmune disease occurs when the immune system\u2014responsible for protecting the body and defending against foreign invaders like bacteria or viruses\u2014becomes dysfunctional. Instead of fighting off foreign invaders, it starts to attack itself, targeting specific proteins or cells.\u00a0 In the case of pemphigus foliaceus, the body targets desmosomes, which are proteins that hold skin cells together.\u00a0 This leads to the development of cracks, fissures, pustules (pimples filled with pus), scaling, and infection. Although it\u2019s not considered a medical emergency, untreated cases of pemphigus foliaceus can result in serious infections, leading to pain and a poor quality of life. Therefore, treatment should be given as soon as possible.\u00a0 Symptoms of Pemphigus Foliaceus in Dogs Pemphigus foliaceus primarily affects the skin, resulting in a range of skin-related symptoms. The hallmark symptom is the presence of pustules, which are reddish, yellow, or brown raised lesions, like pimples. These pustules can occur as single or multiple clusters, which can become much larger, deeper, and more painful with time. These sores typically appear on the face first and can spread to the head, ears, neck, trunk, groin, and feet. This condition usually has a symmetrical distribution, occurring on both sides of the body. Other symptoms associated with pemphigus foliaceus in dogs may include: Scales and crusts on the skin Hair loss Itching and scratching (pruritus) Depigmentation of the nose or lips Fever Lethargy Decreased appetite Weight loss Pain Causes of Pemphigus Foliaceus in Dogs  While dogs of any breed and age can develop pemphigus foliaceus, it seems to be more prevalent in middle-aged dogs of certain breeds, suggesting a possible genetic component to the disease. These breeds include: Akitas Chow Chows Cocker Spaniels Collies Dachshunds Dobermans Newfoundlands Shar-Pei Pemphigus foliaceus also occurs more frequently in dogs with a history of chronic skin disease, such as allergies and other environmental factors, as well as in dogs with concurrent illness or autoimmune disease.\u00a0 Pemphigus foliaceus is primarily classified as an autoimmune disease, and in many cases its cause is idiopathic (unknown). Some cases have been linked to the use of certain medications, such as antibiotics, and are classified as an adverse drug reaction. How Veterinarians Diagnose Pemphigus Foliaceus in Dogs Because symptoms and skin lesions can often be caused by other diseases, your vet will most likely recommend a few basic bedside tests. These may include: A skin impression to look for abnormal skin cells and a secondary bacterial and/or yeast infection (pyoderma) Skin scraping to look for external parasites such as mites Some type of fungal test (culture/PCR/Wood\u2019s lamp) to look for ringworm Your vet may also recommend testing your dog\u2019s blood to rule out other conditions and establish a baseline prior to initiating drug therapy. This may be recommended because the medications prescribed often cause elevated organ values.\u00a0 Ultimately, diagnosis of pemphigus foliaceus requires a biopsy with histopathology. This means that your vet may remove several skin samples, often under local sedation or general anesthesia, and submit them for analysis to look for evidence of acantholytic skin cells (skin cells not connected to one another). Your vet may recommend treatment of the secondary skin infection first for a few days prior to obtaining a biopsy, as pyoderma can complicate the diagnostic process. Treatment of Pemphigus Foliaceus There are two treatment goals for all patients with pemphigus foliaceus: Control the disease. Induce remission as soon as possible. Because pemphigus foliaceus occurs due to a dysfunctional immune system, treatment consists of suppressing the immune functions with prescription medications called immunosuppressants. Steroids, at high doses, are the most prescribed drug and the most effective, but they possess many negative and unappealing side effects, such as: An increased thirst and urination Gastrointestinal upset and ulceration Lethargy Increased risk of infection Increased risk of developing certain endocrinopathies (hormone-related disorders) Toxicity to the liver Bone marrow suppression To minimize or avoid these side effects, other immunosuppressive drugs like azathioprine, chlorambucil, mycophenolate, or cyclosporine are used in conjunction with steroids.\u00a0 Additionally, steroids and the other drugs are slowly decreased over time, usually after several months, to the lowest effective dose where symptoms are controlled and side effects have ceased.\u00a0 It\u2019s important not to discontinue or alter the tapering regimen without speaking with your veterinarian, as symptoms will return, and medical emergencies can appear. Many dogs with pemphigus foliaceus also suffer from secondary bacterial and fungal infections and will often be prescribed antibiotics such as cephalexin, Clavamox\u00ae, or clindamycin, or antifungals such as fluconazole or miconazole.\u00a0\u00a0 Topical therapies, consisting of ointments, shampoos, or conditioners, are often prescribed, containing antibacterial, antifungal, and/or steroidal properties. Bathing your pet, under the direction of your vet, can improve symptoms and help make your dog more comfortable and less itchy. Fatty acids may improve your pup&#039;s skin coat quality, maintain their skin barrier, and reduce inflammation. A few helpful products may include:\u00a0 Additionally, diets aimed at strengthening the skin barrier, soothing, and nourishing the skin, and helping to support the immune system, such as Hill\u2019s Derm Defense, could be helpful to your dog.\u00a0 Speak with your veterinarian to determine the best topicals, supplements, and diet for your dog based on their specific medical and nutritional needs. Recovery and Management of Pemphigus Foliaceus The overall prognosis for dogs with pemphigus foliaceus is fair to good, with improvement generally seen within the first few months of treatment and complete remission of symptoms within about five months.\u00a0 Dogs will often need to return for a follow-up visit and stitches removal within the first month. Monthly (if not more frequent) follow-ups are needed thereafter to ensure that your pup is responding to treatment. Their vet will also need to monitor their drug levels, check your dog\u2019s blood and organ levels, and consider tapering of medications when needed.\u00a0 Unfortunately, not all dogs will fully recover from their symptoms and will require medication for life. Dogs that respond more quickly to the initial treatment may have a better chance of achieving long-term remission. It\u2019s important not to discontinue or alter the course of your dog\u2019s medications without speaking with your veterinarian. If this occurs, this can have significant side effects when not discontinued properly. Additionally, dogs who do go into remission can relapse at any time.\u00a0 Because treatment is not without risks and side effects, pay close attention to your dog\u2019s behavior and appetite. Changes can signal the need for medical attention, resulting in a quicker and safer recovery for your pup. Prevention of Pemphigus Foliaceus  Pemphigus foliaceus can\u2019t be prevented, but adhering to the follow-up recommendations and guidelines of your veterinarian can help prevent recurrences or flare-ups in the future.\u00a0 Medications, including vaccinations, should be given with caution, or avoided altogether, as they have the potential to worsen the condition by triggering the immune system."}]
