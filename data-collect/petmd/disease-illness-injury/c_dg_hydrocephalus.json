Hydrocephalus is abnormal expansion and accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in cavities inside the brain. CSF is the liquid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord to support and cushion those delicate tissues and also provide nutrients to keep them healthy. CSF is normally produced in cavities in the brain and is eventually absorbed by the body as it performs its essential functions.\u00a0\u00a0 In hydrocephalus, the abnormal buildup of CSF can be due to:\u00a0 Increased production of CSF\u00a0 Decreased absorption of CSF\u00a0 A blockage of CSF within the brain\u00a0 This accumulation of fluid creates pressure on the brain. Because the skull prevents the brain to expand, and as a result of the pressure, significant damage to the brain can occur, resulting in behavioral and neurological issues. Possible complications include brain herniation and even death.\u00a0\u00a0 Hydrocephalus is an extremely complex disease that veterinarians and researchers have yet to completely determine the underlying mechanisms behind. However, in general, hydrocephalus is broken down into two major types: congenital and acquired. Dogs with congenital hydrocephalus are born with the condition, while dogs with acquired hydrocephalus are born with normal brains but develop abnormal fluid accumulation over time.\u00a0\u00a0 Symptoms of Hydrocephalus in Dogs Hydrocephalus can cause a wide variety of symptoms in dogs depending on the specific cause and area of the brain that\u2019s affected. Some dogs are asymptomatic.\u00a0\u00a0 Symptoms may be acute or gradually progress and can include:\u00a0\u00a0 Difficulty training and decreased awareness or lack of response to stimuli\u00a0 Visual deficits, often blindness\u00a0 Abnormal gaze (eyes fixed down and away)\u00a0 Seizures\u00a0 Head pressing\u00a0 Large, dome-shaped head, often with congenital hydrocephalus and with open fontanelles (the soft spot on the top of the skull)\u00a0 Brain dysfunction\u00a0 Abnormal behavior\u2014inappropriate vocalization, over excitability, drowsiness, circling\u00a0 Gait abnormalities\u00a0 Increased intracranial pressure, often leading to stupor or coma\u00a0 Causes of Hydrocephalus in Dogs Congenital hydrocephalus is one of the most common types of the disease. Congenital means \u201cborn with,\u201d but does not necessarily have a genetic cause. There are numerous malformations within the brain that can cause obstruction of the CSF. Common causes of congenital hydrocephalus are:\u00a0 Genetic malformation\u00a0 Prenatal infection (often due to the parainfluenza virus)\u00a0 Exposure to substances that are toxic to a developing fetus\u00a0 Brain hemorrhage secondary to a difficult birth\u00a0 Prenatal vitamin deficiency\u00a0 Unfortunately, veterinarians cannot always determine a cause of congenital hydrocephalus. Veterinarians do, however, commonly diagnose congenital hydrocephalus with other malformations such as:\u00a0\u00a0 An abnormality of the skull and vertebra at the base of the skull creating inadequate space for the brain to function\u00a0 An underdeveloped part of the brain called the cerebellum associated with cyst formation and subsequent fluid accumulation\u00a0 Abnormal cavities within the spinal cord\u00a0 A type of spina bifida\u00a0 Certain cysts within the nervous system\u00a0 Acquired hydrocephalus results when a previously normal brain develops an obstruction and subsequent dilation with CSF. Causes of acquired hydrocephalus include:\u00a0\u00a0 Tumors\u00a0 Infection\u00a0 Trauma\u00a0 Brain hemorrhage\u00a0 Inflammatory brain disease\u00a0 How Veterinarians Diagnose Hydrocephalus in Dogs A vet may suspect hydrocephalus based on a physical exam alone. The veterinarian will examine the dog\u2019s appearance and interactions with and response to stimuli. A dog with an enlarged dome-like head, open fontanelle (soft spot on the skull), and eyes positioned down and out are often evaluated for hydrocephalus.\u00a0\u00a0 X-Ray\u00a0 The vet may take x-rays to view your dog\u2019s skull, and to determine if there are open plates and other signs suggesting hydrocephalus.\u00a0\u00a0 Ultrasound\u00a0 If your dog has an open fontanelle, the vet may perform an ultrasound to visualize the dilated chambers within the brain.\u00a0\u00a0 CT and/or MRI\u00a0 These imaging tests can provide a definitive diagnosis of hydrocephalus because they provide crucial information about internal brain structure and function that cannot be determined other ways.\u00a0 In some instances, the vet may also perform electroencephalography (EEG), which detects electrical activity in the dog\u2019s brain and a cerebrospinal fluid analysis, which measures chemicals in the dog\u2019s spinal fluid. Treatment of Hydrocephalus in Dogs Treatment of hydrocephalus involves addressing the underlying cause. Not all forms of hydrocephalus return to a \u201cnormal\u201d state, but the goal is to stop progression of disease. Age, severity, and severity of symptoms all play a role in developing a treatment plan for a dog with hydrocephalus.\u00a0\u00a0 Medicine to decrease production of cerebral spinal fluid is often the first treatment option, especially in dogs with mild to moderate disease. The most common medicine used to accomplish this are:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Steroids such as prednisolone and dexamethasone\u00a0 Diuretics such as furosemide\u00a0 Proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole\u00a0 In severe cases or those that don\u2019t respond to medications, the vet may suggest neurosurgery as a treatment option. Surgery typically involves implanting a shunt to remove fluid from the brain and relocating it to another location in the body, usually the abdominal cavity. Surgery has a 50% to 90% success rate in animals with hydrocephalus.\u00a0 If a dog is having seizures, the vet may administer valium and then prescribe other treatments such as antibiotics, surgery, or steroids, once the dog is stable.\u00a0\u00a0 Recovery and Management of Hydrocephalus in Dogs Long-term medical management of hydrocephalus with steroids and diuretics may lead to Cushing\u2019s disease and electrolyte imbalances. It is important to maintain the recommended follow-up maintenance exams with the vet to closely monitor your dog\u2019s health.\u00a0\u00a0 Dogs who have surgery to place a shunt may require additional procedures to address blockages in the shunt.\u00a0\u00a0 Dogs with mild cases of hydrocephalus may lead normal lives with minimal medical intervention. However, more severe cases can have a poor prognosis as the disease progresses and can eventually lead to brain herniation, seizures, and even death. In general, approximately 50% of the animals respond favorably to treatment, both medical and surgical.\u00a0\u00a0"}]
