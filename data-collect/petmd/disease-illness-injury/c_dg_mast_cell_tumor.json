Mast cell tumors are generally diagnosed in dogs over eight years old and are more common in boxers Bulldogs hugs and Boston terriers. Symptoms of massive tumors vary and can be dependent on the location and the grade of the tumor General symptoms include tumors on or under the skin that appear to fluctuate in size or grow rapidly and have been present for days up to months.\n\nSymptoms also include tumors that are located on the trunk of the body or the extremities such as a pot. A small percentage of muscle tumors are found on the head and neck of the body as well. These masses may be itchy or inflamed and they can cause vomiting loss of appetite or diarrhea, depending on the stage of the disease stage one of the disease is characterized by a single tumor without metastasis while later stages can be characterized by multiple tumors and a spread of the disease to the organs or blood to diagnose a massive tumor your veterinarian will perform a fine needle aspirin to examine the cells of the tumor and determine the amount of abnormal mast cells in the blood.\n\nIf any a surgical biopsy will also be needed to identify the grade of the tumor, as well as the stage. The disease is in your vet Neary and they also use X-ray and ultrasound images to determine the exact location of the tumor. Surgical removal of the mast cell tumor and surrounding tissue is generally the recommended treatment. If the lymph nodes have been impacted follow up chemotherapy after surgery may be required to prevent further disease spread.\n\nIf the tumor cannot be operated on or if the tumor cells spread to other parts of the body. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be recommended to reduce the size of the tumor. Your vet Noreen will recommend evaluation of any new masses and require regular checkups to make sure the tumors have not spread and to monitor your dog's blood count, especially if your dog is receiving chemotherapy.", "potentialAction": {"@type": "SeekToAction", "target": "https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/cancer/c_dg_mast_cell_tumor?wtime={seek_to_second_number}", "startOffset-input": "required name=seek_to_second_number"}}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "BreadcrumbList", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 0, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.petmd.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Diseases A-Z", "item": "https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "FAQPage", "mainEntity": [{"@type": "Question", "name": "What is the survival rate for dogs with mast cell tumors?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Survival rate\u00a0depends\u00a0on the grade of the mast cell tumor.

Mast\u00a0cell\u00a0tumors\u00a0are the most common\u00a0form of skin cancer\u00a0found\u00a0in dogs.\u00a0Located in connective tissue throughout the body, mast cells are\u00a0white blood cells that are\u00a0part of the immune system.\u00a0They\u00a0are\u00a0responsible for\u00a0the allergic response.\u00a0\u00a0 Mast cells\u00a0become\u00a0cancerous\u00a0when they begin dividing abnormally\u00a0and\u00a0grow into\u00a0tumors.\u00a0Mast cells\u00a0tumors\u00a0are easily mistaken\u00a0for other skin lesions, like warts or benign lumps. They\u00a0can appear in any\u00a0shape, firmness, size,\u00a0or\u00a0location. In most cases, however,\u00a0they are\u00a0firm, solitary, slow-growing masses of the skin.\u00a0In some cases, mast cell tumors can also cause severe allergic (anaphylactic) reactions in dogs.\u00a0 Because they are so good at mimicking other skin conditions, it\u2019s usually impossible to identify a mast cell tumor just by looking\u00a0at it, even for your veterinarian.\u00a0They are more common on middle-aged dogs, and certain\u00a0breeds\u00a0like Boxers and Boston Terriers are more susceptible, so it\u2019s always a good idea to have your vet look at any unusual skin masses that appear on your dog.\u00a0 Symptoms of Mast Cell Tumors Mast cell tumors may not cause any symptoms at all.\u00a0To help prevent more serious disease, vets recommend checking your dog every few months to look for any masses on the skin.\u00a0Make an appointment to see your vet if you find:\u00a0\u00a0 A\u00a0new skin\u00a0mass\u00a0 A\u00a0known mass that has changed in size or color\u00a0 An unexplained allergic reaction or hive\u00a0 Some\u00a0masses\u00a0may\u00a0appear small and easily movable in (or just under) the skin with little swelling.\u00a0More aggressive tumors\u00a0can appear\u00a0as\u00a0larger, hairless\u00a0sores.\u00a0 In some cases, however, a mast cell tumor will result in symptoms, including strong allergic reactions\u00a0triggered by the activated immune system. Also, if a\u00a0tumor\u00a0is\u00a0bumped or agitated,\u00a0it may\u00a0go through a process called\u00a0\u201cdegranulation.\u201d\u00a0This means\u00a0the tumor\u00a0releases\u00a0all\u00a0its\u00a0inflammatory\u00a0material\u00a0at once.\u00a0Degranulation\u00a0can cause symptoms such as swelling and redness in the affected area or\u00a0a more severe anaphylactic reaction that includes:\u00a0 Weakness\u00a0 Nausea\u00a0 Vomiting\u00a0 Diarrhea\u00a0 Swelling of the face and limbs\u00a0 Collapse and\u00a0death (rarely)\u00a0\u00a0 Causes of Mast Cell Tumors in Dogs The underlying causes of mast cells tumors are not known. Like other types of cancer,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0likely they are caused by a mix of genetic and environmental factors,\u00a0but we\u00a0do not\u00a0have enough information to recommend any\u00a0changes to your dog\u2019s environment to prevent mast cells tumors.\u00a0\u00a0 Certain breeds, however, are more\u00a0likely to get mast cell tumors. These include:\u00a0\u00a0 Boxers\u00a0 Pugs\u00a0 Pit Bull / Bull Terrier\u00a0 Boston\u00a0Terrier\u00a0 Bulldogs\u00a0 Retriever breeds\u00a0(such as Golden Retriever)\u00a0 Rhodesian\u00a0Ridgeback\u00a0 Weimaraner\u00a0 Schnauzer\u00a0 How Do Vets Diagnose Mast Cell Tumors? Your veterinarian will likely recommend creating a skin chart of all known masses and then\u00a0taking\u00a0a\u00a0tissue\u00a0sample using a fine needle aspiration (FNA)\u00a0or performing\u00a0a biopsy on the more concerning masses. Many veterinarians will be able to initially identify mast cell tumors by a fine needle aspirate.\u00a0\u00a0 Fine needle aspiration is a simple procedure and usually\u00a0does\u00a0not\u00a0require sedation.\u00a0It involves\u00a0placing a needle\u00a0in\u00a0the mass\u00a0to suction\u00a0out some tissue. Once a few cells are collected,\u00a0they can be looked at under a microscope and the initial diagnosis can be made\u00a0by a specially trained veterinarian pathologist.\u00a0\u00a0 At the time of diagnosis, the mast cell tumor will be graded based on how aggressive it is.\u00a0Low-grade tumors\u00a0are less aggressive, while\u00a0high-grade\u00a0tumors are more aggressive. Tumors that are more aggressive are more likely to spread (metastasize) to other locations outside of the original tumor.\u00a0\u00a0 Treating Mast Cell Tumors Once diagnosed,\u00a0mast\u00a0cell\u00a0tumors are usually surgically removed\u00a0and sent to a\u00a0pathologist for review to determine if the tumor is\u00a0low grade (less aggressive cancer) or high grade (more aggressive cancer). This is\u00a0important\u00a0because treatment recommendations between low-\u00a0and high-grade\u00a0tumors are very different.\u00a0\u00a0 Roughly 80% of mast cells are low-\u00a0to intermediate-grade and\u00a0unlikely to reoccur\u00a0after surgery. This means that for\u00a0a majority of\u00a0mast cell tumors surgical removal can be curative.\u00a0\u00a0 High-grade masses\u00a0can spread aggressively to the lymph nodes and internal organs. For these cases,\u00a0your veterinarian may recommend additional testing such as lymph node aspirates and chest\u00a0x-rays. They may also recommend\u00a0consulting\u00a0with an oncologist\u00a0about chemotherapy or radiation therapy.\u00a0\u00a0 In some situations when surgery is not an option, veterinarians can\u00a0use a needle for radiation\u00a0therapy, but not dogs are good candidates for non-surgical treatments.\u00a0 Recovering from Mast Cell Tumors Recovering from\u00a0surgical removal of a\u00a0low-grade\u00a0mast\u00a0cell\u00a0tumor usually\u00a0requires\u00a02 weeks of rest, pain medications, antihistamines like Benadryl, and\u00a0wearing\u00a0an e-collar (\u201ccone of shame\u201d). After 2 weeks,\u00a0your veterinarian will remove\u00a0the sutures\u00a0and your dog can resume\u00a0normal activity.\u00a0\u00a0 For several months after\u00a0surgery,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0important\u00a0to\u00a0watch the area\u00a0where the mass was removed\u00a0to see if it comes back, although recurrence is unlikely for\u00a0most low-grade tumors. Surgery in most cases is curative, and a dog\u00a0usually will be able to live\u00a0their\u00a0natural lifespan.\u00a0 For high-grade tumors,\u00a0recovery\u00a0after\u00a0surgery will be the same, but your\u00a0veterinarian will\u00a0likely suggest\u00a0pursuing\u00a0additional\u00a0treatment such as radiation or chemotherapy\u00a0to prevent any tumors or cancer cells that have spread from causing more problems.\u00a0\u00a0 Survival with radiation or chemotherapy\u00a0usually\u00a0ranges\u00a0from\u00a010 months to 2 years, depending on the tumor and the therapy. Without any treatment, survival\u00a0averages about 4 months.\u00a0"}]
