Demodectic mange, also known as red mange, is a parasitic skin infection caused by mites such as Demodex canis (most common), Demodex injai, or Demodex cornei. Under the microscope, it appears cigar-shaped with eight short legs.\u00a0\u00a0 This type of mite is a normal inhabitant of the hair follicle, though it is usually not harmful. If the immune system is healthy, these mites cause no harm to their host. Dogs with immature or compromised immune systems that allow this mite to overgrow will develop clinical signs such as hair loss and red, scaling skin lesions.\u00a0 The mite normally lives in low numbers in the hair follicles of the skin. Demodex is most often transmitted from mother to puppy while suckling milk because of the pup\u2019s immature immune system.\u00a0 Exposure of a normal, healthy dog to one with demodex is not dangerous. Demodectic mange is not contagious between other dogs as it requires a depressed immune system to develop.\u00a0\u00a0 Demodectic mange cannot spread from dogs to humans.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Symptoms of Demodectic Mange in Dogs Clinical signs of demodectic mange include:\u00a0 Alopecia (hair loss)\u00a0 Skin scaling\u00a0 Bumps on the skin (papules)\u00a0 Pigmentation of the skin\u00a0 Thickening of the skin\u00a0 \u00a0Itchiness varies depending on secondary skin infections or if the lesions are localized to a certain area or are generalized over the body.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In puppies, lesions often begin around the face and head due to feeding from the mother\u2019s teat, but lesions can be found anywhere on the body. In more severe cases of generalized demodectic mange, pain, lethargy, fever, draining wounds, and skin swelling may be noted. Ear infections are also possible if the mite invades the ear canals. Causes of Demodectic Mange in Dogs Demodectic mites typically live on the skin and benefit from their host while causing no actual harm to their host. Mange occurs, when the mite overgrows at the hair follicle, often in those with weaker immune systems such as puppies, whose immune systems are still forming, and older dogs with underlying illnesses leading to depressed immune systems.\u00a0 Demodex lives on all our skin, even in normal healthy dogs and humans. When the immune system is depressed, it overgrows causing itching and mange. Normally this mite is only passed between dogs as puppies and is most often passed from mother to puppy.\u00a0\u00a0 How Veterinarians Diagnose Demodectic Mange in Dogs Mange is most commonly diagnosed through skin scraping or hair plucking, and cytology. This is a non-invasive test that involves using a scalpel blade and scraping the skin deep enough for mild irritation or bleeding to be noted (this is necessary since demodex lives deep in the hair follicle) or simply removing hair at the root for assessment. The sample is assessed under the microscope. The presence of any mites is considered a positive result.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some mites can be found through fecal flotation or fecal testing because the dog ingests them while licking/chewing the skin.\u00a0 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing can also be performed, but it can warrant false negative results and is often not necessary when diagnosis is evident.\u00a0 Finally, skin biopsy may be necessary in cases where the dog is not responding to therapy or if a diagnosis undetermined with other less invasive diagnostic tests. Biopsy is sometimes considered in more severe, generalized cases of demodex.\u00a0\u00a0 Treatment of Demodectic Mange in Dogs Not all cases of demodectic mange require treatment. Most cases of demodectic mange that are localized to a small region of the body will spontaneously resolve in 1-2 months with no treatment. Other cases of localized infections can be treated with topical medication such as moxidectin and imidacloprid.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If demodectic mange becomes generalized, medication is recommended for resolution of symptoms.\u00a0 Miticidal treatment (oral or topical) is the most common type of therapy, including ivermectin, milbemycin, doramectin, amitraz, fluralaner (Bravecto), afoxolaner (Nexgard), sarolaner (Simparica), and lotilaner (Credelio). Dogs with MDR1 mutations should never receive ivermectin. This mutation can be determined through genetic testing.\u00a0 Miticidal therapy is continued until two consecutive negative skin scraping or hair plucking tests occur.\u00a0 Special shampoos containing benzoyl peroxide are often recommended as these open and flush the hair follicles to allow dip and topical treatments to penetrate more efficiently. You should discuss the risks and benefits of these medications with your veterinarian before beginning to use them.\u00a0 Secondary skin infections due to inflammation can occur and require antibiotic therapy. It may be necessary to treat the skin infection before clearing the demodectic mange.\u00a0 It is also recommended to stop breeding dogs with generalized demodex infections as the disease is thought to have an underlying genetic and/or immune system cause that contributes to the overgrowth of mites.\u00a0 Recovery and Prevention of Demodectic Mange in Dogs Most dogs with mange recover well with appropriate therapy in a timely manner. Secondary infections and underlying systemic illness are often the culprits in dogs that require chronic treatment.\u00a0\u00a0 Mange can be fatal in dogs who receive inappropriate therapy or whose underlying medical conditions are not well managed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Demodectic mange does not require environmental cleaning as it does not typically transmit between dogs, though a monthly or tri-monthly miticidal preventative is still recommended. Dogs should remain on regular miticidal preventatives to avoid infection from other types of mites, fleas, and ticks unless otherwise directed by your veterinarian."}]
