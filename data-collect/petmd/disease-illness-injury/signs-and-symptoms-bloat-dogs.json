If you suspect your dog has bloat it's important to seek immediate veterinary care. The exact cause of bloat is not completely understood. A variety of factors, including genetics anatomy and environment are most likely to blame the condition is most commonly seen in large and giant brains especially deep chested breeds like Great Danes German shepherds and standard poodles.\n\nWhile bloat has been reported in puppies risk does increase with age. Other contributing factors may include overeating drinking too much water or strenuous activity after eating and drinking. Symptoms of bloat in dogs include swollen stomach excessive drooling and unproductive dry heaving. The discomfort may cause your dog to cry or whimpering pain rapid heartbeat labored breathing and pale gums may also indicate bloat.\n\nTo diagnose bloat your veterinarian may take an X-ray of your dog's abdomen since bloat is considered an extreme emergency condition that requires aggressive treatment. Your dog's heart may need to be stabilized first, then your vet may perform gastric decompression to relieve pressure once your dog is stabilized. Surgical measures may be taken to return the stomach to its normal position. In some cases, the stomach may be surgically secured to the wall of the abdomen to prevent recurrence post surgery.\n\nYour dog will be administered painkillers and other necessary medications and activity should be restricted for about two weeks to prevent bloat. Your dog should avoid rigorous exercise after eating and drinking. Feeding your dog several small meals a day rather than one or two large meals and slowing the rate of food consumption may also help. If you have a large or giant breed dog.\n\nTalk with your veterinarian about a simple surgical procedure called a gastro pixie which essentially tax the stomach to the abdominal wall to prevent the twisting action associated with GDPR.

She also discusses how to manage bloat with medication and when surgery is necessary.", "articleBody": "What Is Bloat in Dogs? Bloat is a condition in which food or gas stretches your dog\u2019s stomach, causing abdominal pain. While it is more common in large breed or deep-chested dogs, any breed can develop bloat. Depending on the severity, bloat can be fatal if not treated within an hour or two. \u00a0 The stomach is located in the upper abdomen and normally contains a small amount of gas, food, liquid, and mucus. When a dog eats, food enters the stomach from the esophagus, then is broken down by digestive enzymes. From the stomach, the food moves into the small intestine and down the gastrointestinal tract.\u00a0 When bloat occurs, your dog\u2019s stomach begins to expand, or distend, and cuts off blood flow to the abdomen as well as the stomach itself. This may cause injury (even death) of the stomach wall and, without treatment, eventually other organs. Bloat can also put pressure on the diaphragm, a thin muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen, leading to trouble breathing. \u00a0 In severe cases of bloat, a dog\u2019s stomach twists and fills with gas. This is called gastric dilatation and volvulus (GDV) and is considered one of the most painful, severe emergencies in veterinary medicine. This degree of bloat cuts off blood flow to the stomach and the lower half of the body, making it impossible for food to pass into the intestine. In extreme cases of GDV, a dog\u2019s stomach can rupture, and the spleen can also be injured.\u00a0 This is a very serious health emergency and, if untreated, a dog with GDV will die within hours.\u00a0 Is Bloat in Dogs Curable? All cases of bloat require immediate medical attention to determine the severity. If bloat is treated immediately, it is often curable. Simple bloat, where the dog\u2019s stomach has not twisted, can sometimes be managed without medication, but may require fluids or other treatments. Other degrees of bloat, including GDV, can also be curable if diagnosed in the early stages. These conditions are usually treated with immediate surgery. Symptoms of Bloat in Dogs Bloat is a very uncomfortable, often painful, health crisis for dogs. As a result, a dog with bloat may:\u00a0 Dry-heave (also called retching) without vomiting any food. Sometimes a dog might spit out white foam when trying to vomit, which is usually mucus from the esophagus or stomach. Have abdominal distention (this might not be visible in the early stages of bloat) Experience sudden anxiety, pacing, an inability to get comfortable or constantly moving around the room/house. Be guarding their belly or looking back at their belly Position themselves in downward facing dog pose, where the dog\u2019s back half is up and upper half is down Pant and drool Collapse Have a racing heartbeat (tachycardia) Have pale gums Causes of Bloat in Dogs It\u2019s unknown why bloat and GDV occur in dogs, but there are suspected risk factors that can increase the chance of bloat. \u00a0 While bloat can occur in any dog, risks factors that increase the chances of bloat in dogs are: Ingesting large amounts of food or water too quickly Weighing more than 99 pounds increases the risk by about 20%\u00a0 Age (Older dogs are at a higher risk) Being deep chested\u00a0 Exercise immediately after eating.\u00a0 Eating from an elevated food bowl Having a close relative that was diagnosed with bloat Eating dry food with fat or oil listed in the first 4 ingredients How Vets Diagnose Bloat in Dogs A veterinarian may suspect bloat and/or GDV by simply seeing a dog\u2019s distressed behavior and physical appearance, but they typically also perform tests to confirm the diagnosis.\u00a0 Blood Test The vet may perform a blood test to get a picture of your dog\u2019s overall health. \u00a0 Abdominal X-rays These are taken to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the severity of bloat. An x-ray can indicate if a dog has simple bloat, where the stomach appears very distended and round and is usually full of food or gas. \u00a0X-rays also show if bloat has progressed to GDV and the stomach appears very distended and has what looks like a bubble on top of the already swollen stomach. \u00a0 Treatment for Bloat in Dogs Treatment of simple bloat can be quite straightforward. Dogs are usually hospitalized to receive large amounts of intravenous fluids and sometimes medicine. They\u2019re also walked often to stimulate movement of the gastrointestinal tract to help move the gas and food quickly through the body. A dog with GDV requires more intense care that typically includes:\u00a0 Intravenous fluids with electrolytes to aggressively treat shock and improve circulation to vital organs. Pain medications and often antibiotics to treat discomfort, shock and any death of tissues from the loss of circulation. A procedure to decompress the stomach by removing gas from the stomach to allow blood flow to the lower half of the body. In some instances, this helps untwist the stomach. \u00a0 Electrocardiogram (ECG) to monitor for any heart abnormalities which frequently due to toxins from decreased circulation.\u00a0 Surgery is performed as soon as the dog is as stable as possible. Depending on the severity of bloat, a vet may have to untwist the dog\u2019s stomach and/or spleen, and remove any part of the stomach wall that may have died due to loss of blood flow. The vet will also stitch the stomach to the body wall in a procedure called a gastropexy. This significantly reduces the risk of rotation of the stomach in the future. \u00a0 Recovery and Management of Bloat in Dogs After proper diagnosis, dogs with simple bloat tend to bounce back into their normal lives and routines 1 to 2 days after receiving fluids and taking frequent walks.\u00a0 Following GDV surgery, a dog will remain in the hospital until pain is controlled, blood tests indicate normal enzyme levels, and the dog is eating and drinking well on their own. Length of time in the hospital depends on the dog\u2019s health history and severity of bloat, and may be anywhere from 1 to 2 days, to up to 7 or more. Regardless of the type of bloat or treatment a dog experienced, vets suggest the same steps to lower the risk of bloat in the future: Never leave large bags or bins of food accessible to your dog to avoid overeating.\u00a0 Do not use raised food bowls unless advised by your veterinarian (some pets require a raised food bowl due to a medical condition) Wait at least 1 hour after a meal or drinking a large amount of water for any exercise or playtime. Feed small meals a few times throughout the day instead of 1 or 2 large meals Avoid gorging on water when drinking Discuss preventative surgery with your veterinarian for breeds at higher risk of bloat. This can often be performed during your pet\u2019s spay or neuter procedure."}]
