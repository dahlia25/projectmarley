Kidneys function to filter the blood. They remove waste products and control the flow of nutrients and fluids. Within the kidney, tiny tubules perform these tasks. Dogs have hundreds of thousands of them that keep glucose, amino acids, and electrolytes such as potassium and chloride in balance. Glucose and amino acids provide the energy needed to allow puppies to grow and keep dogs healthy. Electrolytes help control hydration, many metabolic processes, and keep the pH (acid-base status) of body tissues normal. \u00a0In dogs with Fanconi syndrome, these renal tubules are \u201cleaky\u201d and too much glucose, amino acids, and electrolytes are passed from the bloodstream into the urine. The leaking nutrients cause weight loss, muscle loss, and fatigue. Unbalanced electrolytes result in dehydration, weakness, and dangerous changes in the normal acid-base balance in the blood, known as pH. Fanconi syndrome is a chronic but usually manageable disease. If the disease is undiagnosed, untreated, or progresses into renal failure, it can be fatal. Any severe clinical signs or worsening of symptoms should be considered a medical emergency. Symptoms of Fanconi Syndrome in Dogs Excessive urination Extreme thirst/drinking Weight loss Decreased appetite Poor body condition Poor growth rates in young dogs Weakness or extreme tiredness Causes of Fanconi Syndrome in Dogs Fanconi syndrome in dogs can be genetic. About 75 percent of dogs with Fanconi syndrome are Basenjis; it\u2019s recommended to have genetic testing for this breed. Fanconi syndrome can also be caused by: Eating toxins (such as melamine, lead, copper, or salicylic acid)\u00a0\u00a0 Uncommon reactions or high doses of some medications Concurrent diseases, such as\u00a0hypoparathyroidism or low vitamin D How Veterinarians Diagnose Fanconi Syndrome in Dogs Veterinarians will start with a full physical exam and may recommend the following testing: Complete blood count Chemistry panel Blood gases Urinalysis Urine sample testing for the concentration of amino acids in urine Treatment of Fanconi Syndrome in Dogs Fanconi syndrome does not have a cure, but it can be managed with a dietary supplement such as mineral or amino acid supplements. Depending on lab work, special diets to adjust the amount of protein in the food may be needed.\u00a0 It\u2019s critical that dogs with Fanconi syndrome always have access to fresh water and that their health is closely monitored. If Fanconi syndrome is severe or progresses into renal failure, your dog many need to be hospitalized for IV fluid and electrolyte therapy. Recovery and Management of Fanconi Syndrome in Dogs The life expectancy of dogs with Fanconi syndrome varies. Some dogs can be managed well for years, but others do not respond and can progress quickly into renal failure. Dogs with Fanconi syndrome will benefit the most from careful monitoring by their families and their veterinarians. Dogs should always have fresh water available and be encouraged to drink frequently. Any new symptoms, such as weakness, weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, refusal to eat, or changes in urination need to be evaluated by your veterinarian."}]
