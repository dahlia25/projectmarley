He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC). \u00a0 Blood testing may reveal an increased number of platelets as well as white blood cells (leukocytosis), anemia with abnormally large, pale red blood cells (RBCs),\u00a0 abnormally-shaped RBCs called poikilocytes (poikilcytosis), and a variation in RBC color (polychromasia). The biochemistry profile, meanwhile, may show an excess of iron in the blood (hyperferremia), mild increase in bilirubin, and slight increase in liver enzymes. Lastly, urinalysis may reveal high levels of bilirubin.   Treatment \u00a0 Bone marrow transplantation is the only available treatment for PK deficient dogs. However, this treatment is expensive and potentially life-threatening. \u00a0 Living and Management \u00a0 Dogs that undergo a bone marrow transplant may have a normal lifespan. Unfortunately, those that are left untreated will typically die by four years of age as a result of bone marrow or liver failure. Most of these patients develop severe anemia and accumulation of fluid in abdominal cavity (ascites) during the terminal stage of the disease."}]
