The palate is the roof of your dog\u2019s mouth. A cleft palate is an opening along the middle of the palate. This opening can range from small (a few millimeters) to severe (the entire length of the hard and soft palate). This results in a lack of tissue connection between the mouth and nasal passages, creating problems for the dog that include eating, difficulty nursing, and poor growth. \u00a0 Symptoms of Cleft Palate in Dogs Symptoms of a cleft palate in dogs can be easy to notice and even visible. Cleft palate in dogs can also create various health issues due to its structure. These symptoms can include:\u00a0 Difficulty nursing: Puppies with a cleft palate are unable to create enough suction when nursing because the oral cavity is open to the nasal cavity. The milk or food the dog does manage to get travels from the mouth to the nose, causing sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal irritation (also known as rhinitis), regurgitation, and gagging.\u00a0 Poor growth: Without the ability to nurse and eat normally, many puppies and dogs with cleft palate do not get proper nutrition and can be lethargic, with a poor rate of growth.\u00a0 Aspiration pneumonia: Breathing in food and water can cause an infection of the lungs. Depending on your dog\u2019s age, this may result in a cough and a fever, then develop into lethargy, difficulty breathing, and possibly death.\u00a0\u00a0 Facial deformity: Occasionally, dogs with cleft palate will also have a facial deformity, such as cleft lip.\u00a0 Other issues: Though they are not always apparent at first, and depend on the cause of the cleft palate, problems with the inner ear, middle ear, swallowing apparatus, nasal septum, sinuses, and teeth may develop.\u00a0 Causes of Cleft Palate in Dogs There are two types of cleft palate in dogs:\u00a0 Congenital cleft palate is present at birth if the palate fails to fuse properly during days 25-28 of gestation. This can occur for a variety of reasons:\u00a0 Genes: Most congenital cleft palates are genetic. Therefore, dogs with any level of cleft palate should be spayed or neutered and not used for breeding purposes.\u00a0Nutrition: Cleft palates can occur with too much dietary vitamin A or a lack of folic acid during pregnancy.\u00a0 Medications: Most notably, steroids, aspirin, griseofulvin, and some anti-seizure medications during pregnancy can cause cleft palate in puppies.\u00a0 Viruses: If the mother is exposed to certain viruses at a specific time during pregnancy, her puppies may be born with cleft palate.\u00a0 Acquired cleft palate is a new defect that appears in a previously normal palate. Causes may include:\u00a0 Trauma, such as gunshot injuries, bite wounds, thermal/electric burns, or blunt-force trauma\u00a0 Periodontal disease\u00a0 Foreign bodies in the mouth\u00a0 Cancer\u00a0 Dog Breeds That Are Prone to Cleft Palate Purebred dogs, especially brachycephalic breeds (dogs that have short muzzles and flat faces), are more likely to have a cleft palate. Some common brachycephalic breeds predisposed to cleft palates include Boston terriers, Pekingese, Boxers, and Bulldogs. Other breeds that may have congenital cleft palate include:\u00a0\u00a0 Miniature schnauzers\u00a0\u00a0 Beagles\u00a0 Cocker spaniels\u00a0 Dachshunds\u00a0 Brittany spaniels\u00a0 Shih tzus\u00a0 Great Pyrenees\u00a0 Nova Scotia duck tolling retrievers\u00a0 While there may be a genetic link in some of these breeds, there are other causes, and cleft palate can happen to both purebred and non-purebred dogs.\u00a0 How Veterinarians Diagnose Cleft Palate in Dogs Most commonly, veterinarians diagnose a cleft palate based on a physical exam, especially in newborn puppies. Older animals may need to be sedated for the exam, which involves a thorough oral inspection, looking for communication between the nasal and oral cavity.\u00a0 Other abnormalities will be evaluated at this point, paying special attention to the lungs for signs of pneumonia or infection. Your vet may use radiographs to check for abnormalities of the skull, nasal sinuses, membranes, and oral and nasal cavities, as well problems with the inner and middle ear and the teeth.\u00a0 Vets may use additional imaging techniques, such as MRI and CT. Biopsy and histopathology can be used in cases of acquired cleft palate caused by infections or tumors. Treatment of Cleft Palate in Dogs Most cases of congenital and acquired cleft palate require surgical correction by board-certified veterinary dentists and surgeons. A small number of acquired clefts may be able to heal on their own.\u00a0 Most dogs with cleft palate will require numerous surgeries, but the first is the most important because scar tissue can affect future surgeries. There are a variety of techniques surgeons use depending on the size, location (hard vs. soft palate), and severity of the cleft.\u00a0\u00a0 The goal of surgery is to re-establish separate oral and nasal cavities and to reconstruct the nasal cavity floor. This is most commonly done using a \ufffcflap technique, which involves relocating existing, healthy tissue in the mouth to cover the deformity.\u00a0 Less common surgical strategies include:\u00a0 Stem cells\u00a0 Bone grafts\u00a0 Prostheses\u00a0 Platelet-rich plasma injected at the surgical site\u00a0 Management of Cleft Palate in Dogs Newborn puppies with cleft palate commonly require tube-feeding before they are old enough for surgery, usually past 8-12 weeks. This will decrease the chance of aspiration pneumonia and ensure that the puppy receives adequate nutrition. Older dogs should eat small, meatball-sized dog food to decrease the chances of preoperative aspiration pneumonia.\u00a0\u00a0 All active infections must be treated before surgery. Dogs with chronic rhinitis or pneumonia may require oral or IV antibiotics before and after surgery. Proper pain medications will also be prescribed in the postoperative period.\u00a0 Dehiscence\u2014the surgical site breaking down\u2014is a common postsurgical complication. Many surgical sites break open due to tension at the surgery site, lack of space in the mouth, trauma during surgery, and trauma after surgery from eating or chewing. Hard food and chew toys must be avoided for a few weeks after surgery to allow proper wound healing. Dogs should be fed a diet with a thick liquid consistency during this time. Postoperative rechecks should be scheduled with the surgeon, typically at 2 - 4 week intervals.\u00a0 Dogs that suffer from chronic rhinitis may still have flare-ups and require medications to manage the condition, even after surgery. However, with a successful surgery and a healed palate, the prognosis for these dogs is positive."}]
