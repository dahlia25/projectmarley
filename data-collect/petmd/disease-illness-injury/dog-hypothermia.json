Simply put, hypothermia describes the situation where a dog\u2019s body temperature is significantly lower than normal. The drop in body temperature must be dramatic enough to put the dog\u2019s well-being at risk, however. Being cold isn\u2019t the same as being hypothermic. What Is a Normal Body Temperature for a Dog? The average body temperature for dogs is warmer than what is normal for people\u2014around 101.5 \u02daF, give or take a degree (100.5-102.5\u00b0F or 38-39.2\u00b0C). When Is a Dog\u2019s Temperature Too Low? When a dog\u2019s body temperature drops to around 98\u02daF or 99\u02daF (37\u00b0C), hypothermia is setting in. Symptoms of Dog Hypothermia Initially, a dog\u2019s body responds to hypothermia by narrowing blood vessels near the surface to send blood away from the skin, legs, ears, feet, etc., and towards essential organs like the brain and the heart. Here are the symptoms of hypothermia in dogs, from mild to severe. Signs of mild to moderate hypothermia in dogs include: Shivering Muscle stiffness Lethargy Difficulty walking Pale gums Cool body surfaces Confusion As hypothermia worsens, dogs will: Stop shivering Collapse Have fixed and dilated pupils Develop slow and irregular heart and breathing rates Become comatose Potentially die Mild Hypothermia At this point, you may notice that a hypothermic dog\u2019s extremities (ears, legs, feet, paws) appear somewhat pale and feel cool to the touch. While this physiological response can certainly help a dog survive, it does increase the risk that they\u2019ll suffer from frostbite as time goes on. Look for: Cold areas of the body, especially the extremities (ears, legs, feet, paws) Moderate Hypothermia To generate extra heat, a dog with mild to moderate hypothermia will shiver, and their muscles will become tense. This muscular activity produces warmth, but it can also make a dog\u2019s movements stiff and clumsy. At this point, a hypothermic dog may become sluggish and seem confused. Look for: Shivering Stiff or clumsy movements; difficulty walking Sluggishness Seeming confused Pale gums Severe Hypothermia As severe hypothermia sets in, a dog will stop shivering because their muscle cells have run out of energy. Once shivering stops, the dog\u2019s body temperature may begin to rapidly drop. The chemical reactions that are necessary for normal body functioning in a dog will slow down or stop altogether. The dog\u2019s heart rate slows and becomes erratic, and their breathing slows. As oxygen levels drop in the bloodstream, the dog will become increasingly lethargic and unresponsive. Eventually shock, organ failure, coma, and death will follow. Look for: Shivering that has stopped Rapid drop in body temperature Slower breathing Collapsing Lethargic and/or unresponsive Fixed and dilated pupils Causes of Dog Hypothermia Exposure to cold temperatures is the most obvious cause of hypothermia in dogs, particularly if it\u2019s also windy or the dog becomes damp, but there are other causes of dog hypothermia as well. Hypothermia and Cold Weather Certain dogs are at higher risk for exposure-related hypothermia than others. These include elderly dogs, puppies, small dogs, and dogs who have short or thin coats or are unused to cold temperatures. All these factors, especially in combination, make it harder for dogs to keep themselves warm when temperatures drop. Hypothermia and Anesthesia/Surgery Veterinarians often have to take measures to prevent or treat hypothermia in dogs who are in the hospital for anesthesia and surgery.1 Drugs and procedures used to anesthetize dogs can lead to increased heat loss through the skin and respiratory tract and reduce the body\u2019s ability to respond appropriately. Surgery can result in more heat loss because: The dog\u2019s coat is shaved The dog\u2019s skin is cleaned with cool antiseptic solutions The dog is laid on cold surgery tables Cool intravenous fluids are administered Internal organs are exposed to the air Hypothermia and Sick or Injured Dogs Sick and injured dogs are also at increased risk for become hypothermic. Health problems like kidney disease, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, some types of poisonings, and bleeding due to trauma can all lead to heat loss and/or the inability to regulate body temperature. How Vets Diagnose Dog Hypothermia The diagnosis of hypothermia is based on a dog\u2019s body temperature. Using a rectal thermometer provides the most accurate measurements. Any dog with a rectal temperature of under 98-99\u02daF (37\u00b0C) is hypothermic and requires treatment. If a thermometer is unavailable, a vet can look at the dog\u2019s symptoms to make a reasonable guess as to whether hypothermia is a likely diagnosis. Treatment for Dog Hypothermia Dogs with hypothermia need to be rewarmed, but the process should occur gradually. Think \u201cwarm,\u201d not \u201chot.\u201d Do not use a heating pad, as it gives off excessive heat that can lead to burns, or it can direct too much blood flow towards the skin, which can worsen shock. How to Slowly Warm a Hypothermic Dog Here\u2019s what to do if your dog has hypothermia: Get your dog into a warm building or vehicle. Wrap them in blankets, towels, coats, etc. If you can, warm up some blankets on a radiator, in a clothes dryer, or using a hairdryer. Place bottles of warm water next to your dog, but always keep a couple layers of fabric between the bottle and your dog\u2019s skin. Get to the nearest veterinary office immediately. Veterinary Treatment for Hypothermia in Dogs Once your dog is at the clinic, the veterinarian can employ more aggressive warming techniques. Hypothermic dogs can be given warmed intravenous fluids. Warmed fluids may be infused into a dog\u2019s abdomen, stomach, and colon, and they may be given warmed and humidified oxygen to breathe.2 The veterinary team will closely monitor your dog\u2019s body temperature, heart rate and rhythm, oxygenation, blood-glucose levels, and many other parameters so problems can be managed as they arise. Additional treatments directed towards any underlying health problems will be necessary for dogs who develop hypothermia as a result illness or injury. Recovery and Management of Dog Hypothermia Dogs with mild to moderate hypothermia should survive as long as they quickly receive appropriate treatment. Severe hypothermia carries a worse prognosis, but some dogs can be revived even if they are comatose, in part because low temperatures reduce the oxygen and energy needs of cells in the body. There is no way to know how a dog will respond to rewarming without trying, so always get a hypothermic dog to a veterinary hospital as quickly as possible.3"}]
