The nodules are usually the result of an infiltration of inflammatory cells into the skin.\u00a0 This may be a reaction to interal or external stimuli.\u00a0 Symptoms and Types     Nodular dermatofibrosis in German shepherds, 3\u20135 years old    Calcinosis circumscripta in German shepherds, younger than two-years-old    Malignant histiocytosis in Bernese mountain dogs    May affect any age, breed, or gender, although Bernese mountain dogs are at higher risk for malignant histiocytosis and German shepherds are at higher risk for nodular dermatofibrosisCauses     Amyloidosis - a waxy protein deposit, or amyloid, in the body    Reaction to foreign body    Spherulocytosis - disease of red blood cells    Idiopathic sterile granuloma and pyogranuloma    Canine eosinophilic granuloma - eosinophils from blood infiltrates the skin    Calcinosis cutis - skin disease accompanying Cushing\u2019s disease in dogs    Calcinosis circumscripta - skin stones, similar to calcinosis cutis    Malignant histiocytosis - abnormally spreading immune-type cells    Cutaneous histiocytosis - immune-type cells spreading to skin    Sterile panniculitis - inflammation of the skin    Nodular dermatofibrosis - bumps filled with excess elastic skin material which accompanies kidney disease    Cutaneous xanthoma - a benign skin problem, involving immune cell infiltration usually accompanies hyperlipoproteinemia or diabetes mellitusDiagnosis Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, with a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis. You will need to provide a thorough history of your dog&#039;s health leading up to the onset of symptoms. The physical exam should include a dermatologic exam, during which skin biopsies for histopathology can be taken to determine if structural changes have occurred in the tissue.\u00a0 Skin scrapings will also be examined microscopically and cultured for bacteria, mycobacteria and fungi.  Treatment Most of these skin disorders can be treated on an outpatient basis, unless they have reached a severe stage. A few of these disorders, such as malignant histiocytosis, amyloidosis, and nodular dermatofibrosis, are almost always fatal.\u00a0 Dogs with calcinosis cutis may need to be hospitalized for sepsis and intense topical therapy. Some of the other forms of dermatoses with nodules or granulomas are discussed below:     Amyloidosis: no known therapy, unless the lesion is solitary and can be surgically removed    Spherulocytosis: the only effective treatment is surgical removal    Foreign body reactions are best treated by removal of the offending substance if possible    For hair foreign bodies, the dog should be placed on softer bedding and topical therapy with keratolytic agents should be initiated. Many dogs with hair foreign bodies also have secondary deep bacterial infections that need to be treated with both topical and systemic antibiotics    Malignant histiocytosis: no effective therapy. It is rapidly fatal    Calcinosis cutis: underlying disease must be controlled if possible.\u00a0 Most cases require antibiotics to control secondary bacterial infections. Hydrotherapy and frequent bathing in antibacterial shampoos minimize secondary problems. If lesions are extensive, serum calcium levels should be monitored closely    Calcinosis circumscripta: surgical excision is the therapy of choice in most cases\u00a0    Sterile panniculitis: single lesions can be removed surgically    Nodular dermatofibrosis: no therapy for most cases, because the cystadenocarcinomas are usually bilateral    For the rare unilateral case of cystadenocarcinoma or a cystadenoma, removal of the single affected kidney may be helpful    Cutaneous xanthoma: correction of the underlying diabetes mellitus or hyperlipoproteinemia is usually curative\u00a0 Living and Management Your veterinarian will prescribe medication dependent upon your dog&#039;s diagnosis and condition. If your dog is taking long-term glucocorticoids, bloodwork and a urinalysis will need to be performed every six months. If your dog is taking dimethylsulfoxide for calcinosis cutis, bloodwork should be performed every 1-2 weeks to monitor calcium levels until they are regulated."}]
