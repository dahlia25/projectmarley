Nasal adenocarcinoma is the most common type of nasal tumor (cancer) found in dogs. This type of tumor can occur anywhere in a dog\u2019s nasal passage, including the sinus area. Nasal adenocarcinoma is typically aggressive in the nasal area, but it rarely metastasizes (spreads) to other areas of the body. If the cancer does spread, it usually spreads to nearby lymph nodes, lungs, and the brain.\u00a0 Dogs tend to develop these tumors at twice the rate of cats, and studies have shown that these tumors are usually diagnosed around 10 years of age.\u00a0\u00a0 Signs and Symptoms of Nasal Adenocarcinoma in Dogs Most dogs with nasal adenocarcinomas will experience a runny nose prior to a diagnosis. Because this is a common symptom of many conditions, the nasal discharge may improve with treatment, which can delay a proper diagnosis.\u00a0 The discharge may become bloody, clear, or appear like mucus. It often comes out from one side of the nose. As the tumor grows, the discharge may begin to emerge bilaterally, and may be associated with sneezing or snoring sounds.\u00a0 If the tumor grows large enough, it can cause deformities of the face and destroy the surrounding soft and bony tissue. This may cause the eyes to protrude. In rare cases when the tumor spreads to the brain, the pet parent may see changes in behavior as well as sudden blindness or seizures.\u00a0 Common symptoms of nasal adenocarcinoma include:\u00a0 Chronic nasal discharge or bleeding\u00a0 Swelling of the muzzle/face\u00a0 Sneezing\u00a0 Symptoms for nasal adenocarcinoma can sometimes mimic symptoms caused by:\u00a0 Allergies\u00a0 Fungal infections\u00a0 Foreign material lodged in the nasal passages\u00a0 Causes of Nasal Adenocarcinoma in Dogs Although the exact cause for nasal adenocarcinoma is considered idiopathic (unknown), risks appear to increase with exposure to tobacco smoke, kerosene, coal combustion and other airborne pollutants. Due to these types of exposures, dogs in urban environments, especially dogs with longer noses, tend to have higher incidences of this cancer. Flea sprays has also been correlated with the development of nasal tumors in dogs.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Breeds that are predisposed to nasal adenocarcinoma include:\u00a0 Airedale Terriers\u00a0 Poodles\u00a0 Basset Hounds\u00a0 Scottish Terriers\u00a0 Collies\u00a0 Sheepdogs\u00a0 German Shorthair Pointers\u00a0 Labrador and Golden Retrievers\u00a0 How Veterinarians Diagnose Nasal Adenocarcinoma in Dogs When a tumor is suspected, a veterinarian will recommend CT scans and radiographs (x-rays). CT scanning is usually the preferred method to confirm a diagnosis of invasive nasal neoplasia.\u00a0\u00a0 Following the scans, the vet will perform a tissue biopsy (a process called histopathology) to identify the type of cancer. The biopsy is taken from the nasal passage by using surgical equipment to extract the tumor sample.\u00a0\u00a0 Further x-rays may be taken to determine if the tumor has spread (metastasized) to surrounding areas. Other tests may include taking samples from lymph nodes.\u00a0 Treating Nasal Adenocarcinoma in Dogs Unfortunately, nasal adenocarcinoma is usually advanced by the time it\u2019s diagnosed, so surgery to remove the tumors completely, is often not possible. The gold standard for treatment is radiation therapy with adjunctive surgery and chemotherapy.\u00a0 Radiation therapy may require more than 20 treatments to shrink tumors. Therapy may also include radiosurgery, which is when the tumor\u2019s center is attacked with a high dose of radiation to reduce damage to healthy tissue. The treatment may be a single dose or several smaller doses depending on your dog\u2019s specific tumor characteristics.\u00a0 Although side effects are often minimal and temporary, a pet parent may notice a permanent change in their dog\u2019s fur color, as well as skin peeling or ulceration.\u00a0\u00a0 Recovery and Management of Nasal Adenocarcinoma in Dogs Although nasal adenocarcinoma is rarely cured, radiation therapy can push the disease into remission. Dogs can enjoy a good quality of life, with a survival rate of roughly 2 years or more.\u00a0 Some plastic surgery may be necessary after treatment because the therapies used in treatment can destroy facial tissue.\u00a0\u00a0 Dogs that do not undergo a treatment for their nasal adenocarcinoma have a life expectancy of about three to five months after their diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0"}]
