It is often associated with pneumonia, although there are many other possible causes. Normal lungs have fluid that is moved from the lungs into the internal space of the body, an on-going process for normal healthy function. Any added pressure in the dog&#039;s lungs can damage\u00a0 this mechanism, which leads to fluid buildup in the lungs. If this excess fluid is not removed, edema forms. Damage can occur if this condition is left untreated, but when treated appropriately, the outcome is positive. Animals of all ages, genders, and breeds can be diagnosed with pulmonary edema. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library. Symptoms and Types\u00a0 Some of the most common symptoms of pulmonary edema are: Dry coughWheezingCrackling noises during breathing (rales)Difficulty breathing (dyspnea)Abnormally fast breathing (tachypnea)Open-mouth breathingPulmonary edema affects both the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Causes\u00a0 Some of the most common causes for pulmonary edema are:\u00a0 AnemiaPneumoniaCardiomyopathyToo little protein in the blood (hypoproteinemia)Toxins (e.g., smoke and snake venom)An obstruction of the animal&#039;s airwayAlmost drowning (where a high amount of fluid enters the lungs)Diagnosis\u00a0 Upon examination, the following conditions will need to be ruled out for proper treatment: Upper airway obstructionBronchitisPneumoniaHeartworm diseaseHeart diseaseTypically a blood test will be performed to look for abnormalities, as well as an X-ray to view potential signs of pneumonia.  Treatment\u00a0 The type of treatment will be dependent upon the severity of the medical condition. Oxygen may be used to help the animal to breathe, while certain fluids may be administered to aid in the flow of fluids within the dog&#039;s body. Rest is recommended to assist in the dog&#039;s recovery time. Also, diuretics have proven effective at reducing edema, as they work to force excess water and fluids out of the animal&#039;s body. Living and Management\u00a0 This is a condition that has a high recurrence rate, so ongoing management and observation is often recommended and required. Prevention\u00a0 Unfortunately, there are currently no preventive measures for pulmonary edema."}]
