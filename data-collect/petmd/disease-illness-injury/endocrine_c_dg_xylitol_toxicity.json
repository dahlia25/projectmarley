Xylitol is a natural sugar alcohol, which is a type of carbohydrate that does not actually contain alcohol. It has a sweet taste and is often used as a sugar substitute. Xylitol, also known as birch sugar, is found in:\u00a0\u00a0 Sugar-free foods: Baked\u00a0goods/desserts, peanut butter, ice cream, candy, fruit drink, drink powder, jelly/jam, cereal, pudding/Jell-O, ketchup, syrup, chewing gum, and breath mints\u00a0 Medications: Cough\u00a0drop, gummy vitamin, chewable vitamin, and prescription medication\u00a0\u00a0 Dental care products: Toothpaste and mouthwash\u00a0 Beauty products: Shampoo, moisturizer, and deodorant\u00a0 While xylitol may be unharmful to humans, it is toxic and potentially lethal to dogs. The difference is in the way blood sugar is controlled in the body. In both humans and dogs,\u00a0blood\u00a0sugar is regulated by\u00a0the release\u00a0of insulin from the pancreas. In dogs, xylitol triggers a large release of insulin which causes the blood sugar level to drop quickly and dangerously; this is called\u00a0hypoglycemia. In humans, however, xylitol does not affect the pancreas or insulin release,\u00a0so people do not experience any change in blood sugar levels. \u00a0\u00a0 Xylitol can also cause liver damage\u00a0and even liver failure in dogs. It is unknown how this\u00a0happens,\u00a0but it appears to depend on how much xylitol your dog consumes.\u00a0\u00a0 Xylitol\u2019s toxic effects are not yet reported in cats. Scientists, however,\u00a0are not in agreement that cats are completely clear from the effects of xylitol poisoning, so for now it is best to keep xylitol products away from\u00a0all\u00a0your furry pets.\u00a0\u00a0 If your dog ingests xylitol, you should take it immediately to a local veterinary emergency hospital for evaluation and treatment. Symptoms of Xylitol Poisoning in Dogs Symptoms of xylitol poisoning in dogs are typically due to low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and may include:\u00a0\u00a0 Vomiting\u00a0\u00a0 Weakness/Loss of balance\u00a0\u00a0 Stumbling/Lack of coordination\u00a0\u00a0 Lethargy/Depression\u00a0\u00a0 Tremors/Seizures\u00a0\u00a0 Collapse/Coma\u00a0\u00a0 Signs of hypoglycemia may appear as early as 30 minutes after xylitol ingestion but may be delayed up to 12 hours. If you\u00a0notice any of these symptoms, and believe your dog may have ingested xylitol, contact your local veterinary emergency hospital immediately. Causes of Xylitol Poisoning in Dogs Xylitol poisoning in dogs is usually caused by accidental ingestion of a product containing xylitol which is included in\u00a0many\u00a0foods and household products. Therefore, xylitol poisoning relatively common in dogs. \u00a0 Xylitol\u00a0is not always clearly labeled as such, so look for words such as \u201cbirch sugar\u201d or \u201cartificial sweetener\u201d in a product\u2019s ingredients list. If in doubt, call the Pet Poison Helpline or ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center for more information on a specific product, and if your pet needs treatment. \u00a0\u00a0 One of the most common causes of xylitol poisoning in dogs is ingesting sugar-free chewing gum, which dogs may find rummaging through a bag or purse. Be sure to keep all gum securely away from your pets. \u00a0\u00a0 A dog only needs to eat as little as 0.045 grams/pound.\u00a0(0.1gram/kilogram) to experience hypoglycemia from xylitol ingestion. Liver damage occurs at a much higher dose of 0.11 to 0.22 gram/pound\u00a0(0.25 to 0.5gram/kilogram). Most chewing gums contain 0.2 to 1.0 grams of xylitol per piece, which means only one piece of gum can cause low blood sugar in a 20-pound\u00a0dog, and as few as 2 to 4 pieces of gum can cause liver damage and failure. \u00a0\u00a0 How Veterinarians Diagnose Xylitol Poisoning in Dogs If you see your dog eat a product containing xylitol or suspect it may have\u00a0eaten it, take your pet to a local veterinary emergency hospital immediately. The vet will ask for a thorough history of the incident, so it is very helpful to bring the packaging (or what is left of it) from the product your dog ingested.\u00a0To diagnose xylitol poisoning, a vet will perform a physical exam to assess your dog\u2019s mental and neurological status. A complete blood count, serum blood chemistry, and urinalysis are likely recommended for a baseline evaluation.\u00a0This includes checking your dog\u2019s blood sugar and baseline liver values, which will need to be monitored for the next 72 hours to ensure there is no liver damage. \u00a0\u00a0 Treatment of Xylitol Poisoning in Dogs Dogs should be treated as soon as possible for xylitol poisoning. If your dog is not showing symptoms of poisoning, and the ingestion occurred fewer than six hours prior, your vet will likely induce vomiting. \u00a0\u00a0 Next, the vet will try to maintain your dog\u2019s normal blood sugar levels, which may include IV fluids with dextrose supplementation. Your dog will likely be hospitalized overnight for observation and serial blood sugar will be monitored. It may also be given a liver protectant medication. Recovery and Management of Xylitol Poisoning in Dogs Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are crucial in treating xylitol poisoning in dogs. Hypoglycemia may lead to seizures and coma, and severe liver damage may lead to liver failure. Overall, the prognosis is very good for dogs with only hypoglycemia, and who are treated promptly upon ingesting xylitol. Most dogs are\u00a0hospitalized\u00a0for observation for 12 to 24 hours. The pet\u2019s bloodwork is rechecked to monitor Its liver values for 72 hours after ingesting xylitol. If the liver values are normal at that time, then there should be no long-term damage. \u00a0\u00a0 Prevention of Xylitol Poisoning in Dogs\u00a0\u00a0 Reading product labels is one important way to prevent xylitol poisoning in dogs. Look for xylitol as an ingredient, also for products labeled as \u201csugar-free,\u201d \u201cno sugar added,\u201d \u201cdiabetic friendly,\u201d \u201creduced sugar,\u201d or \u201cbirch sugar.\u201d\u00a0 If you are unsure about a product\u2019s safety, don\u2019t feed it to your pet. Peanut butter is often used as a treat or to\u00a0administer\u00a0medication to dogs, so be sure to select the kind that is safe for your dog. \u00a0\u00a0 Keep all xylitol-containing foods and household products away from your dog and in a secure place. Dogs are very clever and will find ways to get to these dangerous items. \u00a0\u00a0"}]
