Hives usually develop quickly after exposure to the substance and can appear anywhere on a dog's body. Hives are caused when a dog comes in contact with or inhales and allergen. Some common causes include insect bites or stings.\n\nPlants such as poison ivy or poison oak insecticides food allergies or any other substance that may cause hypersensitivity in your pet hives may also develop as a reaction to vaccinations. Different dogs will have different allergic reactions, even if exposed to the same allergen. So some cases of hives will be more severe than others. Generally hives manifest as medium to large areas of redness on a dog's body or redness and swelling around a dog's face and muzzle.\n\nUsually these areas are raised and circular in shape because hives are extremely itchy. You may notice your dog scratching excessively, which could lead to more in irritation and discomfort. It is not uncommon for hives to clear up on their own after the allergen is removed from a dog's body. But if your dog is suffering from hives for the first time.\n\nIt's a good idea to see a veterinarian who can prevent the reaction from becoming more severe or spreading to areas such as the throat that could swell and become dangerous. Your veterinarian may provide topical or oral in his means to help control the itching and swelling associated with hives and using a cold towel or ice to soothe your dog's skin. They also prevent excessive scratching.", "potentialAction": {"@type": "SeekToAction", "target": "https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/skin/hives-dogs-causes-symptoms-and-treatment-options?wtime={seek_to_second_number}", "startOffset-input": "required name=seek_to_second_number"}}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "BreadcrumbList", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 0, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.petmd.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Diseases A-Z", "item": "https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "FAQPage", "mainEntity": [{"@type": "Question", "name": "Are dog hives an emergency?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes.

Hives (also referred to as urticaria) are areas of the skin that appear reddened and raised. Just as with humans, hives can be very itchy for your dog. They\u2019re a sign that an allergy is causing the immune system to overreact. Hives can appear very quickly\u2014and disappear just as quickly. The raised red area of the skin is referred to as a \u201cwheal,\u201d and it can appear anywhere from a few minutes to hours after exposure to an allergen. Wheals can appear anywhere on your dog\u2019s body, but they\u2019re usually found on the head, neck, back, stomach, and legs. In mild cases, the hives will generally disappear within 12-48 hours after contact with the allergen. However, because of the risk that the reaction can worsen to dangerous swelling of your dog\u2019s airways or a serious allergic reaction called anaphylaxis, you should seek out treatment any time you see hives on your dog. This is especially true for hives that occur on the face or around the throat, which can lead to dangerous swelling and possible blockage of the airways. Symptoms of Dog Hives Red raised areas of skin called wheals, which can occur anywhere (including mucous membranes) but are most commonly seen on the head, neck, back, abdomen, and legs Intense itching Excessive drooling if the mouth is swollen Swelling (angioedema), which is particularly concerning when it involves the face and respiratory system and can have severe and life-threatening consequences Causes of Dog Hives The allergen that causes the hives may be environmental, chemical, or dietary. Any allergen your dog is sensitive can also lead to hives. Common causes include: Insect stings/bites (often involving the head and neck of your pup) Shampoos or topical agents Medications Vaccinations Toxic plants Food allergens Insects bites, chemical contact, and medications are the most common. How Vets Diagnose Hives Your vet will closely examine your dog to locate the distinctive wheals associated with hives. Wheals typically have hair on them, and may appear in clusters. Beyond the physical examination, other parts of the diagnosis include: Any history you are able to provide; be as thorough as you can in describing allergens your dog might have come into contact with and when and where you first saw the hives Your dog\u2019s response to treatment Treatment for Dog Hives Dogs with hives usually respond quickly to treatment, which may include: Antihistamine (oral or injectable) and a steroid Injectable medications and intravenous fluids (in very serious cases) At-home treatments may include: Cold compresses over the hives or swollen areas to give relief from itching Antihistamines, but only under the supervision of your vet Management of Dog Hives Work with your vet to determine the cause of the hives, using both your dog\u2019s health history and history of exposure to allergens. Depending on the cause and the frequency, your vet may recommend: Allergy testing to confirm environmental allergens Immunotherapy treatment to desensitize your dog to specific allergens A food trial to find ingredients that cause a reaction and develop specific dietary recommendations"}]
