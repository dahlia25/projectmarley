A rash can occur on any part of your dog\u2019s body, but it pops up most often on the belly. A rash by itself is usually minor and often goes away on its own, but it can be a sign of a more serious situation. The cause of rashes on a dog can range from parasites to diabetes. Here\u2019s what you should know about rashes on dogs, from what to look for to possible causes and their treatments. What to Check For if Your Dog Has a Rash If your dog\u2019s rash gets worse or does not go away after a week, take your dog to the vet to be examined.

The location of the rash can provide some clues as to what health issue may have caused it: Belly rash or underarm rash: A belly rash on a dog is one of the more common reasons pet parents take their dogs to the vet. Rashes also often appear in a dog\u2019s \u201cunderarms,\u201d more accurately, the point where a dog\u2019s front and hind legs meet the chest or abdomen.

To diagnose a rash, your veterinarian will perform a number of tests, depending on the suspected cause, including: Allergy tests if an allergen is suspected. This may include a food elimination diet or intradermal allergy testing. Skin scraping to look for mites, bacteria, fungus, or other potential causes. Skin biopsy, where a piece of skin is examined at a pathology laboratory (done in cases of recurring infection or rash). Blood profile to check for diseases such as thyroid issues (hypothyroidism) or Cushing\u2019s disease Treatment for Rashes on Dogs To eliminate the rash and make sure it doesn\u2019t come back, your vet will need to find and treat any underlying medical condition that\u2019s causing it. They may also recommend several treatments for the rash and related symptoms. These may include: Grooming (such as brushing or cutting away hair) Oatmeal baths Medicated dog shampoo (containing antifungal or antibacterial ingredients) Anti-itch and anti-inflammatory medications Elizabethan collar or e-collar to prevent a dog from irritating hot spots by licking or biting Epsom salt foot soaks if your dog\u2019s paws are inflamed.
