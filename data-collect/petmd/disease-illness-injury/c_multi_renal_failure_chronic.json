Chronic renal failure (CRF), renal insufficiency, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are all medical terms used to describe the same condition. It occurs when the kidneys are unable to perform their required tasks at the same level of efficiency as before.\u00a0\u00a0 Dogs have two kidneys located on either side of their abdomen, that play a vital role in filtering waste from the body. Additionally, the kidneys serve to regulate fluid, mineral, and electrolyte balance; conserve water and protein; and play an important role in maintaining blood pressure and red blood cell production by making a hormone called erythropoietin.\u00a0\u00a0 Dogs cannot survive without their kidneys, and unfortunately, kidney transplants are yet to be a viable solution. Dialysis (a treatment for failing kidneys including the removal of waste) is often expensive and is extremely rare in dogs. However, early diagnosis and intervention is key to help maintain your dog\u2019s quality of life.\u00a0 Once diagnosed, CRF is then classified into four different stages based on severity of clinical signs and laboratory values:\u00a0 Stage I: Clinical signs usually not apparent\u00a0\u00a0 Stage II: Some clinical signs noted\u00a0\u00a0 Stage III: Many clinical signs noted, and pets often feel \u201csick\u201d\u00a0 Stage IV: Majority of clinical signs noted, pets often present as a crisis\u00a0 Causes of Chronic Renal Failure in Dogs The term \u201cchronic\u201d in chronic renal failure means that the process has been ongoing, is progressive, and unfortunately, cannot be reversed. For some dogs, the disease could have occurred after a serious kidney injury such as from a severe infection (i.e., leptospirosis, pyelonephritis) or ingestion of a toxic substance such as anti-freeze, grapes, or raisins, and certain antibiotics.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For others, it could be inherited, such as with glomerular disease (a specific type of renal kidney disease) and amyloidosis (a rare organ disease) as seen in breeds like the Bernese Mountain Dog and Shar-pei.\u00a0\u00a0 For others, it could be attributed to underlying immune-mediated diseases, stroke-like events, or even from clotting disorders. In cases for newly diagnosed dogs the underlying cause will likely remain unknown.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Symptoms of Chronic Renal Failure in Dogs Clinical signs are often related to the severity of the CRF stage, meaning there are additional and more severe signs noted with stages III and IV than there are with stages I and II. Dogs often exhibit symptoms including:\u00a0\u00a0 Increased thirst and urination\u00a0 Intermittent vomiting\u00a0 Dehydration\u00a0\u00a0 Oral ulcerations (sores in the mouth)\u00a0 Foul breath\u00a0 Weight loss\u00a0 Decreased appetite\u00a0\u00a0 Some dogs may show muscle wasting and signs attributed to high blood pressure, such as vision loss and weakness.\u00a0\u00a0 How Veterinarians Diagnose Chronic Renal Failure in Dogs CRF is often diagnosed based on routine blood work and a urinalysis looking specifically at kidney markers such as:\u00a0 Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): A by-product of protein metabolism, higher values can often indicate kidney failure\u00a0 Creatinine (CREA): Measures how well kidneys are filtering waste from blood\u00a0 Phosphorous: Elevated phosphorus levels typically indicate kidney damage\u00a0 Electrolytes (Sodium, potassium, chloride)\u00a0 Calcium\u00a0 Red blood cell count: A low red blood cell count may indicate kidney failure\u00a0 Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA): An additional test to help determine if kidney disease is present; it can be used for early detection of kidney disease\u00a0 Urine specific gravity: A marker of how diluted or concentrated the urine is. Usually the higher the number, the more concentrated the urine is and the greater ability of the kidney to conserve water.\u00a0\u00a0 Your veterinarian will most likely recommend additional diagnostic testing, including:\u00a0 A urine protein to creatinine (UPC) ratio to quantify how much protein is being lost in the urine\u00a0 A urine culture, as dogs in CKD are more likely to acquire urinary tract infections\u00a0 A blood pressure evaluation\u00a0 Radiographs or abdominal ultrasound to screen for kidney stones or infarcts (areas of dead tissue)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Treatment of Chronic Renal Failure in Dogs Dogs with CRF are generally older and have other ongoing issues, such as arthritis or liver disease, and so the management of CRF can be challenging. However, CRF can be managed, mostly with the aid of medications, diet, and hydration.\u00a0\u00a0 Specific management is geared toward each stage of the disease, with each progressive stage recommendations built upon the previous stage recommendations. Any dog in any stage with an increase in either UPC (urine protein to creatinine ratio) or high blood pressure will most likely be treated with medication.\u00a0\u00a0 Throughout your dog\u2019s life, any disease process or illness that could affect his hydration should be treated promptly with IV fluids. Other drugs will be prescribed based on the dog\u2019s diagnosis since renal metabolism will be affected and can lead to overdosages and/or worsening of the kidney disease.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Additionally, for all stages, fresh water should always be available, drinking should be encouraged, and adequate nutrition should be given daily. Dogs diagnosed with CRF are most likely prescribed a kidney friendly diet, which may include feeding your dog a canned diet of wet food that contains additional water.\u00a0 Recovery and Prevention of Chronic Renal Failure in Dogs As chronic renal failure is not curable and often progressive (although the timeline is variable) in nature, dogs diagnosed early on will benefit from nutritional management and consistent veterinary attention, which may include more frequent check-ups and blood work.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dogs in stages I and II may often be monitored for further progression of signs, and some may be given a prescription diet specifically geared to help the kidney, by limiting the amount of work they must do.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Many dogs can go on to have a decent quality of life for many months to years. Dogs in stages III and IV often require more medical and dietary assistance. If secondary anemia is present, erythropoietin injections can be given at the direction of your veterinarian.\u00a0\u00a0 Dietary supplements, and phosphorus binders (to treat high phosphorus levels) may also be given for low potassium. Anti-nausea and anti-emetic (anti-vomiting) medications can also be prescribed for dogs with a poor appetite, vomiting, or nausea. Fluids given either intravenously or underneath the skin can help dehydration. Because of the severity of signs often seen in dogs with stage III and IV, and the amount of care and effort required to support these dogs, some may be humanely euthanized.\u00a0\u00a0"}]
