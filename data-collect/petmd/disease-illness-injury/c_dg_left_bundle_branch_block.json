LBBB may be complete or partial in nature. Symptoms and Types Often, no specific symptoms are seen that can be attributed to LBBB, only those that are related to the underlying disease causing the defect. Causes     Cardiomyopathy    Cancerous tumors    Direct or indirect cardiac trauma (e.g., hit by car and cardiac needle puncture)    Narrowing just below the aortic valve, which supplies the body with oxygenated blood (subvalvular aortic stenosis)    Replacement of heart muscle with scar tissue (fibrosis)    Ischemic cardiomyopathy (i.e., hardening or thickening of the coronary arteries, death of heart muscle due to lack of oxygen)Diagnosis You will need to give a thorough history of your dog\u2019s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which are typically non-specific. Left bundle branch block is often only found accidentally, perhaps while performing an echocardiogram. In the case of this defect, he or she may identify structural defects in the heart without left-side side enlargement. Thoracic and abdominal radiography may also show masses and other abnormalities, while Holter monitoring may reveal intermittent LBBB.  Treatment Treatment is directed towards treating underlying cause. Living and Management This condition itself is not life-threatening and treating the underlying cause results in complete resolution of problem. However, if left untreated, LBBB can lead to more severe heart rhythm changes or even complete heart block. You may be required to take your pet for regular follow-ups exams to evaluate the status of disease and the dog&#039;s response to treatment. No diet modifications are necessary, unless required to manage underlying condition."}]
