It is thought to be caused by an abnormal immune response to environmental stimuli due to loss of normal immune regulation, in which bacteria in the intestine may be a trigger. Continued antigen exposure, along with unregulated inflammation, results in disease, although the exact mechanisms and underlying factors remain unknown. Lymphocyic-plasmacytic gastroenteritis is the most common form of IBD affecting dogs (and cats). Basenjis, Lundenhunds, and Soft-coated Wheaton Terriers have particular familial forms of IBD. \u00a0 Symptoms and Types Signs vary dramatically from patient to patient depending on disease severity and the organ affected. Symptoms to look for include: Intermittent, chronic vomitingChronic, small bowel diarrheaLoss of appetite (anorexia)Long-term weight loss (cachexia)Black stollBlood in the stool (red)Coughing up/vomiting up bloodCauses Genetic predispositionBacterial and parasites infectionsOvergrowth of normal bacteria found in the intestines and stomach is suspectedPossibly altered intestinal bacterial populations and immune alterationsMay be related to meat proteins, food additives, artificial coloring, preservatives, milk proteins and gluten (wheat)Diagnosis Your veterinarian will do a complete physical exam and take a thorough history from you. A chemical blood profile, urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel will be ordered. Depending on their results, he or she may run intestinal tests or take blood to check the function of your dog\u2019s thyroid and pancreas. An endoscopy may be performed, which is very useful for the veterinarian to get a clearer look at the condition of the stomach and intestines, and to take samples for testing. In addition, a fecal sample will be taken for microscopic analysis to check for parasites.  Treatment Your veterinarian will keep your dog in the hospital if it is severely dehydrated due to chronic vomiting and diarrhea. There, your pet will be given fluids intravenously. (It should not be fed by mouth while it is still vomiting.) If your pet is severely underweight, your veterinarian may insert a stomach tube to feed your pet. Depending on the underlying cause, he or she will change your pet\u2019s diet, which is called elimination diets. Medication is also available depending on the underlying cause of the disease. Living and Management You will be advised to bring the dog back for a follow-up appointment. If the animal is still very ill or on strong medication, less time will pass between check-ups. As your pet stabilizes, your veterinarian will want to examine your pet less often. You will also work with the veterinarian to formulate a new diet and assess the results on a continual basis until there are no more signs of illness."}]
