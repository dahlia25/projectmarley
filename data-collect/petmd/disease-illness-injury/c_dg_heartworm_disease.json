Dirofilaria immitis is the organism that causes heartworm disease not only in dogs, but also in cats, ferrets, and other mammals. It is a large worm, reaching up to a foot or more in length, and as it completes its life cycle, which takes about six to seven months, it ends up in the heart and pulmonary vessels, where it can live for several more years. As the heart becomes clogged with worms, there is less blood it can push out to the rest of the body, and heart failure can result. Symptoms of Heartworm Disease in Dogs The severity of the infection will be related to the symptoms present, and symptoms of heartworm disease are related to the organs affected: the heart and lungs. Symptoms often include:\u00a0\u00a0 Cough\u00a0\u00a0 Lethargy\u00a0\u00a0 Exercise intolerance\u00a0\u00a0 Collapse\u00a0\u00a0 Sudden death\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some dogs may show weight loss, difficulty breathing, and even excessive panting. Left untreated, dogs may go on to experience right-sided heart failure and ascites (buildup of fluid in the abdomen). Causes of Heartworm Disease in Dogs  Mosquitoes serve as the primary vector (carrier) for transmission of heartworm disease; transmission cannot occur from one dog to another. As mosquitoes bite and take a blood meal from an infected host, they ingest circulating microfilariae, or young immature heartworms. Inside the mosquito, the microfilariae undergo three stages of larval development (called L1, L2, and L3).\u00a0\u00a0 When the same mosquito bites a dog, the L3 is deposited onto the dog\u2019s skin, and it then migrates into the dog\u2019s body and develops into L4. Then as an L5, it migrates throughout the tissues and bloodstream, winding up in the heart, where it takes up residence as an adult. This entire process usually takes about four months to complete.\u00a0 A few months later, around 7 months of age, the adult females become sexually mature, mate, and produce microfilariae. The commercially prepared tests to diagnose heartworm disease in the veterinary hospital detect antigens (proteins uniquely found on the surface of an organism that are used to detect the presence of that organism in the sample) produced by the female adult heartworm; that\u2019s why testing usually starts around 7 months of age. How Veterinarians Diagnose Heartworm Disease in Dogs Dogs 7 months and older should be tested for heartworm disease at least annually. If the dog misses a dose of prevention, then she should be tested more frequently. Testing is often done in the hospital at the bedside and requires a small amount of blood.\u00a0\u00a0 The most widely used method for diagnosing heartworm disease is antigen-based testing. Antigens are proteins uniquely found on the surface of an organism that are used to detect the presence of that organism in the sample. In this case, the antigens being tested for are produced by the female adult heartworm, and if the test shows positive, then the dog is infected.\u00a0\u00a0 Other tests that can be performed include a blood smear or a modified Knott\u2019s test (often a test that is sent out for diagnosis), which are done to check for the presence of circulating microfilariae.\u00a0\u00a0 Once diagnosis has been obtained, your veterinarian may recommend more testing, which is used to find out the severity of the infection as well as the amount of risk involved for treatment. Other testing often includes chest radiographs, EKG, blood pressure, cardiac enzyme evaluation (NT-proBNP), echocardiogram, blood work, and urine testing.\u00a0\u00a0 Class I dogs are those with the lowest amount of risk for treatment, and Class IV dogs are those often diagnosed with caval syndrome and are at highest risk. This means the worm burden is so great that the worms are blocking blood from exiting the heart. These dogs are dying and require surgical removal of the worms (often done by a specialist) to survive. Treatment of Heartworm Disease in Dogs Once your dog is diagnosed, your veterinarian will most likely explain to you next steps including treatment options, more diagnostics, and time frame for follow-up visits.\u00a0\u00a0 First, your dog should have his activities restricted as exercise can increase the potential for the heartworms to dislodge and cause clots elsewhere in the body. Additionally, if your dog has circulating microfilariae in his bloodstream, mosquitoes, after ingesting a blood meal from your dog, can then transmit the parasite to others, so limited exposure to the outside is recommended.\u00a0\u00a0 Certain medications may be prescribed, such as:\u00a0 Steroids: to decrease inflammation created by the worm itself\u00a0 Antibiotics: doxycycline is used to kill Wolbachia, a symbiote organism that lives within the heartworm. Without the symbiote, the host heartworm becomes easier to kill and secondary inflammation is minimized.\u00a0 Specific kind of heartworm preventive: to prevent younger worms from developing into adults and to rid the bloodstream of any circulating microfilariae\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An injection containing the arsenic-based compound melarsomine will be given to your dog 60 days, 90 days, and 91 days after diagnosis by the veterinarian. This is a medication designed to kill the adult heartworms and is usually administered in the lower back deep into the muscle. As it is painful, pain medications will most likely be sent home at those visits as well.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prevention of Heartworm Disease in Dogs The best way to treat your dog is to do your best to prevent the disease in the first place with year-round heartworm prevention. The good news is that there are multiple types and forms of heartworm prevention on the market, and they are all affordable.\u00a0\u00a0 There are tablets, topicals, and even injectable versions that can provide anywhere from 1 month to 12 months of protection. There are even products that are combined with flea and tick control to give your dog a more comprehensive preventive profile.\u00a0\u00a0 All products are designed to kill the L3 and/or L4 heartworm larvae, and some will clear the blood system from circulating microfilariae.\u00a0\u00a0 If your dog tests positive for heartworm disease, it is important to discuss the specific type of preventative needed while treating it, as there are only a few that should be given to minimize secondary complications.\u00a0\u00a0 You should speak with your veterinarian to decide the best type of prevention for your dog\u2019s lifestyle and your budget. Limiting your dog\u2019s exposure to mosquitoes will also help, but in some places, limiting exposure is nearly impossible. It only takes one infected mosquito to cause heartworm disease.\u00a0\u00a0 Recovery and Management of Heartworm Disease in Dogs Treatment for heartworm disease is not risk free. Dogs that undergo heartworm treatment as discussed above can suffer from anaphylaxis (shock), emboli (clots), and sudden death, not to mention the possibility of abscess (pocket of pus) formation at the site of melarsomine injection and the emotional distress from months of exercise restriction.\u00a0\u00a0 Dogs can also suffer from long-term health risks from the damage caused by the worms to their heart and lungs. Scarring and inflammation (swelling) generated by the worms makes it difficult for blood to be pumped through the heart and lungs, and right-sided heart failure can develop, even with successful treatment.\u00a0 The degree of severity will affect the prognosis, and the sooner the disease is caught and treated, the greater likelihood there is for a good outcome. Unfortunately, dogs that suffer from heartworm disease do not get immunity and are at risk for becoming infected again in the future. That is why year-round prevention is critical for your dog\u2019s health."}]
