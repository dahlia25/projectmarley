Iris bombe occurs when there is a complete adhesion between the iris and the capsule of the lens of the eye creating a 360 degree area of adhesion. This results in a billowing of the iris forward into the eye. Iris bombe can occur in both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn how this type of eye problem affects cats, please visit this page in the petMD health library. Symptoms and Types Symptoms seen with iris bombe include:     Squinting    Corneal lesions, such      as ulcers    Excessive tearing    Glaucoma    Variation in the color      of the iris    Opacity of the lens    Uveitis    Decreased papillary      reaction to lightCauses     Chronic infection    Corneal ulcer    Foreign body injury to      the eye    Hyphema (bleeding in      the front part of the eye)    Penetrating wounds to      the eye    SurgeryDiagnosis Diagnosis is based on an ophthalmic examination, which involves examining the structures of the eye. Tonometry may be performed to measure the intraocular pressure (the pressure within the eyeball.)  Treatment In some cases, treatment may not be necessary. However, when glaucoma occurs, it must be treated. In cases like this, laser surgery may be necessary to release the adhesions."}]
