Peritonitis is a condition in which the membrane that lines abdominal cavity (called the peritoneum) becomes inflamed, often due to injury or infection. The peritoneum is a thin, watery lining that lubricates the abdominal organs (such as the stomach).\u00a0\u00a0 This can cause fluid to build up in the abdomen.\u202fPeritonitis\u202fcan be a very serious\u202fand life-threatening condition\u202fin dogs\u202fand requires immediate treatment.\u00a0\u00a0 Symptoms of \u202fDog Peritonitis\u202f Symptoms of\u202fperitonitis vary widely and can be confused with symptoms caused by many other conditions.\u202fIf your dog shows any of the following signs, bring them to your veterinarian immediately (especially if your dog exhibits two or more symptoms).\u00a0 Abdominal pain is a very common symptom of peritonitis. Dogs may show abdominal pain by appearing in a \u201cprayer\u201d position (rear end up in the air while their front legs and head are lowered onto the floor).\u202f Abdominal distension or bloating may also occur.\u00a0\u00a0 Other signs of illness include:\u00a0 Vomiting, nausea, or refusing to eat\u00a0 Diarrhea\u00a0\u00a0 Fever\u202f\u00a0 Weakness and lack of energy\u00a0 Dehydration\u202f\u00a0 Pale gums\u00a0 Causes of\u202f Peritonitis in Dogs Peritonitis occurs when the abdominal cavity becomes injured and inflamed, so the condition has many possible causes. For example, peritonitis can occur when a dog suffers a penetrating injury or blunt trauma to the abdomen (such as wounds sustained from stabbing or kicking).\u00a0\u00a0 Intestinal blockages caused by swallowing foreign objects can also lead to peritonitis.\u00a0 Other possible causes include:\u00a0 Ruptured bladder, uterus, or gall bladder\u00a0 Tears in surgical sites\u00a0 Ulcers (ulcer-related holes in the stomach lining can be caused by medication like non-steroidal anti-inflammatories or NSAIDs)\u00a0 Abdominal tumors\u00a0 Disorders of other internal organs (e.g., heart, kidneys, liver, spleen, or pancreas)\u00a0 Twisted stomach or bloat\u00a0 Liver inflammation (hepatitis)\u00a0 Less frequently,\u202fperitonitis can be caused by blood-borne infection (e.g., bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic). Rarely, the cause of the peritonitis is unknown or cannot be determined. \u202f\u00a0 Although not inherited, some breeds have a higher likelihood of developing conditions that lead to peritonitis. For example, young large-breed dogs such as Labrador\u202fRetrievers may be more likely to swallow a foreign object (such as a sock or underwear), causing an intestinal blockage and rupture that results in peritonitis.\u00a0\u00a0 On the other hand, breeds like miniature\u202fSchnauzers are more prone to pancreatitis, which also can lead to peritonitis. Finally, giant breed dogs such as Great Danes will be more likely to develop \u201ctwisted\u201d stomach\u201d (gastric\u202fdilatation\u202fand volvulus). \u202f\u00a0 How Veterinarians Diagnose Dog Peritonitis\u202f Diagnosing peritonitis begins with a physical examination to check for abdominal pain and fever. Your veterinarian will ask about your dog\u2019s medical history, including recent surgical procedures and current medications (particularly NSAIDs).\u00a0 You will also be asked about potential trauma and anything your dog might have swallowed. Other tests commonly used to investigate peritonitis include:\u00a0 A blood test to assess overall organ function, white blood cell count and dehydration\u00a0 Abdominal x-rays to look for fluid within the abdomen as well as intestinal blockage or masses\u00a0 Abdominal ultrasound to confirm the presence of fluid in the abdomen\u00a0 A fluid sample drawn from a needle (abdominocentesis) to check for inflammatory cells and bacteria\u00a0 Treatment for\u202f Dog Peritonitis If the test results indicate peritonitis, your dog will need to be hospitalized and be put on IV fluids. Medication will be given to treat symptoms of nausea, pain, and diarrhea. Antibiotics will also likely be an important part of your pet\u2019s care. \u202f\u00a0 Emergency surgery is usually required to repair the underlying cause of the inflammation, such as a rupture, wound, or abscess. In rare cases where the\u202fspecific cause of the peritonitis cannot\u202fbe identified, the surgeon will rinse the abdomen with sterile saline. Recovery and Management of\u202f Peritonitis in Dogs Diagnosing and treating peritonitis as soon as possible is key to achieving the best outcome and minimizing complications. Recovering from this serious condition often requires 3 to 5 days (and sometimes more) following surgery.\u00a0\u00a0 During this time, IV fluids, antibiotics, and nutritional support are required. Unfortunately, even with intensive support the survival rate is about 50%. If sepsis has set in, the survival rate is lower.\u00a0 Your veterinarian will discharge your dog when she is fever-free and can eat without throwing up. Expect a full recovery to take 10-14 days of rest with minimal activity.\u00a0\u00a0 Depending on what caused the peritonitis in the first place, your dog can make a complete recovery and resume normal activity. For example, if peritonitis was caused by swallowing a foreign object, then it will be important to prevent a future occurrence.\u00a0\u00a0 If the peritonitis was the result of an underlying issue, such as a bowel rupture caused by a tumor, then more extensive tests are required to diagnose and treat the cause.\u00a0"}]
