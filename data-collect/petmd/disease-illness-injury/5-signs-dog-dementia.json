Here are seven signs to look out for that could mean your dog has canine dementia.", "articleBody": "While your beloved senior dog can\u2019t really forget where he put his car keys, he is capable of experiencing \u201csenior moments.\u201d If your dog forgets the route on your daily walk or if he\u2019s not enjoying the things he once did, like chasing after his favorite toy or greeting you at the door, he could be suffering from canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD), or the doggy version of Alzheimer\u2019s. To help detect the onset of cognitive decline earlier, it\u2019s important to know what signs you should be looking for in your dog. 7 Signs of Dementia in Dogs Dr. Denise Petryk, DVM, says the widely accepted DISHA acronym can help dog owners characterize the most distinct signs and changes associated with CCD. DISHA refers to these symptoms: Disorientation [altered] Interactions with family members or other pets Sleep-wake cycle changes House soiling Activity level changes\u00a0 \u201cIt gives us the ability to check against a list of things to show that something else isn\u2019t going on. If your dog has one of the symptoms or some combination, then we\u2019re more likely to call it cognitive dysfunction,\u201d explains Dr. Petryk. In addition to DISHA symptoms, you may notice these signs of dog dementia: Having trouble eating or finding food or water dish Repetitive or restless movements Dr. Bonnie Beaver, a board-certified veterinary behaviorist, says to keep in mind that there isn\u2019t necessarily a progression to the symptoms your dog may be experiencing. \u201cThe more signs and frequency we see, the greater significance of the problem. Each sign or symptom doesn\u2019t really signify a particular phase,\u201d she says. Here\u2019s what you need to know about each of the symptoms for cognitive dysfunction in dogs: Disorientation One of the most common things you may notice is that your senior dog gets disoriented even when he\u2019s in his normal or familiar environment. \u201cThis often happens when the dog is out in the backyard and he goes to the wrong door or the wrong side of the door to get back in. The part of the brain that is involved with orientation has been affected.\u201d Dr. Beaver says. Your dog may also experience difficulty with spatial awareness. He may wander behind the couch and then realize he doesn\u2019t know where he is or how to get out. At bedtime, you may find your dog in a different part of the house, staring at the wall instead of curled up in his dog bed. According to Dr. Petryk, dogs have a good sense of timing, so this is a sign that something is wrong. \u201cThe first thing you should do is to take your dog in for a checkup. It might not be a cognitive issue, so your vet may want to rule out some other possible medical causes, which could involve a brain tumor or diabetes.\u201d Changes in Interactions With Family, Other Pets or Guests Canine cognitive dysfunction can affect your dog\u2019s interactions with people and other animals. Your once sociable dog, who used to be the most popular pup on the block, now acts cranky and irritable, or even growls at other animals or children. He may lash out and bite his once favorite playmates. Dr. Petryk cautions that this behavior could be the result of something serious. \u201cHe may be acting this way because he\u2019s in pain. He could have arthritis or some other ailment that hurts when he moves or is touched. Your vet may want to do X-rays to rule out a painful condition,\u201d explains Dr. Petryk. Some dogs with CCD withdraw from their family and their favorite activities. They may fail to notice when the doorbell rings and seem disinterested in greeting visitors, or they may stop barking at the mail carrier. Your dog may not even respond when you get his leash out to go for a walk.\u00a0 Talk with your veterinarian if you notice changes in the way your dog interacts with those around him. They can help rule out potential health issues and help you learn how to support your dog\u2019s evolving needs. Sleep-Wake Cycle Changes A change in sleep patterns or a disruption in circadian rhythms is one of the more specific symptoms related to cognitive dysfunction. Dogs that used to sleep soundly may now pace all night. Many dogs reverse their normal schedules, so their daytime activities become their nighttime activities. This \u201cup all night\u201d routine can be frustrating and tiring to pet owners. \u201cIf your dog is active at night and you want to get him to sleep, a nightlight or white noise may help him,\u201d Dr. Beaver says. If this doesn\u2019t provide relief, consult your veterinarian for medications that may ease your dog\u2019s anxiety and reestablish normal sleep cycles. House Soiling Urinating or defecating in the house is one of the most common ways cognitive dysfunction is detected in dogs, especially if the dog was previously house-trained. Dr. Petryk says that when this happens, it\u2019s important to consider that your dog may have lost his ability to voluntarily control elimination or even to let you know that he needs to go outside. \u201cAfter we run tests and rule out a bladder infection, kidney problems or diabetes, then there\u2019s usually been a cognitive change. If your dog is staring out at the sliding glass door and then poops in the house anyway, and it\u2019s not because of bowel trouble; he\u2019s lost the understanding that he should poop outside,\u201d Dr. Petryk explains. Decreased Activity Levels Dogs with cognitive dysfunction may show a decreased desire to explore and a decreased response to things, people and sounds in their environments. They may not greet you or they may no longer respond on cue to fetch their favorite toy. They may also be less focused and show an altered response to stimuli. Having Trouble Eating and Drinking Some dogs have trouble eating or drinking or even finding their food bowls. &quot;They may drop something when they\u2019re eating and they can\u2019t find it,\u201d says Dr. Petryk. \u201cIf they don\u2019t have sight or hearing issues, this can be a true indication that they are experiencing cognitive dysfunction.\u201d &quot;I&#039;ve had patients whose dogs don&#039;t recognize that their favorite cookies are treats for them,\u201d says Dr. Petryk. \u201cThe owner&#039;s first instinct is to buy other cookies. They don&#039;t realize that something else could be going on.\u201d Repetitive or Restless Movements \u00a0 Although older dogs experience a normal decline in activity levels, they may also experience symptoms that seem like restlessness. &quot;They may exhibit repetitive motion; things like head bobbing, leg shaking or pacing in circles. This kind of action is more related to cognitive dysfunction or a degeneration of the brain. It\u2019s less likely to be mistaken for anything else,&quot; Dr. Petryk says. When to See the Vet You should also be aware of other behavioral changes, such as if your typically quiet dog now barks excessively, or if he barks at times when nothing is going on. If you notice any of these signs of \u201cdog dementia,\u201d discuss them with your veterinarian as soon as possible. By: Katherine Tolford Featured Image: iStock.com/Kara Arceneaux"}]
