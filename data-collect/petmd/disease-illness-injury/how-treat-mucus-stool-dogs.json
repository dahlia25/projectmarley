Although diarrhea is generally not a cause for major concern. Prolonged diarrhea or bloody diarrhea may signal a more severe medical problem and should be addressed by your veterinarian immediately while diarrhea may be a symptom of certain gastrointestinal diseases or infections more common causes include a change in diet or scavenging activities such as eating garbage or ingesting small objects. If your dog is not vomiting and is acting normally you can switch over to small portions of boiled chicken and plain white rice instead of feeding their normal food.\n\nIf your dog is vomiting you can remove food for about a 12 hour period and limit your dog to just quarter before introducing the chicken and rice combination. In either case make sure your dog drinks frequently to avoid dehydration feed small portions of the chicken and rice regularly until your dog's soul returns to normal. If the diarrhea does not resolve in 24 hours or you start seeing bloody or mucous coated stools you should call your veterinarian immediately and make an appointment for further evaluation. Your veterinarian may check for intestinal parasites food allergies bacterial infections tumors and metabolic issues.\n\nSometimes a diagnosis can be reached with a simple fecal examination while other times more invasive procedures like a colon Skippy or an ultrasound may be recommended to keep your dog diarrhea free. It's best to avoid sudden dietary changes and keep your table scraps away from your pup. Do not let your dog play with small objects that could result in intestinal blockage and ensure garbage and debris are always out of your dog's reach. If your dog's diarrhea is severe or reoccurring it's best to consult with your veterinarian regarding the best treatment options.", "potentialAction": {"@type": "SeekToAction", "target": "https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/digestive/how-treat-mucus-stool-dogs?wtime={seek_to_second_number}", "startOffset-input": "required name=seek_to_second_number"}}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "BreadcrumbList", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 0, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.petmd.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Diseases A-Z", "item": "https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "Article", "headline": "Mucus in Dog Poop: Causes and Treatment", "inLanguage": "en-US", "isFamilyFriendly": "True", "isAccessibleForFree": "True", "articleSection": "Digestive", "thumbnailUrl": "https://image.petmd.com/files/styles/863x625/public/French-bulldog-lying-in-grass.jpg", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://image.petmd.com/files/styles/863x625/public/French-bulldog-lying-in-grass.jpg"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jennifer Coates, DVM", "url": "https://www.petmd.com/author/dr-jennifer-coates"}, "keywords": "Dog, Condition, Digestive health, Symptom Checker, Mucus in Poop", "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "PetMD", "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.petmd.com/images/petmd_logo.png"}, "url": "https://www.petmd.com"}, "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/digestive/how-treat-mucus-stool-dogs"}, "datePublished": "May 19, 2020", "dateModified": "September 12, 2023", "description": "Is seeing a little bit of mucus in your dog\u2019s poop cause for alarm? Here\u2019s what a veterinarian has to say.", "articleBody": "Reviewed and Updated on May 19, 2020 by Dr. Jennifer Coates Your dog\u2019s poop can actually tell you a lot about their health. So before you pick it up, always take a quick peek to make sure your dog\u2019s poop looks normal. If you see mucus in your dog\u2019s stool, find out what could be causing it and when you should see the vet. Is Mucus in My Dog\u2019s Stool Dangerous? A little bit of mucus in a dog\u2019s stool is not a reason to panic, and there are some ways you can help at home. Be sure to mention these occurrences at your next vet visit. Excessive amounts of mucus in your dog\u2019s poop may indicate a medical condition that needs veterinary attention. If you consistently see mucus in your dog\u2019s stool, or you see a lot of mucus, even if it\u2019s just in one instance, then you need to make an appointment with your vet. It\u2019s best to contact your vet immediately if your dog is very young or very old or has a pre-existing condition. For these dogs, a decline in health can happen very rapidly, so you should communicate any changes you notice to your vet ASAP. When Can You Treat the Condition at Home? If your dog has just a little bit of excess mucus in their stool but is otherwise feeling fine (eating well, happy, active, no diarrhea, etc.), you can try treating the condition at home. Diet Sometimes switching to a highly digestible diet or adding additional fiber to their diet will help. Boiled white meat chicken (no skin or bones), white rice, and a teaspoon to a tablespoon (depending on the size of the dog) of canned pumpkin is a good, homemade option that you can safely feed your dog for a few days. Probiotics A small amount of mucus in the stool\u2014in an otherwise healthy dog\u2014does not require treatment with medications, but a probiotic supplement may help. Look for probiotic products designed specifically for dogs or ask your veterinarian for recommendations. When Does Mucus in Your Dog\u2019s Stool Require a Vet Visit? It\u2019s time for a vet appointment if your dog has abnormal amounts of mucus in their stool over an extended period of time, or if your dog has additional symptoms, such as: Poor appetite Weight loss Vomiting Diarrhea In these cases, there could be an underlying health issue at play. Your veterinarian will take a complete health history and perform a physical exam. They may need to run some combination of the following tests: Fecal examinations Bloodwork A\u00a0urinalysis Abdominal x-rays and/or ultrasound Endoscopy Biopsy of the intestinal tract\u00a0 Underlying Conditions and Treatments Appropriate treatment will depend on the results of these tests and your dog\u2019s eventual diagnosis. These are some of the more common disorders that cause mucus in dog stool: Intestinal Infections Bacteria, viruses, and fungi can all infect the canine\u00a0gastrointestinal\u00a0(GI) system. With GI infections, most dogs will also develop diarrhea, vomiting, loss of appetite, or other symptoms in addition to mucus in the stool. Supportive care and medications that address the infection will be necessary. Parasites Whipworms, tapeworms, giardia, and other intestinal parasites can cause mucus in a dog\u2019s stool. A fecal exam can identify the type of parasite present, and an appropriate dewormer should take care of the problem. Dietary Indiscretion When a dog eats something unusual, it can disrupt their GI tract and cause mucus in their stool. Mild cases resolve with a little bit of time. More severe cases may require medications to control vomiting and diarrhea, antibiotics, fluid therapy, nutritional support, and sometimes surgery to remove foreign material. Change in Diet/Adverse Food Reaction An abrupt change in diet can lead to mucus in a dog\u2019s stool. Returning to the original food and then slowly mixing increasing amounts of the new food into the old will usually resolve the problem. In some cases, a food allergy/intolerance may be to blame. You may need to switch to a therapeutic diet, like a veterinarian-prescribed hypoallergenic food. Irritable Bowel Syndrome Stress is thought to be a major factor in flare-ups of irritable bowel syndrome. Treatment involves stress relief, dietary changes, and medications (sulfasalazine, for example) that lessen the severity of a dog\u2019s symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0 Inflammatory Disorders Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can cause mucus in the stool, but it is usually accompanied by weight loss, vomiting, or diarrhea. Treatment with diet changes and sometimes immunosuppressive medications should reduce a dog\u2019s symptoms. Cancer Cancer of the GI tract can cause mucus in the stool. Treatment may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or\u00a0palliative\u00a0therapy. Acute Hemorrhagic Diarrhea Syndrome (AHDS) When a dog\u2019s stool contains a lot of blood and mucus (often described as looking like raspberry jam), AHDS\u2014also known as hemorrhagic gastroenteritis\u2014may be to blame. Treatment includes supportive care, anti-nausea drugs, fluid therapy, and antibiotics. Questions to Ask Your Veterinarian Ask your veterinarian about any possible side effects of the medications your dog is taking. Find out when they want to see your dog for a progress check and whom you should call if an emergency comes up outside of their normal business hours. Possible Complications to Watch For Talk to your veterinarian if you have any questions or concerns about your dog\u2019s condition, particularly if your dog experiences worsening symptoms like: Lethargy or depression Poor appetite Vomiting or diarrhea (especially if it is dark/tarry or contains fresh blood) Pain Remember, dogs that are very young or very old, or those that have pre-existing health conditions can quickly become very sick. In these cases, it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry and consult with a veterinarian ASAP.
