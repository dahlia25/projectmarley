The sinoatrial node (SA Node, or SAN), also called the sinus node, is the initiator of electrical impulses within the heart, triggering the heart to beat, or contract, by firing off electrical surges. Sinus arrest is a disorder of heart beat impulse formation caused by a slowing down or cessation of spontaneous sinus nodal automaticity \u2013 the automatic behavior of the tissues that set the pace for the heart&#039;s rhythm. It is the failure of the sinoatrial (SA) node to initiate an impulse at the expected time that leads to sinus arrest. Sinoatrial block is a disorder of impulse conduction. This is when an impulse formed within the sinus node fails to be conducted through the atria (the interior of the heart), or when it is delayed in doing so. More commonly, the basic rhythm of the sinus node is not disturbed when the impulses fail to conduct properly. Symptoms and Types     Usually asymptomatic (without symptoms)    Weakness    Fainting    Pale gums    Very slow heart rate, may be possible to detectSinoatrial block is classified into first, second, and third-degree SA block (similar to degrees of atrioventricular [AV] block). It is difficult to diagnose first and third-degree SA block from an electrocardiogram (ECG) reading only. Second-degree SA block is the most common type of SA block, and the only degree that can be recognized on a surface ECG. In addition, there are two types of second-degree SA blocks: Mobitz type I (also called Wenckebach periodicity)\u00a0 and Mobitz type II. First-degree sinoatrial block     Slowed conductionSecond-degree sinoatrial block     Failure to conduct is intermittent    Two types of second-degree SA block occur:    Mobitz type I/Wenckebach periodicity \u2013 speed of conduction slows gradually until failure of impulses to reach the atria occurs    Mobitz type II \u2013 block is all, or none, until complete conduction failure takes place    The two types cannot be differentiated on a surface ECGThird-degree sinoatrial block      Complete failure to conductCauses Physiologic     Vagal stimulation (i.e., stimulation of the vagus nerves of the pharynx), caused by coughing, and irritation of the pharynx (back of the mouth/beginning of throat)    High pressure in the eye, or carotid artery sinus (carries blood from the heart to the brain)    Surgical manipulationPathologic     Degenerative heart disease: heart grows tougher and less flexible    Dilatory heart disease: heart enlarges, and fails    Sudden inflammation of the heart    Cancer of the heart    Sick sinus syndrome (SSS): intermittent rapid and slow supraventricular arrhythmias    Irritation of vagus nerve, secondary to neck or chest cancer    Electrolyte imbalance: abnormal levels of potassium in blood    Drug toxicity (e.g., digoxin)Diagnosis Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your dog, with a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis. The electrolyte panel may show hyperkalemia, abnormal levels of potassium in the blood, which can lead to arrhythmias. You will need to give a thorough history of your dog&#039;s health, including a history of symptoms, and their onset. Thoracic (chest) x-rays and/or a cardiac ultrasound imaging may be taken by your veterinarian to confirm or rule out heart disease and abnormal tissue growth (neoplasia).\u00a0 A provocative atropine response test may be done to assess sinus node function. This test uses the drug atropine to stimulate the firing action of the SA Node. Dogs with SSS generally will have no response, or will have an incomplete response to the atropine.  Treatment Most dogs can be treated on an outpatient basis. Only patients showing clinical signs of illness should be hospitalized. Fluid therapy will be given to patients in need of it. If your dog is very ill patients and is not responding to medical therapy may require implantation of an artificial pacemaker, and will be hospitalized prior to surgery in preparation of it. If your dog becomes excessively weak, or is showing signs of losing consciousness, or fainting, it will need to have its activity restricted. Living and Management After care will be dependent on whether your dog has an underlying disease, along with the SA block. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments as necessary, and an ECG reading will be done at each visit to follow your dog&#039;s progress.\u00a0 If your dog becomes weak, or loses consciousness, contact your veterinarian immediately for advisement."}]
