He or she will then use routine laboratory tests including complete blood count, biochemistry profile, electrolyte panel, and urinalysis to assess the condition of your dog and severity of the disease. If your dog has Tyzzer disease, the biochemistry profile testing may reveal abnormally high levels of liver enzymes, especially shortly before the dog&#039;s condition becomes dire.
