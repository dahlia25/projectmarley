Gastrointestinal obstruction can be caused by any number of conditions.\n\nWhile it is most commonly due to ingestion of foreign bodies, tumors, hernias, gastroenteritis, which is an inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, pylori stenosis, an anatomical deformity, or even torsion, a twisting of the intestines or stomach, can also cause obstruction. All dogs can experience gastrointestinal obstruction. However, younger dogs and dogs that have a tendency to ingest foreign bodies are more susceptible.\n\nA blockage may occur either in the stomach or intestines, and can lead to vomiting, weight loss, weakness, diarrhea, and anorexia. Vomiting can cause severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. So seeking veterinary advice is crucial, as some obstructions can be life threatening.\n\nTreatment of gastrointestinal obstruction usually constitutes surgery to remove the obstructing body, in addition to treatments that address secondary effects of the obstruction, such as administration of IV fluids for dehydration. It is important to restrict your dog's activity after the initial treatment, as well as feed only bland foods for the first few days, followed by a gradual return to his or her normal diet.\n\nDogs with a habit of ingesting foreign objects tend to be repeat offenders. So take care to keep garbage bins and other items not made for consumption out of your dog's reach.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\n[BARKING]", "potentialAction": {"@type": "SeekToAction", "target": "https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/digestive/c_multi_gastrointestinal_obstruction?wtime={seek_to_second_number}", "startOffset-input": "required name=seek_to_second_number"}}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "BreadcrumbList", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 0, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.petmd.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Diseases A-Z", "item": "https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "FAQPage", "mainEntity": [{"@type": "Question", "name": "Can a dog \u202fpass an intestinal blockage?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Sometimes.

She also discusses treatment options, including surgery, for canine intestinal blockage.\u00a0", "articleBody": "What Is an Intestinal Blockage \u202fin Dogs? An intestinal blockage (obstruction)\u202fis a partial or complete blockage of the intestines that stops solid foods or liquids from passing through. This can prevent\u202fabsorption of water and nutrients, which can quickly cause the dog to become dehydrated and have imbalanced electrolytes (minerals that are important for the body to function).\u00a0\u00a0 Even worse, the blockage can damage the intestines\u202fby pressing on the intestinal wall and causing the tissue to die (necrosis) or break (bowel rupture or perforation). \u00a0 Symptoms of Intestinal Blockage in Dogs Vomiting: Persistent vomiting can lead to severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.\u00a0\u00a0 Loss of appetite (anorexia): Dogs may show no interest in eating. Young dogs with a foreign body obstruction (an object they shouldn\u2019t have eaten) will initially still eat, or try to, but\u202fthen vomit.\u202f\u00a0 Abdominal pain: An obstruction can press on the intestines, which can be very painful and even cause intestinal rupture or inflammation of the abdomen (peritonitis).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Weakness/lethargy: This can be caused by dehydration and/or an electrolyte imbalance as well as by pain.\u00a0\u00a0 Diarrhea/difficulty defecating (pooping)/Straining to defecate: A dog with a partial blockage may have diarrhea as liquid squeezes around the obstruction. If there is a complete blockage, the dog may try to defecate but\u202fwon\u2019t be able to.\u00a0\u00a0 Weight loss\u00a0 If your dog is vomiting but not producing stool (poop), this is a strong sign of an intestinal blockage.\u00a0\u00a0 Causes of \u202fIntestinal \u202fBlockage \u202fin Dogs Intestinal blockages are frequently caused by foreign bodies\u2014items the dog eats that cause an obstruction. Common items include bones, balls, toys, rocks, corncobs, cloth\u202f(such as underwear or socks), fruit pits, tampons, and linear objects (such as string, yarn, thread, ribbon, or pantyhose).\u202f\u00a0 However, blockages can also be caused by intestinal tumors or masses (abnormal new growths of tissue), especially in older dogs.\u00a0\u00a0 Other possible causes include:\u00a0\u00a0 Strictures (narrowing of intestines often due to scar tissue)\u00a0 Adhesions (bands of scar tissue from previous surgery)\u00a0 Intussusception\u202f(telescoping of the intestines where a portion of the intestine slides into an adjacent portion)\u00a0\u00a0 Severe intestinal parasite infestation\u00a0 Hernias\u00a0\u00a0 Torsion (twisting of the intestines)\u00a0\u00a0 Severe inflammation of the small intestines\u00a0 How Veterinarians Diagnose \u202fIntestinal Blockage \u202fin Dogs If you see or suspect that your dog has eaten a foreign object, you should seek immediate veterinary attention.\u00a0\u00a0 In some cases, the dog can immediately be made to vomit, bringing up the foreign object before it can cause an intestinal blockage. This should be done no more than\u202f30 minutes to\u202f2 hours after the dog ate the object.\u00a0\u00a0 If your dog is showing symptoms of an intestinal blockage, it is likely too\u202flate to induce vomiting. In this case, your veterinarian will start with a good physical examination, palpating (touching) the abdomen to check for pain or evidence of masses, foreign bodies, or intussusception. Sometimes your vet will be able to feel the actual obstruction, but often they won\u2019t. Most likely they will perform an abdominal x-ray for further evaluation.\u00a0 If the x-ray is inconclusive or your vet is looking for more information before recommending surgery, they may perform an abdominal ultrasound exam. This is very useful for showing images of foreign bodies but will also provide more information if a tumor or intussusception is suspected.\u00a0\u00a0 Bloodwork will likely also be recommended to rule out other causes of the symptoms and to check your dog\u2019s hydration and electrolytes. Treatment for\u202f Intestinal Blockage \u202fin Dogs Depending on the size of the dog, how sick they are, and the size of the foreign body, sometimes dogs can pass an object and poop it out in their stool. However, if it gets stuck and becomes an intestinal blockage, surgery will be needed to identify and remove the blockage.\u00a0\u00a0 Before surgery, your veterinarian may want to admit your dog into hospital, where they can receive IV fluids (to rehydrate them) as well as medication for nausea and pain.\u00a0 Once your dog has been stabilized, surgery is performed under anesthesia to identify the blockage. If a foreign object is the cause of the obstruction, sometimes an incision (cut) can simply be made into the intestines, the object removed, and the intestines sutured\u202f(closed) back up (this procedure is called an enterotomy).\u00a0\u00a0 However, if the intestines are damaged or there is dead tissue, sections of the intestines may need to be removed along with the cause of the obstruction, such as foreign body or tumor\u202f(this is called a resection and anastomosis). Recovery and Management of \u202fIntestinal Blockage \u202fin Dogs  Early diagnosis and treatment of intestinal blockage is important for a good outcome and to prevent complications (such as damage to the intestines, intestine rupture, leakage, splitting, or peritonitis). If surgery is needed. it should be performed as soon as possible.\u00a0\u00a0 After surgery, most dogs will need to remain hospitalized for 1-2 days on IV fluids and pain medications. They can usually go home after they start eating again, and if they are not vomiting. The recovery time is typical\u202ffor any abdominal surgery and includes 10-14 days of rest and restricted activity.\u00a0 Most dogs make a complete recovery and go back to their normal lives, but this can vary based on the cause of the intestinal blockage. If a foreign body was the cause of your dog\u2019s blockage, it\u2019s important to make sure they don\u2019t eat any foreign objects in the future, as complications are more likely when there is scar tissue from previous surgeries. If a tumor caused the blockage, the vet will send a sample to the lab to identify the type of tumor and the likely outcome.\u00a0\u00a0"}]
