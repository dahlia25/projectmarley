When a dog has a dislocated hip, also known as a coxofemoral\u00a0luxation, the ball part of the joint\u00a0comes out of the socket.\u00a0Dislocation disrupts\u00a0and can damage\u00a0the joint capsule (an outer layer of tough fibrous tissue that stabilizes the hip joint), in addition to the ligaments, muscle, and bones of the hip.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Symptoms of a Dislocated Hip in Dogs Dislocated hips in dogs are extremely painful. Dogs typically cannot bear weight on their back leg, often limping and carrying it so it will not touch the ground.\u00a0The affected leg may appear shorter than\u00a0the others.\u00a0The hip joint may also look swollen and be warm to the touch.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Causes of a Dislocated Hip in Dogs A dislocated hip in dogs is most commonly caused by trauma, such as being hit by a car. However, degenerative joint disease (arthritis or osteoarthritis), Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (or avascular necrosis of the femoral head), or hip dysplasia (malformation of the hip socket) also increases the risk.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How Vets Diagnose Hip Luxation in Dogs Often there is a history of trauma or injury that makes a veterinarian suspicious of a hip luxation in dogs. These dogs are x-rayed to check the positioning of their hips and confirm the luxation.\u00a0 In most cases, the bone slides forward and up (craniodorsal displacement), but the opposite can happen (ventrocaudal displacement). Knowing the position of the bones\u00a0helps your vet correct the problem.\u00a0 X-rays also provide additional information about the hip\u00a0status that can be important in selecting therapy. One example is when you have fractures of the pelvis or leg that would interfere with correcting the dog\u2019s hip luxation.\u00a0 Sometimes when ligaments tear during hip luxation in dogs, a bone chip can\u00a0come off as well. If the luxated hip were popped into place with a bone chip in the joint, this would cause painful bone-on-bone grinding.\u00a0Instead, the bone chip should be surgically trimmed.\u00a0 Another helpful piece of information found in the x-ray is if your dog has hip dysplasia (a malformation of the hip socket, making it too shallow to support the ball of the hip) or Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, a condition in which disrupted blood flow to the femur where it meets the pelvis\u00a0leads to death of the bone cells.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These cases warrant special consideration because manual joint replacement is unlikely to be successful, which means surgical correction is most likely needed.\u00a0 Treatment for Dislocated Hips in Dogs If you suspect that your dog has dislocated their hip, take them immediately to the emergency vet.\u00a0 There are two main approaches to correcting a dog\u2019s dislocated hip:\u00a0closed reduction (nonsurgical) and open reduction (surgical).\u00a0 Closed Reduction\u00a0\u00a0 Closed reduction is the nonsurgical technique that a veterinarian uses to put your dog\u2019s hip back in place manually. It is referred to as closed because you are not \u201copening\u201d the joint\u00a0with surgery.\u00a0 To have the best chance of success with a closed reduction, the vet will make sure that your dog\u2019s hip appears as normal as possible aside from\u00a0the dislocation,\u00a0meaning no fractures\u00a0and minimal hip dysplasia.\u00a0\u00a0 To further maximize the chances of success, the closed reduction should be attempted as soon as possible after the dislocation. If you wait any longer than one or two days, muscle contraction will occur that makes the reduction procedure much more difficult.\u00a0\u00a0 Since this procedure is painful and the muscles need to be relaxed, it needs to be attempted under general anesthesia.\u00a0The dog\u2019s femoral head, the highest part of the thigh bone, is manipulated back into the joint manually and then X-rayed to confirm it is in place.\u00a0 Once the hip joint is restored, a special support called an Ehmer sling is placed. The sling prevents your dog from using the leg and provides an angle that encourages the hip to remain in place.\u00a0\u00a0 Your dog needs to wear the sling for 10-14 days at home with frequent rechecks with your veterinarian, and be confined to a crate for an additional two to four weeks afterward.\u00a0 If successful, a closed reduction is a good\u00a0noninvasive option.\u00a0However, closed reductions to correct hip dislocation in dogs are only successful 50% of the time \u2013 meaning that the other 50% of the\u00a0time, the hip will pop back out, and surgery will be needed.\u00a0\u00a0 Still, most veterinarians agree it is\u00a0worth\u00a0the effort to attempt closed reduction for a dog\u2019s hip luxation before jumping to surgery.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Open Reduction\u00a0 If closed reduction fails or is deemed inadvisable because of trauma, fractures, or hip dysplasia, the vet will need to perform an open reduction.\u00a0This means surgery to put your dog\u2019s hip back into its normal position and stabilize it.\u00a0 There are several techniques to accomplish this.\u00a0The simplest approach to an open reduction is when the hip luxation only created a small tear in the joint capsule. The hip can be put back into place and the joint capsule can be sewn back together.\u00a0 However, in cases\u00a0where\u00a0the joint capsule is too damaged, the joint\u00a0may need to be reconstructed with a toggle pin or other implant to keep the femur in place.\u00a0Each case is different, so the veterinary surgeon will decide the best approach for your dog.\u00a0\u00a0 Post-operation, an Ehmer sling will likely be applied for approximately one week, followed by a few weeks to months of crate confinement and physical therapy.\u00a0 The success rate for open reduction is 85-90%, with a good range of motion and\u00a0return to normal activity expected.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are cases, however, where open reduction is not an option for treating a dog\u2019s dislocated hip because of existing arthritis, severe hip dysplasia, or severe trauma to the area. In these situations,\u00a0restoration of the normal hip joint is not possible, so the surgeon may need to do a femoral head osteotomy (FHO).\u00a0 This procedure eliminates the pain involved with bone-on-bone contact by removing the femoral head (ball)\u00a0altogether.\u00a0In this case, a false joint will develop\u00a0in the soft tissues, allowing nearly normal function of the leg.\u00a0 This technique will also require post-operative crate rest followed by physical therapy, but it does eliminate the risk of recurrent dislocation or the complications associated with implants.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Recovery and Management of Hip Luxation in Dogs Post-operative care will be based largely on how your dog was injured to cause the hip luxation (for example, if the dog was hit by a car). However, most recovery will include time spent in an Ehmer sling and crate rest, followed by\u00a0physical\u00a0therapy.\u00a0\u00a0 Typical recovery can involve up to six to eight weeks of restricted activity. Your veterinarian will customize a recovery plan for your dog.\u00a0 Initially,\u00a0your\u00a0vet will likely prescribe anti-inflammatory medications to reduce pain and swelling,\u00a0but in the long run, a joint supplement will be recommended to help maintain joint health and combat arthritis.\u00a0\u00a0 Another important aspect of long-term recovery from hip luxation in dogs is weight management, as obesity can exacerbate joint disease and pain.\u00a0 The most significant\u00a0short-term\u00a0complications are dislocating the hip again; implant issues such as loosening, fracture, or nerve damage; and infections. You must use caution while your dog is in recovery to ensure your dog is properly restricted and does not slip and fall.\u00a0\u00a0 If your dog seems to be in pain or not able to walk or uncomfortable during recovery, you should have them reexamined by their vet immediately\u00a0to ensure the hip has not moved out of place.\u00a0\u00a0"}]
