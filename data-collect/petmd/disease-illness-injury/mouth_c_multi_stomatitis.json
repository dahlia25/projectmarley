Stomatitis, also known as canine chronic ulcerative stomatitis (CCUS), affects a dog\u2019s gums, oral mucosa, tongue, and pharynx. It is known as a paradental disease because it does not attack the tissues that attach the tooth to the socket, it attacks the tissues that surround the teeth. It is believed that 5-10% of dogs with stomatitis also have other immune mediated diseases.\u00a0\u00a0 Symptoms of Stomatitis in Dogs Stomatitis can cause the following symptoms:\u00a0 Drooling\u00a0 Severe bad breath\u00a0 Pus-like oral discharge\u00a0 Decreased appetite\u00a0 Ulceration of parts of the tongue\u00a0\u00a0 Calculus (tartar) on the teeth, ranging from mild to severe\u00a0 Gingivitis, ranging from mild to severe\u00a0 Ulcerations on the areas of the cheek that contact teeth (otherwise known as \u201ckissing lesions\u201d)\u00a0 If a dog had previous dental cleanings that did not improve clinical signs, a veterinarian will determine whether stomatitis is a possible diagnosis.\u00a0 Causes of Stomatitis in Dogs The exact cause of stomatitis is unknown. We do know that stomatitis is an immune system response to calculus and plaque on the teeth. How Veterinarians Diagnose Stomatitis in Dogs A diagnosis of stomatitis is determined by taking a biopsy (a piece of tissue removed from the body for further evaluation) and histology (the study of microscopic structures of tissues).\u00a0\u00a0 Diagnostic testing is also used to rule out diseases that look similar to stomatitis before an appropriate treatment plan can occur. Similar diseases include:\u00a0 Bullous pemphigoid\u00a0 Pemphigus vulgaris\u00a0 Discoid lupus\u00a0 Erythematosus\u00a0 Systemic lupus erythematosus\u00a0 Erythema multiforme\u00a0 Treatment of Stomatitis in Dogs Treatment of stomatitis starts with a professional dental cleaning. The cleaning schedule for a dog with stomatitis should be every 3-4 months to help reduce the chances of a flare-up. This type of cleaning requires a dog to be sedated to allow for proper examination of the teeth and cleaning under the gum, as well as dental radiographs so that the health of each individual tooth can be assessed.\u00a0 If it is determined that a tooth is no longer viable, the tooth will be extracted. The vet may then place a sealant on the remaining teeth to slow down the decaying process. The patient is then sent home with anti-inflammatories, pain medication, and a rigorous at-home dental care schedule.\u00a0\u00a0 Recovery and Prevention of Stomatitis in Dogs At-home care is very intensive to keep the disease from progressing and allow the dog to live as comfortably as possible for as long as possible. This includes twice-daily removal of plaque on the teeth using a chlorhexidine-based product.\u00a0 If a flare-up occurs, dental wipes can be helpful until the pain subsides, as brushing is painful at this point. Once the pain is under control, routine daily or twice-a-day brushing can occur.\u00a0 In addition to rigorous at-home dental care, there are medications and supplements that may be helpful in slowing down the disease process.\u00a0\u00a0 Your veterinarian will be able to determine the best treatment plan, including necessary medications, depending on your dog\u2019s needs.\u00a0\u00a0"}]
