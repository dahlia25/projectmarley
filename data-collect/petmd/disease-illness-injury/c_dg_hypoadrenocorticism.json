Addison\u2019s disease in dogs (also called\u00a0hypoadrenocorticism)\u00a0occurs\u00a0when\u00a0your dog\u2019s adrenal glands aren\u2019t producing adequate levels of\u00a0corticosteroid hormones.\u00a0If diagnosed and treated appropriately these dogs can live a long, happy life.\u00a0 The adrenal glands are two small glands next to the kidneys.\u00a0The glands are responsible for producing corticosteroid hormones,\u00a0including the so-called \u201cstress\u201d hormones. The different types of corticosteroids are:\u00a0 Glucocorticoids\u00a0(such as cortisol):\u00a0Affect protein, sugar, and fat metabolism. These metabolites are stored\u00a0and will be\u00a0used in \u201cfight or flight\u201d situations\u00a0 Mineralocorticoids\u00a0(such as aldosterone):\u00a0Help control sodium and potassium.\u00a0 When animals (and humans) are under stress, the adrenal glands\u00a0are stimulated to produce stress hormones that may cause a range of internal and behavioral effects.\u00a0In dogs,\u00a0a stress response\u00a0can look like:\u00a0 Compulsively climbing the stairs\u00a0 Pacing and visibly anxious\u00a0 Interactions with other dogs\u00a0 Excitement when\u00a0you\u00a0come\u00a0home from work\u00a0 In a dog with Addison\u2019s disease, the adrenal glands don\u2019t produce enough hormones to maintain\u00a0normal stress levels.\u00a0Without our corticosteroid hormones to help us adapt to stressful situations, even the tiniest of stressors can cause\u00a0serious\u00a0issues and in severe cases, death.\u00a0\u00a0 Symptoms of Addison\u2019s Disease in Dogs  Addison\u2019s disease can be hard to detect by signs alone. Most commonly, Addison&#039;s disease is diagnosed as an\u00a0accidental\u00a0finding when annual blood work is\u00a0performed\u00a0and\u00a0your vet finds an\u00a0electrolyte imbalances. Your veterinarian may become suspicious if your dog has waxing and waning signs of lethargy, decreased appetite, vomiting,\u00a0and diarrhea.\u00a0\u00a0 Approximately 30% of dogs with Addison\u2019s disease are diagnosed\u00a0after experiencing an\u00a0Addisonian crisis. An Addisonian crisis\u00a0occurs\u00a0when a dog collapses in shock from the inability to adapt to external or internal stressors. This can lead to severely elevated potassium levels,\u00a0which can cause\u00a0abnormal heart rhythms\u00a0and a very slow heart rate. Addison\u2019s disease can also cause severe hypoglycemia (dangerously low blood sugar).\u00a0\u00a0 An Addisonian\u00a0crisis can only occur when about 90% of the adrenal cortex (the outer layer of the adrenal gland) is not functioning. This crisis can be fatal if shock is not treated quickly, aggressively, and appropriately.\u00a0 Causes of Addison\u2019s Disease in Dogs There are two types of hypoadrenocorticism:\u00a0 Primary hypoadrenocorticism:\u00a0This\u00a0occurs when your dog\u2019s immune system attacks the adrenal glands. Drug-induced necrosis (or death) of the adrenal gland is possible also with medications such as\u00a0ketoconazole,\u00a0trilostane,\u00a0and\u00a0lysodren.\u00a0\u00a0 Secondary hypoadrenocorticism:\u00a0This may occur when the releasing hormones produced in the brain are decreased. This can\u00a0be caused by\u00a0inflammation, cancer, brain trauma, or congenital abnormalities.\u00a0 Dogs with Addison\u2019s disease are usually young (most commonly around\u00a0three to six\u00a0years old),\u00a0though any age can be affected.\u00a0Typically,\u00a0female dogs are affected more often than male dogs. The most common breeds with Addison\u2019s disease\u00a0include:\u00a0 West Highland White Terriers\u00a0 Great Danes\u00a0 Basset Hounds\u00a0 Portuguese Water Dogs\u00a0 Airedale Terriers\u00a0 Standard poodles\u00a0 Bearded collies\u00a0\u00a0 Please\u00a0keep in mind that any dog of any breed or age can be affected.\u00a0 How Veterinarians Diagnose Addison\u2019s Disease in Dogs There are a couple of different ways that vets diagnose Addison\u2019s disease, including\u00a0getting a thorough\u00a0medical history,\u00a0thorough\u00a0physical\u00a0examination, full\u00a0blood\u00a0work,\u00a0and an ACTH stimulation blood test\u00a0(a test that investigates low cortisol). If the\u00a0dog responds\u00a0well to the treatment of shock with intravenous fluids and\u00a0steroid\u00a0administration, the veterinarian may suspect Addison\u2019s disease as an underlying cause of the shock.\u00a0 Full blood work can reveal elevated potassium and low sodium levels. Atypical, or unusual,\u00a0Addison\u2019s disease does not reveal these electrolytes changes on blood work\u00a0and is considered a\u00a0different type of Addison\u2019s disease.\u00a0Sometimes azotemia (or elevated kidney enzymes) can mimic kidney disease, while in less common instances, the blood sugar may be low,\u00a0which can mimic a pancreatic tumor (called an insulinoma).\u00a0\u00a0 The primary test used to diagnose Addison\u2019s disease is the ACTH test.\u00a0The test starts with\u00a0drawing\u00a0a\u00a0blood sample to measure the baseline cortisol (stress hormone) level,\u00a0followed by\u00a0administration of\u00a0an intravenous dose of ACTH,\u00a0the brain hormone that is responsible for releasing corticosteroids in times of stress.\u00a0\u00a0 One hour later, another blood sample is drawn to measure how your dog responded\u00a0to ACTH. If your dog\u2019s baseline cortisol is low and there is minimal response to the stress hormone, Addison\u2019s disease\u00a0can be diagnosed.\u00a0 Baseline cortisol levels are sometimes checked in emergency\u00a0situations. If they are low, a full ACTH stimulation blood test\u00a0may be\u00a0given when the\u00a0dog is\u00a0more stable. Sometimes, an abdominal ultrasound is performed\u00a0to identify\u00a0small adrenal glands.\u00a0\u00a0 Other blood tests can include urine cortisol creatinine\u00a0ratio, endogenous plasma ACTH levels, and plasma renin levels\u00a0(tests focusing on the dog\u2019s plasma levels).\u00a0Usually, these non-Addison\u2019s disease patients will have a normal ACTH stimulation test.\u00a0 Dog breeds originating from the Pacific Rim (such as Shiba\u00a0Inus\u00a0and Akitas) usually have elevated potassium levels on blood work. Keep in mind that whipworm infection can falsely raise potassium and drop sodium levels, which\u00a0may\u00a0cause confusion when diagnosing Addison\u2019s disease.\u00a0\u00a0 Treatment for Addison\u2019s Disease in Dogs In an Addisonian\u00a0crisis, treatment\u00a0focuses on\u00a0aggressive intravenous fluid therapy and injectable steroids. Treatment of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and/or\u00a0abnormal heart rhythms\u00a0might also be necessary.\u00a0Most dogs respond quickly\u00a0to treatment\u00a0and tend to make a complete recovery.\u00a0 The most important part of Addison\u2019s treatment is replacing the mineralocorticoids (like aldosterone,\u00a0which is the steroid\u00a0hormone). This can be done\u00a0through administering\u00a0oral medication (fludrocortisone) twice daily or\u00a0with an\u00a0injection\u00a0of\u00a0DOCP\u00a0(desoxycorticosterone\u00a0pivalate) approximately every 25-30 days.\u00a0Depending on your pet\u2019s diagnosis, you will be able to determine a treatment plan with your\u00a0veterinarian.\u00a0 If\u00a0your dog is\u00a0prescribed\u00a0fludrocortisone, it\u00a0has both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid activity.\u00a0In contrast, dogs receiving the injectable DOCP require additional glucocorticoid supplementation (such as oral\u00a0prednisone),\u00a0since it only has mineralocorticoid activity.\u00a0\u00a0 Some experts believe that DOCP better regulates electrolytes than oral fludrocortisone, but it usually comes down to preference of each veterinarian and what formulation is best for the dog. For example, some dogs\u00a0do\u00a0not do well with injections,\u00a0while others are more difficult to orally medicate.\u00a0Your vet will be able to determine what works best for your dog based on their diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0 Electrolyte blood testing and ACTH stimulation testing are usually performed at different intervals after starting therapy,\u00a0typically on day 10, day 30, and day 90. Mineralocorticoid\u00a0medication usually gets adjusted\u00a0after\u00a0electrolyte levels are stable. Levels will be\u00a0monitored a few times a year\u00a0to ensure it\u2019s the correct level for the dog.\u00a0\u00a0 If your dog is under extra stress,\u00a0glucocorticoid dosing\u00a0can be\u00a0increased. For example, veterinary visits, car rides,\u00a0pet parents\u00a0going out of town, or other\u00a0activities\u00a0can cause stress to Addisonian dogs. Increasing the dose of steroids for a short time\u00a0may help prevent\u00a0lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea,\u00a0and especially\u00a0an\u00a0Addisonian\u00a0crisis.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Recovery and Management of Addison\u2019s Disease in Dogs Dogs going through\u00a0an\u00a0Addisonian crisis\u00a0are typically\u00a0treated with intravenous fluid therapy\u00a0to\u00a0correct electrolyte disturbances, steroids, and\u00a0medications\u00a0to correct abnormal heart rhythms. This treatment usually leads to a good chance of recovery and dogs tend to respond quickly.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management of Addison\u2019s disease is lifelong. Blood work monitoring\u00a0may be\u00a0frequent at the start of treatment and over the first three to six months while your veterinarian is determining the best medication dosing intervals.\u00a0Most\u00a0dogs with Addison\u2019s disease\u00a0do well after they\u2019re diagnosed and\u00a0live a long, happy life.\u00a0\u00a0"}]
