However, accidental exposure of dogs to these hormone replacement products can cause serious illness. Dogs are easily poisoned by these products. Hormone replacement products can also be poisoning to cats. If you would like to learn how they affect cats, please visit this page in the petMD health library. Symptoms and Types Symptoms associated with hormone replacement poisoning will vary depending on the sex of the dog.     Female Dogs \u2013 Signs      similar to being in heat, including a swollen vulva and bloody discharge will      be present in female dogs experiencing HRT toxicity, even if spayed.    Male Dogs \u2013 Extreme      attraction to female dogs as well as the possibility of swollen mammary      glands (breasts) and abnormally small penis. In unaltered dogs, testicular      atrophy (shrinking of the testicles) may also occur.    Hair loss may occur in      both male and female dogs.There is also concern that prolonged exposure to HRT products could cause bone marrow suppression leading to aplastic anemia (a severe blood disease) and possibly mammary tumors (breast cancer.) Causes Hormone replacement therapies are used in women to replace estrogen and treat symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes, mood swings and bone loss. HRT medications are commonly supplied as creams, gels, sprays or patches. Women are often advised to apply the medication to the wrists, inner elbows, or legs. Dogs typically become exposed by licking the HRT medication from a woman\u2019s skin. They may also be exposed by chewing on or licking discarded patches. Diagnosis Diagnosis relies on the appearance of expected clinical signs and known (or suspected) exposure to an HRT product. Estrogen levels can also be measured in the blood to confirm the diagnosis, if necessary.  Treatment Symptoms are often reversible by eliminating further exposure to the medication. However, symptoms may take months to resolve completely in some cases. Prevention     Women should apply hormone replacement therapy products to areas of the body that the dog is not likely to contact.    When applying HRT products, women should wear gloves. The gloves should be disposed of in a location inaccessible to the dog when finished.    Used patches and similar items should be discarded out of the dog\u2019s reach."}]
