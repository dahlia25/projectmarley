Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease of the synovial joints (common joints including hips and knees) and is the most frequent type of arthritis affecting dogs. This chronic disease occurs in roughly 25% of dogs and is irreversible.\u00a0\u00a0 Dogs with osteoarthritis experience a progressive loss of the articular cartilage surfaces of their joints. They also can develop small bony pieces within the joint as well as fibrosis (connective tissue) around the cartilage of the joint, leading to pain and impairment of limb function.\u00a0\u00a0Most cases of osteoarthritis in dogs occur as secondary conditions to diseases such as hip dysplasia and elbow dysplasia. Other contributing factors to OA include bodyweight, obesity, gender, exercise, and diet.\u00a0 Symptoms of Osteoarthritis in Dogs A pet parent will usually notice signs of osteoarthritis in dogs. Most commonly, dogs will show:\u00a0 Decreased willingness to play or exercise, as well as decreased energy in overall activity.\u00a0 Stiffness or lameness, such as a difficulty moving from sitting to standing.\u00a0 A change in their posture and gait.\u00a0 Dogs may try to protect themselves from pain by developing a bunny hop walk, sit in a way to leave the painful area extended, or overall appear weak or slouching when walking. Causes of Osteoarthritis in Dogs Osteoarthritis is classified as primary or secondary. Primary osteoarthritis tends to be idiopathic (unknown cause) or associated with aging. Secondary osteoarthritis refers to the condition occurring because of another condition, such as:\u00a0 Injury\u00a0 Hip or elbow dysplasia\u00a0 Cruciate tear\u00a0 Patellar luxation\u00a0 Age and weight play a factor in the development of osteoarthritis in dogs. Both primary and secondary osteoarthritis progress through a series of changes degrading the health of the joint, articular cartilage, joint capsule, synovial membrane, subchondral bone, and ligaments. How Veterinarians Diagnose Osteoarthritis in Dogs Osteoarthritis in dogs is diagnosed through physical exam and imaging tools. Typically, veterinarians start by observing the dog\u2019s gait patterns. Gait patterns include repetitive limb motions such as walking, trotting, or running. During a physical exam, a vet will feel for swelling or effusion (excess fluid in the joint) and note any decreased range of motion of joints.\u00a0 Your vet will check for thickening around the joint, crepitus (rubbing and friction of bone and cartilage), or muscle atrophy (differences) in muscle size between similar joints. The exam may be done with your dog sedated to prevent pain. \u00a0 In addition to a physical exam, your vet may recommend:\u00a0 Radiographs (X ray)\u00a0 Bloodwork, if medication is to be prescribed\u00a0 Joint fluid analysis, to rule out infection or, in some cases, cancer\u00a0 Imaging tests, such as CT or MRI\u00a0 Force plate gait analysis, which measures the force exerted between a paw and the ground when walking or standing still\u00a0 Endoscopy of the affected joints, using a specialized thin tubing with a tiny camera and instruments that can visualize and sometimes treat problem areas\u00a0 Treatment of Osteoarthritis in Dogs Your veterinarian has many ways to slow the progression of OA and will often use multiple approaches to find what works best for your dog. \u00a0\u00a0Over-the-counter medications and supplements may be prescribed, but it is important to follow your vet\u2019s guidance carefully, as some medications may be fatal, and others have a low safety margin.\u00a0\u00a0 Commonly prescribed therapies include:\u00a0 Supplements: Such as omega 3 fatty acids, glucosamine/chondroitin, and other natural anti-inflammatory products. \u00a0\u00a0 NSAIDs to decrease inflammation and pain: Common drugs include carprofen, deracoxib, firocoxib, grapiprant, meloxicam, and others. These drugs can have side effects and not all dogs can tolerate them. Your veterinarian will recommend the best choice for your dog.\u00a0\u00a0 Steroids: Such as prednisone, methylprednisolone, and triamcinolone. Steroid medications can have many side effects and must be handled carefully.\u00a0\u00a0 Other pain medications that work with NSAIDs or through a different approach: These include gabapentin (anti-convulsant drug with analgesic properties), tramadol (synthetic opiate like agonist), and amantadine (NMDA receptor antagonist that may reverse central pain sensitization).\u00a0\u00a0 Adequan: An injectable prescription product that has anti-inflammatory effects. Many dogs experience significant comfort and minimal side effects with the use of Adequan as part of their pain reduction plan.\u00a0 Alternative therapies may be helpful for dogs with osteoarthritis. These include acupuncture, laser therapy, and physical rehabilitation including hands on techniques and therapeutic exercise. Chiropractic manipulation and stem cell therapy have also been helpful for some dogs. There has been some promising research and individual success stories regarding these therapies.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In some cases, surgery may be suggested to limit pain associated with the inflammation.\u00a0\u00a0 Recovery and Management of Osteoarthritis in Dogs Your veterinarian may suggest lifestyle changes for a dog with OA. Weight loss and management is essential to reduce inflammation and stress on the joints. A vet may suggest a prescription diet along with regular exercise, when the dog is able to tolerate movement.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If your vet recommends surgical intervention, a rehabilitation and physical plan will be prescribed. This often includes rehabilitation, physical therapy, massages, swimming and the underwater treadmill."}]
