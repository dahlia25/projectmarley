Parathyroid hormone and vitamin D interactions work to release calcium from the bones, gut, and kidneys for deposit into the bloodstream. When these interactions are disturbed, or when cancerous cells secrete hormones that interfere with calcium regulation, hypercalcemia can result. Hypercalcemia is characterized by an abnormally high amount of calcium in the blood. A dog is considered hypercalcemic when its total serum calcium is greater than 11.5 mg/dL. Symptoms and Types Increased urinationIncreased thirstLack of appetite (anorexia)VomitingDecreased gastrointestinal functionConstipationLack of energy/fatigue/lethargyConfusionDepressionEnlarged lymph nodes (swelling in neck)Bladder stonesHypertensionStupor and coma in severe casesCauses Abnormal or over functioning of the parathyroid gland (hyperparathyroidism)Cancer or tumorsBone deteriorating diseasesKidney failure - sudden or long-termUnder-functioning adrenal glandsVitamin D poisoning: from rodenticides, plants, or food (supplements included)Aluminum toxicityDiagnosis Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam, with a blood chemistry profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. While a high serum is crucial to the diagnosis of hypercalcemia, the results of the other tests will help to indicate the origin of the hypercalcemia. Radiograph and ultrasound imaging can also be used for diagnosing underlying conditions, such as kidney disease, bladder stones, or cancer. Fine needle aspirates (liquids) from the lymph nodes and bone marrow can be used for diagnoses of lymphoma, or cancer of the blood.  Treatment If your dog has been diagnosed with hypercalcemia, your veterinarian will very likely want to hospitalize it for fluid therapy. Once the primary disease is diagnosed, your dog will be given the appropriate medication(s). Your doctor will continue to check your dog\u2019s serum calcium twice a day during its stay at the veterinary clinic, until calcium levels have returned to normal. Living and Management \u00a0 Your veterinarian will set up a schedule of follow-up appointments for your dog dependent on the underlying cause of the hypercalcemia."}]
