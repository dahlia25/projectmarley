The term \u201cnasal dermatoses\u201d describes skin issues that can affect both the hairy part of a dog\u2019s muzzle (nasal bridge) and/or the hairless part of the nose with the nostrils (nasal planum).\u00a0 Most conditions affect the junction between the two\u2014an area called the mucocutaneous junction.\u00a0 Symptoms of Nasal Dermatoses in Dogs Signs of a possible nasal dermatosis in a dog include:\u00a0 Hypopigmentation (a loss of pigment) of the nasal planum Hyperpigmentation (excess pigment) of the nasal planum\u00a0 Ulceration (sores)\u00a0 Crusting\u00a0 Swelling\u00a0 Redness\u00a0 Scabbing\u00a0 Bumps\u00a0 Oozing lesions\u00a0 Most of the diseases that cause nasal dermatoses in dogs have very similar symptoms. This makes it hard to diagnose this condition just by looking at it.\u00a0 Causes of Nasal Dermatoses in Dogs The four most common causes of nasal dermatoses in dogs include:\u00a0 Bacterial infection (pyoderma/mucocutaneous pyoderma) Demodicosis (Demodex mites in the skin)\u00a0 Dermatophytosis (ringworm)\u00a0 Autoimmune disorders Bacterial Infection\u00a0 Pyoderma is a skin infection, most commonly caused by bacteria. It is usually superficial, affecting only the upper layers of skin and hair follicles. Bacterial pyoderma around the nose can also cause hypopigmentation (loss of pigment), crusting, oozing, and ulceration (sores).\u00a0 Bacteria such as Staphylococcus and Streptococcus are common causes of pyoderma in dogs. Malassezia yeast, which grows naturally on the skin but can grow too fast in cases of infection, is often found on affected skin along with the bacteria.\u00a0 Demodicosis\u00a0 Demodicosis is a condition caused by the microscopic Demodex mite. It is also known as demodectic mange.\u00a0 These mites normally live on the dog\u2019s skin, but they can reproduce quickly and cause skin lesions in young dogs or dogs with weakened immune systems. You may see lesions around the nostrils (hairless nasal planum). Dermatophytosis (Ringworm) Dermatophytosis is the clinical name for ringworm. Ringworm is not caused by a worm or parasite, but by a fungus (most often Microsporum canis).\u00a0 Because ringworm lesions are often not ring-shaped and can look like many other types of skin conditions, they can be easy to miss. Dermatophytosis is most common in young animals or animals with a weakened immune system. However, it can also affect healthy adult animals.\u00a0 Autoimmune Disease\u00a0 If infection and mites are ruled out, it may be time to consider autoimmune disease. Diagnosing an autoimmune disease in your dog will usually require taking a small sample of skin (biopsy).\u00a0 Autoimmune conditions such as pemphigus, lupus erythematous, uveodermatologic syndrome, and cancers like cutaneous lymphoma, can look identical to a skin infection, Demodex mites, or ringworm.\u00a0\u00a0 How Veterinarians Diagnose Nasal Dermatoses in Dogs A vet can identify nasal dermatoses by doing a physical exam, but tests for the following underlying conditions are necessary to figure out what\u2019s causing the condition. Diagnosing Pyoderma in Dogs Pyoderma in dogs is diagnosed through a procedure called skin cytology. During this test, the vet will take a sample of inflamed, crusted skin and examine it under a microscope.\u00a0In some cases, a biopsy and/or culture of the skin may also be recommended.\u00a0 Diagnosing Demodicosis in Dogs Demodex mites are diagnosed with a skin scraping, although it can be hard to find them because they live deep in the hair follicles.\u00a0 A skin scraping can be done in your vet\u2019s office. The test consists of massaging a small area of your dog\u2019s skin to squeeze any Demodex mites out of the hair follicles. A scalpel blade is then used to gently scrape a sample away from the top layer of skin. This sample is then examined under a microscope.\u00a0 While a skin scraping may cause some rawness and mild bleeding, it is well-tolerated and not invasive. \u00a0 Diagnosing Dermatophytosis in Dogs Diagnosing dermatophytosis can be tricky because it often requires a fungal culture, which can take weeks to return a result. It may also be diagnosed by examining a sample of affected skin or hair under a microscope.\u00a0 The fungal organism can sometimes be seen on skin and hair samples, but a fungal culture or other specialized testing (like a fungal PCR test, which confirms the presence of ringworm DNA) may be necessary to rule out dermatophytosis.\u00a0 In some cases, a Wood\u2019s lamp, which is a special lamp used to examine skin and eye lesions, will cause affected hairs to fluoresce (glow bright yellow) in the dark.\u00a0 While a positive Wood\u2019s lamp test does confirm a ringworm diagnosis, a negative Wood\u2019s lamp test does not rule out ringworm, as only a fraction of ringworm infections will actually glow.\u00a0 Treatment for Nasal Dermatoses in Dogs The treatment for nasal dermatoses depends on the underlying cause.\u00a0 A simple topical antifungal or antibiotic may be recommended for mild cases of pyoderma, while an autoimmune disease will likely require long-term oral medication.\u00a0 Flea and tick preventatives in the isooxazoline class (such as Bravecto, Credelio, Nexgard, and Simparica Trio) will kill the mites that cause demodicosis, although this would be considered off-label use.\u00a0 Once your veterinarian has determined the underlying cause of the dermatosis, they will be able to give more treatment information.\u00a0\u00a0 Recovery and Management of Nasal Dermatoses in Dogs Recovery and management of nasal dermatoses in dogs also depend on the underlying cause of the skin issue.\u00a0 Pyoderma and dermatophytosis (ringworm) can usually be fully cured with the correct treatment.\u00a0 Skin mites can be treated and prevented with certain types of flea and tick preventatives, although dogs with skin mites may also have coexisting skin infections that need treatment.\u00a0 Treating autoimmune diseases may be a bit more complicated. Depending on the type, it may require more than one medication and long-term treatment.\u00a0"}]
