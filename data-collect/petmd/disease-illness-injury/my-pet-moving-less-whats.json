Arthritis is the most common cause of decreased mobility in both dogs and cats.\u00a0 Technically called degenerative joint disease (DJD) it occurs when abnormal movements in the joints cause erosion of cartilage.\u00a0 This will progress to bone rubbing on bone which itself is very painful and leads to inflammation.\u00a0 The inflammatory process creates a vicious cycle resulting in chronic pain for your pet.\u00a0 Factors such as obesity, overly active lifestyle, joint conformation and genetic factors can contribute to this process. The most obvious sign of joint disease is when a dog or cat starts limping, usually right after they have been resting or lying down. However, there are numerous other subtle signs that may indicate your pet is uncomfortable.\u00a0 Perhaps your dog doesn\u2019t charge up the stairs like he used to. Maybe your older pet seems to be \u201cslowing down.\u201d\u00a0 Cats may start urinating or defecating out of the litter box because it is too painful for them to jump into it.\u00a0 These are just a few examples. Bottom line: if you notice any changes in your pet\u2019s behavior, talk with your veterinarian immediately. Treatment Early treatment for arthritis can be as simple as switching to a prescription diet or starting supplements.\u00a0 The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil act as a strong anti-inflammatory for the joints.\u00a0 There are several glucosamine and chondroitin supplements on the market that help repair cartilage damage.\u00a0 I recommend looking for a glucosamine and chondroitin supplement that also contains avocado/soybean unsaponifiables, Boswellia and green-lipped muscle. For your pet\u2019s safety, consult your veterinarian for guidance in selecting and dosing over the counter supplements. For more advanced disease you should speak with your veterinarian about starting pain medication, acupuncture or physical therapy. Traumatic injury resulting in a muscle strain or ligament tear can result in pain with decreased activity.\u00a0 These types of injury usually present suddenly and resolve with pain medication and rest.\u00a0 If it is something more involved like a cruciate ligament tear the pet will usually need surgical correction for full return to function and to avoid developing secondary arthritis.\u00a0 Your veterinarian can help determine the extent of your pet\u2019s injury. Non-Arthritic\u00a0Conditions Neurologic conditions such as intervertebral disk disease, inflammatory conditions in the brain and spinal fluid or tumors of the spine can affect mobility in a variety of ways.\u00a0 The most common clinical sign in these diseases is weakness or paralysis in one or multiple limbs.\u00a0 You can also see neck or back pain, decreased appetite, lethargy and fever.\u00a0 If you are concerned that your pet is experiencing these signs, please seek veterinary care immediately. Certain cancers of the bones and cartilage can cause limping and decreased mobility.\u00a0 These cancers are very painful and readily diagnosed with x-rays.\u00a0 Pets are so adept at hiding their pain from us that we often don\u2019t see any clinical signs until they stop putting any weight on the affected limb or develop a pathologic fracture.\u00a0 Again early detection is essential for managing and treating these conditions as well as helping keep your pet from experiencing chronic discomfort.\u00a0 Cats and rarely dogs can develop neurologic disease secondary to diabetes.\u00a0 This is usually seen as weakness in the hind limbs called a \u201cplantigrade stance\u201d where the pet\u2019s hocks are dropped almost touching the ground.\u00a0 If you notice this in your pet speak with your veterinarian about testing them for diabetes.\u00a0 If caught early and insulin therapy is started, diabetic neuropathy can be reversible. Hearing can Affect Mobility Finally decreased hearing can result in your dog or cat not leaping off the sofa to greet you when you walk in the door.\u00a0 Unfortunately there isn\u2019t much we can do to test or treat for this, but it is good information to discuss with your veterinarian to make sure there isn\u2019t something more serious going on. A dog or cat\u2019s activity level and mobility can tell us a lot of important information about their overall health, especially as they age.\u00a0 Any changes, either subtle or drastic, should be discussed with your veterinarian.\u00a0 Treatment could be as simple as adding in a supplement or additional tests may be necessary to make sure your pet is healthy and pain free."}]
