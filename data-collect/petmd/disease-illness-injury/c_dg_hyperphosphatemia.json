Hyperphosphatemia is the term for high phosphorus levels in the blood. Phosphorus is a mineral found in bones\u00a0that, together with calcium, helps to build strong,\u00a0healthy\u00a0bone\u00a0structure. Phosphorus also helps\u00a0to\u00a0maintain cell structures and aids in cell energy production. Most of the phosphorus in a dog\u2019s body is\u00a0stored\u00a0in bone, but a small percentage is present in the blood.\u00a0\u00a0 Calcium\u00a0and phosphorus have an inverse relationship. When phosphorus levels in the blood are high, calcium levels tend to be lower.\u00a0For this reason, clinical signs of high phosphorus\u00a0correlate\u00a0with clinical signs of too little calcium in the blood (hypocalcemia).\u00a0 Phosphorus is absorbed in the small intestine and\u00a0is\u00a0released in the urine. The kidneys and parathyroid glands are important in maintaining\u00a0phosphorus\u00a0levels. Diseases associated with the kidneys, bones, parathyroid gland, or gastrointestinal tract can\u00a0lead to hyperphosphatemia. The most common disease leading to hyperphosphatemia is chronic renal failure (CRF).\u00a0 Symptoms of Excess Phosphorus Levels in the Blood of Dogs Signs of kidney disease can be seen in cases of chronic, or long-lasting, hyperphosphatemia. These symptoms include increased thirst and urination, diluted urine, dehydration, or\u00a0inappropriate urination. In animal\u00a0that already have been diagnosed with chronic renal failure, hyperphosphatemia can speed up the progression of\u00a0this disease.\u00a0 In high levels, phosphate can combine with calcium to create a solid. This causes a syndrome called metastatic mineralization, which means the decomposition of chemical compounds\u00a0in\u00a0otherwise normal tissues. The most common body systems a\ufb00ected by metastatic mineralization are the urinary system (the kidneys in particular) and the gastrointestinal system. Symptoms of metastatic mineralization can include muscle tremors, muscle atrophy, or seizures.\u00a0 Hyperphosphatemia in dogs can also cause lethargy, depression, or\u00a0loss\u00a0of\u00a0appetite.\u00a0 Causes of Excess Phosphorus Levels in the Blood of Dogs Young, growing dogs can have higher phosphorus levels due to increased growth hormone in their systems and increased need for phosphorus for bone development. Older dogs are more likely to have diseases that will eventually lead to the development of\u00a0chronic\u00a0\ufffchyperphosphatemia.\u00a0 Kidney disease is the most common cause of hyperphosphatemia in dogs. However, it can also be related to increased absorption of phosphorus through the gastrointestinal tract or through\u00a0\ufffctranscellular shifting\u00a0(transport of solutes by a cell through a\u00a0cell) of phosphorus, usually from bone.\u00a0 Hyperphosphatemia can also be related to:\u00a0 Vitamin D toxicity\u00a0\u00a0 Enema intoxication through the use of phosphate-containing enemas\u00a0\u00a0 Urinary tract obstruction\u00a0 Endocrinopathies (hyperthyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, hypoadrenocorticism)\u00a0 Cancer\u00a0\u00a0 Nutritional supplementation\u00a0\u00a0 Bladder rupture\u00a0\u00a0 Bone or muscle disease\u00a0\u00a0 Xylitol intoxication\u00a0 Snakebites\u00a0 Acromegaly (overproduction of growth hormone)\u00a0 Occasionally, phosphorus will be elevated in cases of serious trauma\u00a0or in\u00a0conditions\u00a0such as\u00a0acute tumor lysis syndrome (seen most commonly with end stage tumors) and rhabdomyolysis, which is a muscular disorder.\u00a0 How Veterinarians Diagnose Hyperphosphatemia in Dogs Hyperphosphatemia is diagnosed through a blood work profile called a biochemistry panel. Other diagnostic methods may be needed to discover the underlying cause of hyperphosphatemia. Those include imaging or additional bloodwork (such as thyroid testing or\u00a0a complete blood count). Treatment for Hyperphosphatemia in Dogs Hospitalization may be needed in severe cases of hyperphosphatemia. Your dog may receive IV fluid therapy and medications such as dextrose, insulin, aluminum hydroxide, or calcium carbonate that can help to decrease phosphorus in the blood.\u00a0 When dogs are diagnosed with chronic elevations of blood phosphorus, they are commonly\u00a0treated orally with phosphate binders. Dietary restriction of phosphorus is recommended through switching your dog\u00a0to a low protein or prescription renal care diets. Because phosphorus and calcium bind together, in some cases restricting calcium intake is also recommended.\u00a0 In all cases of hyperphosphatemia, the underlying cause must be found and correctly treated to have the best outcome for your dog.\u00a0 Recovery and Management of Hyperphosphatemia in Dogs Bloodwork is recommended at regular intervals in patients that have experienced frequent episodes of hyperphosphatemia or have a disease that causes hyperphosphatemia.\u00a0Once diagnosed,\u00a0it can be possible for the\u00a0condition\u00a0to\u00a0be managed at home with medications including oral phosphate binders\u00a0or\u00a0phosphate-restricted diets.\u00a0 Dogs with acute cases of hyperphosphatemia that occur because of issues like vitamin D toxicity should recover fully after treatment with IV fluid therapy and use of medications\u00a0for binding\u00a0the phosphorus\u00a0and are unlikely to require lifelong, at home management.\u00a0"}]
