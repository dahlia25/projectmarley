Dogs have four pairs of salivary glands located within the jaw or neck region. These glands create saliva that is excreted into your dog\u2019s mouth. Similar to other types of glands, cancer can form in the salivary glands. The most common type of salivary gland cancer in dogs is adenocarcinoma. This is an aggressive and\u00a0malignant type of cancer that needs to be\u00a0diagnosed and treated by a veterinarian.\u00a0 Dogs have\u00a0four pairs of salivary glands\u00a0that\u00a0are located\u00a0below the eye\u00a0(zygomatic), behind the\u00a0jawbone\u00a0where the neck meets the jaw\u00a0(mandibular), under the tongue\u00a0(sublingual), and around the base of the ear\u00a0(parotid).\u00a0The gland\u00a0most affected\u00a0by adenocarcinoma is the parotid gland.\u00a0\u00a0 There are also multiple accessory salivary glands located throughout the mouth in the lips, cheeks, and palate.\u00a0Salivary gland adenocarcinoma occurs\u00a0when cells\u00a0that line the salivary glands\u00a0grow out of control and create a tumor.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Symptoms of Salivary Gland Adenocarcinoma in Dogs  Dogs with adenocarcinoma can\u00a0develop symptoms, depending on the size and location of a tumor.\u00a0Symptoms may\u00a0include:\u00a0 Bad\u00a0breath\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Drooling\u00a0 Difficulty swallowing\u00a0\u00a0 Changes in your dog\u2019s voice (barking)\u00a0 Firm, painless swelling\u00a0near a\u00a0salivary gland\u00a0\u00a0 One eye bulging out\u00a0\u00a0 Swelling\u00a0of the\u00a0lips, cheeks, near the ear/upper neck,\u00a0or under the tongue\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Causes of Salivary Gland Adenocarcinoma in Dogs  We don\u2019t know what causes salivary gland adenocarcinoma.\u00a0Although\u00a0many\u00a0cancers\u00a0can result from\u00a0environmental and/or genetic factors, there are no known genetic or environmental causes of salivary gland adenocarcinomas.\u00a0 How Veterinarians Diagnose Salivary Gland Adenocarcinoma in Dogs  If your vet suspects a salivary gland adenocarcinoma, they will perform an examination. This may include reviewing the dog\u2019s health record and discussing any symptoms you\u2019ve noticed,\u00a0including difficulty swallowing or eating, bad breath,\u00a0or other symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0 Fine Needle Biopsy You veterinarian may perform\u00a0a fine needle biopsy to\u00a0collect cells from the tumor to\u00a0examine under a microscope.\u00a0During this procedure, your vet will use a very fine needle to collect a small sample of cells from the tumor. These cells will be examined under a microscope\u00a0to\u00a0determine if they\u00a0are\u00a0cancerous\u00a0versus\u00a0caused by an infection or inflammation.\u00a0\u00a0 X-Ray\u00a0 If\u00a0abnormal cells are\u00a0present, your vet\u00a0may recommend x-rays of the skull and neck to look for changes in the bone near the\u00a0affected\u00a0salivary gland.\u00a0 Surgical Biopsy\u00a0 During a surgical biopsy, your veterinarian will\u00a0remove\u00a0either all or part of the tumor in a surgical procedure.\u00a0This\u00a0removed tissue\u00a0will be sent to a medical\u00a0specialist\u00a0called a pathologist\u00a0to\u00a0examine\u00a0the\u00a0tissue\u00a0and make a diagnosis.\u00a0 Treatment for Salivary Gland Adenocarcinoma in Dogs  The primary treatment of\u00a0salivary gland adenocarcinoma\u00a0is\u00a0surgery to remove the tumor.\u00a0However,\u00a0before\u00a0surgery\u00a0your vet\u00a0may\u00a0also perform tests to determine if the cancer has spread to other parts of the dog\u2019s body.\u00a0\u00a0 The process of cancer spreading is called metastasizing. Cancers are \u201cstaged\u201d depending on how far they have spread. The most common site for adenocarcinomas to spread to are nearby lymph nodes, but they may also spread to your dog\u2019s lungs.\u00a0Cancers that have metastasized may be treated differently than cancers that are confined to the original gland.\u00a0\u00a0 Once your vet has determined the cancer\u2019s stage, they may recommend further testing to help develop a treatment plan. Additional tests\u00a0can\u00a0include:\u00a0\u00a0 Complete blood\u00a0chemistry\u00a0 Urinalysis\u00a0 X-rays of the lungs, and/or an ultrasound of the abdomen\u00a0\u00a0 Because salivary gland adenocarcinoma is often aggressive,\u00a0your vet may also suggest\u00a0a CT scan or\u00a0MRI\u00a0to\u00a0examine\u00a0the area\u00a0around the gland.\u00a0 Radiation Therapy\u00a0 Adenocarcinoma\u00a0is often very aggressive and\u00a0can\u00a0spread to nearby parts of the\u00a0face,\u00a0including\u00a0large blood vessels and nerves, or the lungs. In these instances, your vet may not be able to completely remove the tumor and may recommend radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is also\u00a0used\u00a0to treat\u00a0tumors that cannot be removed with surgery\u00a0because of\u00a0their location.\u00a0\u00a0 Chemotherapy\u00a0 If\u00a0tests indicate the cancer has\u00a0spread to other areas of the body,\u00a0your veterinarian may prescribe\u00a0chemotherapy.\u00a0 Recovery and Management of Salivary Gland Adenocarcinoma in Dogs  Recovery from surgery\u00a0requires\u00a0your\u00a0dog\u00a0to\u00a0rest comfortably at home. Your veterinarian may also prescribe medicine to ease pain and reduce\u00a0inflammation,\u00a0along with antibiotics to prevent infection. Your dog will also require\u00a0follow-up visits\u00a0to your veterinarian and possibly\u00a0radiation therapy,\u00a0depending on your vet\u2019s diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0"}]
