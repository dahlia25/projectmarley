Learn more about caring for Doberman Pinscher puppies and dogs.", "articleBody": "The Doberman Pinscher is thought to have been first bred by Louis Dobermann, a German tax collector, in the late 1800s. According to the Doberman Pinscher Club of America (DPCA), he likely crossed Old German Shepherds (a now-extinct breed different than today\u2019s German Shepherds), German Pinschers, Black and Tan Manchester Terriers, and Greyhounds. The Doberman Pinscher is a loyal dog known for being intelligent and alert. While often kept as a family dog, this breed is also commonly used for security, police work, and search and rescue.\u00a0 As a large dog breed, the Doberman\u2019s size typically reaches 24\u201328 inches tall, and the dogs weigh anywhere between 60\u2013100 pounds.\u00a0 Caring for a Doberman Pinscher Doberman Pinschers are energetic dogs. They are also curious and intelligent, and so require an active lifestyle that keeps them both physically and mentally stimulated. Without consistent exercise, Dobermans will seek out their own entertainment, which can lead to destructive and unwanted behaviors. Due to their high energy level, they are not always an ideal pet for families with very young children.\u00a0 Doberman Pinschers are also known for loyalty and love of family, and this can lead them to be wary around new people. Pet parents must train and socialize their Doberman puppy early and consistently. Doberman dogs have a strong prey drive, so they may not be the ideal pet for families with other small animals in the home, such as guinea pigs, rabbits, or cats. And it\u2019s important to keep your Doberman on a leash or inside a fence when they\u2019re outside, as they may chase after neighborhood squirrels. Doberman Pinscher Health Issues The Doberman lifespan is 10\u201312 years, and they\u2019re considered a healthy breed. But they can develop a few health issues pet parents should know to look out for.\u00a0\u00a0 Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus\u00a0\u00a0 Gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV)\u00a0is a severe form of bloat in dogs. It\u2019s a condition that comes on suddenly and requires immediate life-saving intervention. GDV occurs when the stomach fills up with food or gas that causes expansion and increased pressure. The stomach can then rotate, which in turn causes inadequate blood supply to the spleen and stomach. If the condition is not treated quickly, shock, tissue damage, and even death can occur.\u00a0\u00a0 Increased risk of GDV is seen in:\u00a0\u00a0 Large dogs with a deep chest, like Dobermans\u00a0 Dogs that are fed from elevated bowls\u00a0\u00a0 Dogs that are fed one big meal per day\u00a0 Symptoms of GDV include:\u00a0\u00a0 Distended abdomen\u00a0 Nonproductive retching\u00a0 Drooling\u00a0 Stretching\u00a0 Anxiety\u00a0\u00a0 Inability to settle or get comfortable These signs can progress to weakness, collapse, elevated heart and breathing rates, and poor blood flow.\u00a0 Immediate veterinary intervention is needed to stabilize and treat GDV. The longer a dog has this condition without intervention, the greater the risk of death. A prophylactic gastropexy can also be performed before GDV even occurs to secure the stomach in the right position. This procedure is often done at the same time as a dog\u2019s spay or neuter surgery and can help to prevent the stomach from twisting, although it can still bloat. Hypothyroidism\u00a0 Hypothyroidism\u00a0is a condition that causes an underactive thyroid gland, which controls metabolism. In hypothyroidism, the body either attacks its own glands or the gland is replaced with fat.\u00a0 Signs of hypothyroidism in a Doberman Pinscher include:\u00a0\u00a0 Weight gain\u00a0 Lethargy Brittle coat\u00a0 Skin and/or ear infections\u00a0 Increased cholesterol in the blood\u00a0 Hypothyroidism is diagnosed through blood work. It is treatable with a thyroid hormone replacement medication called\u00a0levothyroxine, which needs to be given for life.\u00a0 Dilated Cardiomyopathy\u00a0 Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)\u00a0is degeneration of the heart muscle that causes the muscle of the left ventricle to become very thin and pump weakly.\u00a0\u00a0 Symptoms of the disease may occur suddenly or progress gradually as it worsens over time. Congestive heart failure can occur secondary to DCM. Signs of DCM include:\u00a0 Exercise intolerance\u00a0 Weakness\u00a0\u00a0 Coughing\u00a0 Rapid breathing\u00a0 Increased breathing effort\u00a0 Restlessness\u00a0 Collapse\u00a0\u00a0 Sudden death\u00a0 Your vet may suspect DCM if these symptoms are observed or if your vet hears a heart murmur via the stethoscope. X-rays and/or an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) are used to further characterize and diagnose this disease.\u00a0 DCM is a very serious condition that requires intensive treatment, and not all dogs will return to normal. Medical treatment for DCM slows the progression and helps control the symptoms, including medications to:\u00a0 Control arrhythmias (anti-arrhythmics)\u00a0 Lower vascular pressure and increase muscle strength (pimobendan)\u00a0 Remove excess fluid from the body (diuretics)\u00a0 Lower blood pressure and resistance (ACE inhibitors)\u00a0 Slow the heart rate (cardiac glycosides)\u00a0 Dilate the blood vessels (vasodilators)\u00a0 A\u00a0correlation between DCM and grain-free diets\u00a0has been found, but it is not fully understood. Talk to your veterinarian about the risks and benefits of grain-free diets for Doberman Pinschers. Von Willebrand Disease\u00a0 Von Willebrand Disease\u00a0(vWD) is a genetic blood disorder that is seen in Doberman Pinschers more than some other breeds.\u00a0\u00a0 This disease causes a deficiency in a protein called the von Willebrand factor, which is necessary for platelets to stick together and form a clot. In dogs that are deficient in this protein, the blood may have difficulty clotting, which can lead to bleeding from the nose, vulva, bladder, or gums. Additionally, dogs with this condition may bleed for a long time after trauma or surgery.\u00a0 Because some dogs with vWD do not have notably prolonged bleeding until later in adulthood, blood levels of the von Willebrand factor can be measured to help with diagnosis. Many vets recommend testing for vWD prior to any planned surgery, including spays, neuters, and dewclaw removals.\u00a0 Hip Dysplasia\u00a0 Hip dysplasia\u00a0is a genetic disease that causes the hip joint to fit together abnormally. This is also influenced by growth rate, hormones, diet, and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0 Hip dysplasia happens when the hip joint is too loose, so the cartilage and bone begin to wear down. As the body attempts to stabilize the joint, degenerative joint disease and\u00a0osteoarthritis\u00a0may develop; arthritis, in turn, leads to pain, limping, and difficulty rising.\u00a0 Maintaining a lean body condition is important for preventing arthritis in Doberman Pinschers. Many vets recommend low-intensity exercise and supplements of omega-3 fatty acids, glucosamine, and chondroitin for dogs diagnosed with hip dysplasia.\u00a0 Hip dysplasia is diagnosed with X-rays of the hips. The hip joints may also feel loose on manipulation. When pain is present,\u00a0non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\u00a0are frequently prescribed to reduce inflammation and pain. Other modalities to control the pain include acupuncture and\u00a0laser therapy. If pain cannot be controlled,\u00a0surgery may be recommended.\u00a0 What To Feed a Doberman Pinscher Feeding commercial kibble or wet food approved by the\u00a0Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO)\u00a0is a good way to make sure your Doberman Pinscher receives a complete and balanced diet. Photo credit: Adobe/everydoghasastoryThese dogs need easily digestible protein for healthy muscles, including the heart. Inclusion of omega-3 fatty acids (DHA/EPA) in the diet supports healthy skin, coat, kidneys, and heart.\u00a0 How to Feed a Doberman Pinscher\u00a0 To reduce the risk of GDV or bloat, feed your Doberman dog two meals per day instead of one larger meal. Doberman Pinscher puppies need to eat more frequently, at least three meals every day. Avoid feeding your Doberman with an elevated food bowl, which can increase the risk of GDV or bloat. You should also not exercise your pup directly before or after eating. How Much to Feed a Doberman Pinscher\u00a0 The\u00a0recommended caloric intake\u00a0for Doberman Pinschers varies due to different physical sizes, metabolisms, and activity levels. The average size of a Doberman varies by about 40 pounds, so caloric needs also vary.\u00a0\u00a0 Talk to your veterinarian about how much to feed your Doberman. Nutritional Tips for Doberman Pinschers\u00a0 Talk with your veterinarian about adding omega-3 fatty acids (DHA/EPA) to your Doberman\u2019s diet. These act as natural anti-inflammatories and help to support the skin, coat, kidneys, joints, and heart.\u00a0Your Doberman may also benefit from joint supplements, especially Dobermans with hip dysplasia. Always talk to your vet before giving your dog supplements. Behavior and Training Tips for Doberman Pinschers Doberman Pinscher Personality and Temperament\u00a0 The Doberman Pinscher temperament is energetic, alert, and loyal. These dogs do well in an active home where they can use their intelligence. Exercise and space for free play are necessities. They can be destructive if left alone for long periods of time without a way to entertain themselves.\u00a0 Photo credit: Adobe/Rita KochmarjovaDoberman Pinscher Behavior\u00a0 Despite their history as a guard dog breed, Dobermans can be fun and loving family dogs, especially with early socialization. Dobermans are usually patient with young children, though their excitable nature means they might accidentally knock very small children over during play. All interactions between kids and dogs, no matter the breed, should be supervised. Dobermans may also have a strong prey drive, which could lead to chasing small animals, including cats. But Dobermans and cats can live together well when introduced properly. Doberman Pinscher Training\u00a0 The Doberman Pinscher is extremely intelligent and thrives in obedience and basic dog training. Dobermans need to have an outlet for all their energy, so providing a consistent training and socialization routine early in life is a great way to encourage good behavior and redirect undesired behaviors. Without positive reinforcement training, Dobermans can become pushy and unmanageable, as well as reactive to novel stimuli (such as strangers, new sounds, and new objects).\u00a0If you are planning on bringing a Doberman Pinscher into your home, be prepared to put in the training and socialization work to help your dog grow into a well-adjusted canine citizen.\u00a0 Fun Activities for Doberman Pinschers\u00a0 Agility Nose work\u00a0 Tracking\u00a0 Obedience training\u00a0 Doberman Pinscher Grooming Guide Though you might immediately picture a tan and black Doberman Pinscher, colors can vary\u2014there are blue Dobermans, red Dobermans, and brown Dobermans. Rust-colored markings are present above the eyes, on the muzzle, on all legs, and below the tail. The breed can also be white in rare cases.\u00a0 No matter the color, Dobermans have a short, smooth coat and are known to be moderate to heavy shedders.\u00a0 Skin Care\u00a0\u00a0 Doberman Pinschers have generally healthy skin that requires minimal upkeep. Monthly or as-needed baths are enough to keep them clean.\u00a0 Talk to your vet if you notice any changes in your Doberman\u2019s skin. Coat Care\u00a0 While the Doberman Pinscher has a short coat, consistent brushing (daily or a couple of times a week) is a good idea to help manage shedding.\u00a0\u00a0 Eye Care Dobermans have no special eye care considerations. Just be sure to give them a quick check when you are brushing or bathing to make sure there are no issues.\u00a0If you notice any redness, discharge, or cloudiness, contact your vet. Ear Care\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s common for Doberman Pinschers to have their ears cropped. However, this practice is controversial and the American Veterinary Medical Association (AMVA) recommends against ear cropping. Uncropped Doberman ears will be folded-over and floppy. Dobermans generally have very healthy ears, but regular ear cleanings are recommended. Use a veterinarian-recommended cleanser. If you notice a lot of debris or redness, notify your vet. This could be a sign of an ear infection.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Considerations for Pet Parents\u00a0 The Doberman Pinscher is an active dog breed. They require routine physical and mental exercise, so they do best in a home with active pet parents. These are also dogs that thrive with a lot of training and socialization, and it is important for helping them grow into well-adjusted adult dogs.\u00a0\u00a0 Dobermans do have a strong prey drive, so homes with small animals are not ideal unless there has been extensive socialization and training. A healthy Doberman should have a physical exam performed by a veterinarian at least once annually. The breed is predisposed to dilated cardiomyopathy, a type of heart disease, so special attention should be paid to symptoms like lethargy, exercise intolerance, coughing, or collapse.\u00a0"}]
