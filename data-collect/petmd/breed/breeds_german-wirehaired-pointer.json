Learn how to care for German Wirehaired Pointer puppies and dogs here.", "articleBody": "German Wirehaired Pointers trace their ancestry to 1800s Germany. Breeders set out to create a dog that would thrive in various environments\u2014from mountains to forests to open fields\u2014and sniff out and point game, whether it be birds or foxes. The result was this medium-sized, bearded German hunting dog. Still used for hunting today, German Wirehaired Pointers have a scruffy double coat that keeps them warm in cold weather and protects them from the elements. The German name for the breed is the Deutsch Drahthaar Pointer. Caring for a German Wirehaired Pointer German Wirehaired Pointers are high-energy dogs that do best with a job and purpose in the family. While they don\u2019t need to be hunters, they do need lots of exercise and mental stimulation to be happy. GWPs (as they\u2019re often called) love to be outside in nature. If you live in the city or in the suburbs, take them on a daily long walk and for longer hikes on the weekends. The German Wirehaired Pointer Club of America (GWPCA) says these sporting dogs also thrive in organized competitions, such as agility, obedience, and hunting trials. As medium-sized dogs, German Wirehaired Pointer puppies grow to be 22\u201326 inches tall and weigh 50\u201370 pounds. German Wirehaired Pointer Health Issues German Wirehaired Pointers are generally healthy dogs that live an average of 14\u201316 years\u2014longer than the typical lifespan of a medium-sized dog. But like all dogs, GWPs can develop certain health conditions. Pet insurance might be a good investment for your German Wirehaired Pointer puppy. Von Willebrand Disease Von Willebrand Disease (vWD) is a genetic blood disorder often seen in German Wirehaired Pointers. The condition prevents a dog\u2019s blood from clotting, thanks to a deficiency in a protein called the von Willebrand factor. This makes bleeding in GWPs dangerous, and you should take your dog to the vet if you notice any unusual bruising, blood in their urine, bleeding from the gums, or nosebleeds. vWD can be detected through a blood test and, though there isn\u2019t a cure, the condition can be managed; dogs with vWD can live long, happy lives. Hypothyroidism Just like in humans, a dog\u2019s thyroid glands help turn food into energy. When a dog\u2019s thyroid becomes underactive, it can lead to obesity, lethargy, and chronic skin and ear infections.\u00a0 Hypothyroidism is diagnosed with a blood test. While there\u2019s no cure, the condition can be managed with lifelong medication. Dogs receiving treatment for hypothyroidism can live long, relatively normal lives. Hip and Elbow Dysplasia Hip dysplasia in dogs is a condition where the hip joint doesn\u2019t develop properly and becomes loose. Similarly, elbow dysplasia is when the elbow joint develops abnormally. Both conditions can lead to pain and arthritis. Hip and elbow dysplasia can be managed with medications, joint supplements, and weight management, though surgery might be required if the case is severe. Talk to your vet about which method is best for your dog. What To Feed a German Wirehaired Pointer German Wirehaired Pointers should eat a food that meets the nutritional standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) and is formulated for their current life stage. Talk to your veterinarian about what food is best for your dog. How To Feed a German Wirehaired Pointer Adult German Wirehaired Pointers should be fed twice a day: at breakfast and dinner. German Wirehaired Pointer puppies should be fed more often: three or four times per day on a regular schedule. How Much Should You Feed a German Wirehaired Pointer? Your dog food packaging will contain feeding guidelines for your dog based on their weight. This is a good place to start, but the best way to know how much to feed your dog is by talking to your vet. Your veterinarian will give you portion guidance based on your dog\u2019s health, weight, and lifestyle. \u00a0 Nutritional Tips for German Wirehaired Pointers As long as your dog eats a well-balanced diet approved by the AAFCO, they won\u2019t need supplements. Your vet may recommend supplements, however, based on the health needs of your dog. Never give a dog supplements before talking with a vet. Behavior and Training Tips for German Wirehaired Pointers German Wirehaired Pointer Personality and Temperament German Wirehaired Pointers are ready for adventure thanks to their robust energy, strength, and intelligence. According to the GWPCA, giving this pup a job is a must\u2014even if it\u2019s just fetching your slippers in the morning. GWPs form a close bond to their family and do well with children who have been taught how to interact with animals. As with every breed, all interactions between dogs and kids should be supervised. However, because this dog has a high prey drive due to their history as hunters, they might not live well with cats or other small animals. German Wirehaired Pointer Behavior GWPs can be anxious, especially if they are away from their pet parent. German Wirehaired Pointers often want to be with their people constantly. Crate training them from an early age can help decrease separation anxiety, but your GWP should never be left alone for long periods. If you don\u2019t like being outside, the GWPCA says a German Wirehaired Pointer won\u2019t be a good fit for you. Make sure you can meet the breed\u2019s need for exercise and stimulation. If they grow bored, German Wirehaired Pointers will bark or dig to occupy themselves. German Wirehaired Pointer Training Because of their smarts and independent spirit in the field, German Wirehaired Pointers need patient training grounded in positive reinforcement. Forming a close bond with your dog is key to training them, according to the breed club.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Fun Activities for German Wirehaired Pointers Hunting Running Hiking Agility Obedience Fetch Nose work Puzzles German Wirehaired Pointer Grooming Guide These German hunting dogs need special care paid to their coat. But otherwise, GWPs are low- maintenance for grooming. \u00a0 Skin Care Because German Wirehaired Pointers love spending so much time outside, keep them up to date on flea and tick prevention, and always check their skin for ticks. Contact your vet if you notice changes in your dog\u2019s skin, such as flakiness or redness. This could be indicative of a bigger problem. Coat Care German Wirehaired Pointers have a double coat that helps keep them warm and protects them from hazards as they hunt. Their fur needs to be stripped (hairs are removed at the root by hand instead of clipped) twice a year. Pet parents can learn to do this on their own, but a specialized groomer can also do it for you.\u00a0 If a GWP\u2019s coat isn\u2019t stripped, it will lose its characteristic wiry texture. This breed rarely needs a bath, but when they do, the National German Wirehaired Pointer Rescue recommends using a shampoo made for wire-coated breeds to preserve the texture.\u00a0 Eye Care A GWP\u2019s eyes should be examined annually to check for any issues. Contact your vet if you notice changes in your dog\u2019s eyes or vision, such as discharge, redness, or cloudiness. Ear Care Regularly (once a month, or more frequently as instructed by your veterinarian) clean your dog\u2019s ears with a veterinary-approved cleaner to stave off ear infections. Talk to your vet if you notice odor or debris coming from your pup\u2019s ears, or if they\u2019re scratching at their ears. \u00a0 Considerations for Pet Parents The perfect home for a German Wirehaired Pointer is filled with people who love the outdoors (preferably hunting) and won\u2019t be away from their dog for long stretches of time. GWPs need constant mental and physical stimulation to keep them\u2014and you\u2014happy. Expect to spend lots of time outdoors with your German Wirehaired Pointer at your side."}]
