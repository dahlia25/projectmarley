History and Background Also known as \u201cthe supreme gundog,\u201d the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is a very popular breed. Although the dog has Dutch roots, most people think it is actually a French breed. It is found in low numbers but it is adored for its excellent qualities as a retriever and pointer. Its faithfulness and versatility make it even more lovable. Mr. Edward Korthals of Holland is often attributed to refining the moderm form of Wirehaired Pointing Griffon. Hence, around the globe many also refer to the breed as the Korthals Griffon. However, the development of this breed can be traced back to the mid-1800s. (The first successful breed was the Cherville Griffon, created by crossing the pointer with the setter.) Korthals began his experimentation in 1874 by crossing 20 dogs belonging to a variety of breeds, including German and French pointers, griffons, spaniels, setters, and water spaniels. According to legend, Korthals carried his new breed around with him while traveling throughout France, thereby popularizing it. He took it to all kinds of places like business meetings, bench shows, fields, and other places. In this manner, the Pointing Griffon became immensely popular in France, and the French willingly adopted it. People loved the dog\u2019s nose and its trait of being a very cautious hunter. In 1887, the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon was considered a standard and stable breed. The following year, in England, show classes for the dog were arranged. It was common for people to assume any properly-furred dog to be Siberian. Thus, many dog-lovers called it the Russian Retriever or Setter. (It is interesting to note that in 1887 in America, the first Wirehaired Pointing Griffon was formally registered as a Russian Setter.) It was inevitable that this lovable breed should become popular. However, its popularity diminished during World War II. Fortunately for pet owners and hunters, the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon regained its demand immediately following the war."}]
