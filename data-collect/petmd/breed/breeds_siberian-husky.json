Born and bred for the snow, they do best with active and experienced pet parents. Learn about caring for Siberian Husky puppies and dogs.", "articleBody": "Siberian Huskies made their U.S. debut in 1908 when they were brought to Nome, Alaska, by Russian fur trader William Goosak. According to the\u00a0Siberian Husky Club of America, Alaskans weren\u2019t impressed with this Siberian breed at first. But over the century that followed, these furry pups became one of the most popular dog breeds. Standing 20\u201323.5 inches and weighing up to 60 pounds, Siberian Huskies are perhaps best known for their talkative personalities and endless energy. They do best in homes with active and experienced pet parents. Caring for a Siberian Husky  Siberian Huskies need space to roam and a lot of mental stimulation. Because of this, they make great pets for active families and children. A Siberian Husky will likely become bored with a sedentary lifestyle. Because Huskies are smart and active, they require consistent training from an early age. Lots of socialization with people and other animals is important for Siberian Husky puppies, but these dogs won\u2019t do well in homes with shared walls or close-by neighbors because they love to talk\u2014loudly, and about everything! They are very vocal dogs and can be expected to howl, sing, and bark. Siberian Husky Health Issues Although Siberian Husky lifespan is fairly long (about 12\u201314 years), they can have a variety of health problems. Cataracts Cataracts, a condition that\u2019s thought to be inherited, is when the eye lenses harden. The rate of advancement varies, but onset can start when a Siberian Husky puppy is as young as 6\u201318 months old. Cataracts do affect vision but can be treated with surgery. If your Husky is experiencing any white opacity on the surface of the eye or vision loss, whether gradual or sudden, visit your veterinarian as soon as possible. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) Progressive retinal atrophy\u00a0is an inherited degenerative disease of the eye\u2019s retina. It\u2019s suspected to be sex-linked in Huskies, more common in males. The earliest clinical sign of PRA is night blindness, which eventually progresses to loss of day vision as well. There is no known treatment. Corneal Dystrophy Corneal dystrophy\u00a0is another condition that\u2019s most likely inherited. This disease is characterized by a white, opaque area that develops in the center of the cornea (the outermost clear surface of the eye). If the lesion grows, it can affect a Husky\u2019s vision. Corneal dystrophy does not usually cause pain or require treatment unless it becomes advanced, resulting in an ulceration of the cornea. In these cases, pet parents are advised to take their Siberian Husky to an eye specialist. Hypothyroidism Hypothyroidism\u00a0is a disease where the thyroid gland underproduces thyroid hormone, which causes an overall slowdown of your pet\u2019s metabolism. This can predispose Siberian Huskies to weight gain, hair loss, or a coarse hair coat. They may also become less active over time. Dogs with chronic skin and ear infections should be tested for low thyroid hormone, as these conditions commonly occur together. Hypothyroidism is easily treated with a daily thyroid supplement. Hip Dysplasia Another common condition in the Siberian Husky is\u00a0hip dysplasia. This is when the hip joint doesn\u2019t develop properly, resulting in a loose joint that leads to\u00a0arthritis. Common symptoms of hip dysplasia include: Limping on one or both hind limbs Difficulty sitting Difficulty standing Struggling when squatting to urinate or defecate Surgery can treat hip dysplasia if it\u2019s caught early enough. What To Feed a Siberian Husky Photo credit: Adobe/cherryandbeesVeterinarians recommend that pet parents feed all dogs a food approved by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO), Siberian Huskies included. Your veterinarian can help you determine what\u2019s best to feed your dog. How To Feed a Siberian Husky Feed your Husky frequent small meals during the day to help keep their metabolism at maximum efficiency and\u00a0prevent obesity. Don\u2019t leave food out all day for them to graze on, as Huskies can easily overindulge. Instead, feed your pup two to three meals per day at set times. Siberian Husky puppies need to eat more frequent meals, about three or four a day. How Much You Should Feed a Siberian Husky As with any breed, always follow the dog food manufacturer\u2019s instructions on how much to feed your pup. The daily total amount should be divided into two or three meals. A consultation with your veterinarian can also help provide additional advice tailored to your pet\u2019s dietary needs. Nutritional Tips for Siberian Huskies Because Huskies enjoy days filled with heart-pounding exercise, feed them a good commercial diet approved by AAFCO. A diet that includes joint supplements such as glucosamine will help keep their joints healthy. Behavior and Training Tips for Siberian Huskies Siberian Husky Personality and Temperament Photo credit: Adobe/TRAVELARIUMSiberian Huskies like to be active and part of the family. They\u2019re smart, outgoing, and tend to be independent thinkers, which can easily lead to behavior problems\u2014such as barking and chewing up your furniture\u2014if not corrected early as a puppy. Siberian Husky Behavior Huskies are friendly dogs that are typically good with kids and other pets, but they are also very smart and strong-willed. They need to have room to run and be active with family members. If they\u2019re cooped up all day or are not given proper attention, your Husky will be a handful. Always supervise dogs and children together. Bored Siberian Huskies have a reputation for being destructive indoors, digging holes outside, and escaping yards to run freely. It\u2019s important to provide your Husky dog with lots of mental stimulation and activity or they will likely look elsewhere for entertainment. Siberian Husky Training Training should start when your Siberian Husky is a puppy to correct unwanted behaviors before they become adults. Huskies\u00a0need to be leash trained\u00a0so they don\u2019t run off to explore on their own. They also need to be trained to avoid excessive barking and howling. Huskies can be independent, which can make them more difficult to train. Training your Husky needs to start as soon as you bring them home and be consistent. Training with treats before mealtimes can motivate your pup to work extra hard and, as with most puppies, training sessions should be short and frequent. Fun Activities for Siberian Huskies Agility Rally Fetch Running Sledding Siberian Husky Grooming Guide Photo credit: JEnnA1506/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty ImagesHuskies have a very thick coat, so you\u2019ll often find hairs all over your floor, furniture, and clothing unless you take steps to keep it from flying. Regular upkeep should prevent your house from being covered in fluff. Skin Care Huskies can be bathed minimally to maintain healthy skin. They typically don\u2019t carry a normal \u201cdoggy\u201d odor, so bathing is needed only when they get a little smelly. Coat Care Huskies have a thick double coat consisting of an undercoat and guard hairs. This undercoat sheds about twice yearly. Brushing them with a rake-style brush will help remove the loose undercoat, reduce shedding, and distribute oils evenly across the skin. Eye Care Because Huskies are prone to many eye diseases, pet parents should take them for an annual eye exam, which can help diagnose disease early. If you notice any vision loss or changes to your pet\u2019s eyes, seek immediate veterinary care. Ear Care Most Huskies don\u2019t have a lot of problems with their ears. But if you notice any debris or gunk there, clean them with a\u00a0high-quality cleanser. If your Husky begins to excessively scratch at their ears, their ears smell, or they appear to be in pain, visit your veterinarian as soon as possible. Considerations for Pet Parents Huskies were bred to be very active, working dogs. Because of this, they do best with active families that can give them at least 40 minutes of exercise every day. Running is a Husky\u2019s favorite activity, and they will thrive with a pet parent who likes to jog daily. Siberian Huskies do best with active families that can give them at least 40 minutes of exercise every day.Without this physical and mental nourishment, Siberian Huskies will likely become destructive and\u00a0loudly\u00a0complain. Huskies do not make good apartment dogs due to their propensity to howl and bark. They require a lot of training starting in puppyhood and do best with experienced dog parents."}]
