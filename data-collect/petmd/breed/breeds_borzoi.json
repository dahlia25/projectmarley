A Borzoi might be just the dog for you.\u00a0 Formerly called the Russian Wolfhound, the Borzoi is known for her regal appearance\u2014including a long snout and silky coat\u2014and gentle, friendly demeanor. After all, Borzoi dogs were bred as companions for Russian nobility, according to the Borzoi Club of America (BCA).\u00a0 Borzoi are a large breed; males stand about 28 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh between 75\u2013105 pounds, while females are a bit smaller at 26 inches tall and 60\u201385 pounds. These dogs were born to hunt, so they like a moderate amount of activity such as a nice, long walk or a sprint around the yard. But be careful around small animals\u2014being sighthounds, Borzoi have an instinct to chase!\u00a0\u00a0 Caring for a Borzoi  Borzoi might look like they\u2019re high-maintenance, but they can be a great choice if you\u2019re seeking a dog that likes low-key companionship. While they\u2019re open to affection and cuddles, including being around children of all ages, Borzoi aren\u2019t big on rough play. They can adjust easily to apartment living and like simple games like tug-of-war. Even a dog this fancy-looking likes to be a goofball!\u00a0 Keep in mind Borzoi were built to run, and the best way to keep them happy and healthy is with long walks and runs in a fenced-in area. Note the emphasis on the fence here: Borzoi will definitely chase squirrels, cats, and other animals that light up their hunting instincts, so going off-leash in public or open places is not advised. But once they\u2019ve gotten all that energy out, they\u2019re happy to curl up with you on the couch. In fact, that\u2019s what they prefer, and if you can\u2019t be at home with your Borzoi most of the time, you might want to consider a more independent dog. When they\u2019re not in hunting mode, Borzoi have a sweet, friendly temperament. They may be shy before making canine friends, and if you want to have other pets, it\u2019s wise to socialize them while your Borzoi is young\u2014they will need to learn that the cat (or hamster) living with them is another family member, not something to hunt! Borzoi Health Issues Like many dog breeds, Borzoi have specific health issues to watch out for. But, in general, they are healthy dogs without too many health quirks. Bloat and Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus The most common health issue for Borzoi is bloat, which can develop into the life-threatening condition gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV). This occurs when the stomach fills with gas, food, and fluid, and then twists, cutting off the blood supply.\u00a0 Borzoi dog parents need to stay alert for the signs of GDV and bloat, including:\u00a0 Restlessness or pacing Stretching in a \u201cpraying mantis\u201d position Distended stomach Dry heaving Retching or vomiting Excessive drooling If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your veterinarian or take your dog to an emergency vet immediately. Sensitivity to Anesthesia All sighthounds, including the Borzoi, are slower to recover from general anesthesia or heavy sedatives than other breeds because of their lean muscle mass and low body-fat percentage, which makes them absorb the drugs more slowly. This doesn\u2019t mean they should avoid anesthesia\u2014rather, veterinarians are more mindful when it comes to anesthesia-sensitive breeds. Talk with your vet before any surgery or procedure that would require general anesthesia or sedation, keeping in mind how your Borzoi might react. Hip and Elbow Dysplasia Russian Borzoi are prone to hip dysplasia and elbow dysplasia. Both conditions occur when the joints form incorrectly and don\u2019t fit together properly, leading to pain and arthritis. Treatment depends on the severity and can fall anywhere between management with pain medication to surgery. To help manage their dysplasia, keep your Borzoi well-exercised and at a healthy weight.\u00a0 Osteochondritis Dissecans (OCD) Though more uncommon, Borzoi can develop osteochondritis dissecans. Known as OCD, it\u2019s an inflammatory disease that occurs when the cartilage in joints separates from the bone. OCD is most common in a dog\u2019s shoulder but also occurs in the elbow, hip, and knee joints. This is mostly seen in large-breed dogs that experience rapid growth as puppies. Talk to your vet if you notice any swelling, limping, or signs of pain in your dog.\u00a0 Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) Borzoi dogs can also develop progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), an inherited eye condition. This is when the rods and cones in a dog\u2019s eye don\u2019t develop properly, leading to complete blindness. There is no treatment for PRA, but with proper care and attention, blind dogs can live long, healthy lives. What To Feed a Borzoi Feed your Borzoi a high-quality dry dog food approved by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). Ask your veterinarian about the best dog food that\u2019s available to buy. Also keep in mind that your Borzoi may have her own opinions about the food you feed her\u2014these independent-minded dogs can be fussy eaters.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How To Feed a Borzoi Borzoi puppies should eat three meals per day on a regular feeding schedule, while an adult dog can eat two meals a day. Be mindful of her age and look for foods designed for your dog\u2019s current life stage (puppy, adult, or senior).\u00a0 Free-feeding Borzoi isn\u2019t the best idea, as these slender dogs can easily become overweight or obese if they are overfed.\u00a0\u00a0 How Much Should You Feed a Borzoi? Borzoi are large dogs, and therefore they need quite a bit of food. However, because they have a lean, delicate frame, there\u2019s no need to feed them an excessive amount. (Too much food may also result in bloat, one of the most common health concerns in Borzoi.)\u00a0 Follow the instructions on your dog food bag to find the recommended portion size for your dog based on her weight. But a Borzoi\u2019s health and lifestyle also play a role in how much she should eat, so speaking with your veterinarian for guidance is best.\u00a0 Nutritional Tips for Borzoi Your Borzoi dog can get all of her nutritional needs met when fed a high-quality, AAFCO-approved diet. But because the breed can be prone to OCD and hip and elbow dysplasia, it could be beneficial to give them joint supplements. Always talk with your vet before giving any supplements to your dog. Behavior and Training Tips for Borzoi Borzoi Personality and Temperament Borzoi dogs have a sweet, friendly personality and temperament, making them great with people of all ages, including children. They don\u2019t like rough play, but they are affectionate, silly, and like some low-key games. They can be shy around new people, so it\u2019s important to socialize your Borzoi puppy early so to be comfortable around strangers and in new situations.\u00a0 Borzoi Behavior\u00a0 Despite their robust size and elegant coat, Borzoi can be sensitive and aloof. They love to be companions to their humans, and they don\u2019t like to be left alone for too long. But this gentle giant does have an instinct to chase anything that moves, so keep your friend on the leash in public.\u00a0\u00a0 Borzoi Training Bred to hunt side-by-side with Russian royalty, Borzoi are obedient and smart dogs. They do best with training that uses positive reinforcement, patience, and repetition.\u00a0 Fun Activities for Borzoi Tug-of-war Fetch Agility\u00a0 Long walks Running (inside enclosed areas!) Lure coursing Scent work Borzoi Grooming Guide The Borzoi is famous for her silky coat, which can be black, brindle, cream, white, or many other colors and patterns. The coat does require frequent maintenance, and pet parents also need to trim their dog\u2019s nails regularly. Skin Care Borzoi dogs don\u2019t typically have sensitive skin, so occasional baths are all that\u2019s needed to keep them healthy.\u00a0Avoid shampoos that are drying and look for one with aloe or oatmeal to help hydrate the skin. Coat Care The Borzoi\u2019s coat needs to be brushed at least two to three times a week with a firm bristle brush, but daily brushing is best. These dogs shed throughout the year and go through a heavy shedding period once a year, according to the BCA. Staying on top of brushing will help keep that silky fur from clinging to your clothes and furniture and prevent tangles in their long locks.\u00a0 Because of their size, bathing these dogs might be tricky. You can keep their fur clean and shiny in between baths with doggy dry shampoo.\u00a0 Eye Care Because Borzoi are prone to developing PRA, pet parents must monitor their dog\u2019s eyes for signs of this condition. If you notice your Borzoi bumping into things, especially at night, take her to the vet for an eye exam.\u00a0 Ear Care During grooming sessions, check your Borzoi\u2019s ears. If you notice any redness, odor, or debris buildup, this could be a sign of an ear infection and should be looked at by a vet.\u00a0 Considerations for Pet Parents Before deciding on a Borzoi puppy, consider your lifestyle. Borzoi are large, but not overly imposing or heavy. They do well in apartments, but benefit from a fenced-in yard where they can run safely.\u00a0 While they are natural athletes and bred to hunt, they are low-key most of the time and can be kept healthy with long walks and the occasional run in an enclosed area. But keep in mind that they will chase anything that moves, so keep them on the leash at all times when on walks or at parks.\u00a0 Borzoi are sweet and friendly, including with children and other dogs, but socializing them early is key to helping them feel comfortable in new situations. The bulk of care will be dedicated to grooming and keeping that silky fur free of tangles.\u00a0"}]
