Bred to hunt birds, small game, and sometimes even wild boar, according to the National Shiba Club of America, today\u2019s Shiba Inu dogs are more likely to be found lying on the couch than tracking prey. This Japanese dog has a pointed muzzle and upright ears, which makes them look almost like a fox. Shibas are small and compact dogs, typically weighing 17\u201323 pounds. They have a double coat, meaning there is a soft undercoat, and a stiff outercoat of guard hairs that can be up to 2 inches long. Their tail is curled, with thick hair, and is held upright over the body. Some common Shiba Inu colors include red, cream, black and tan, and sesame. Caring for a Shiba Inu  The Shiba Inu can be a very friendly dog, but they can also be independent and opinionated\u2014which means they are quite vocal, especially if they are feeling stressed or anxious. Anyone who has a\u00a0Shiba Inu family member can tell you about the \u201cShiba scream.\u201d Shibas are high-energy and very intelligent, so they require lots of mental stimulation and exercise. Their high energy and alertness also mean that they can be predisposed to anxiety and undesirable behaviors\u2014like the Shiba scream\u2014without proper exercise. According to the breed club, Shiba dogs are bold and fiery. This combination, paired with their independent disposition, means they might do best with experienced pet parents who have the patience and consistency to train their Shiba Inu puppy with positive reinforcement. A Shiba Inu\u2019s double coat means they shed quite a bit, and they need regular grooming to maintain a healthy coat. Shiba Inu Health Issues Shiba Inus are, overall, a very healthy breed with an average lifespan of 13\u201316 years. But, as with all dogs, there are a few health issues to be on the lookout for. Allergies They can be predisposed to environmental allergies, which can result in recurring skin and/or ear infections. Regular bathing and ear cleaning can help to control and prevent some skin and ear infections. There are also medications to help control allergies, which can be prescribed by your veterinarian. Patella Luxation Shiba Inu dogs are predisposed to developing\u00a0patella luxation. This a condition in which the kneecaps are unstable and move out of the normal position. Patella luxation can cause pain, limping, and eventually\u00a0arthritis\u00a0in some dogs, while other dogs are asymptomatic. The condition can be diagnosed by a veterinarian with a physical exam. Treatment typically involves anti-inflammatory medications, weight loss, and exercise restrictions. Surgery is needed for severe cases. Dental Disease Like many other small dog breeds, the Shiba Inu is predisposed to developing gingivitis and\u00a0periodontal disease, or gum disease. This is caused by bacteria damaging the gums, bone, and other supporting structures of the teeth.

This can appear as pacing, barking or whining, and destructive behaviors.
