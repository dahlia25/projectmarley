All from the real vets at PetMD.", "articleBody": "By Paula Fitzsimmons A new addition to the AKC hound group, the Grand Basset Griffon Vend\u00e9en is a dog breed that\u2019s steeped in history. Once pack hunters in 16th century France, these medium-size, sturdy scent hounds (also called Grands) now excel at search and rescue. Grands are energetic with an independent streak but are also friendly, outgoing and willing to please, making them a good fit for families, couples or people living alone. Physical Characteristics The Grand Basset Griffon Vend\u00e9en is a rugged and muscular dog breed that weighs between 40 and 55 pounds. Don\u2019t let their sturdiness deceive you, however. They\u2019re also quick and light-footed, says Gina DiNardo, executive secretary of the American Kennel Club, based in New York City. At 18 by 15.5 inches, they\u2019re slightly longer than they are taller, says Corey Benedict, president of the Grand Basset Griffon Vend\u00e9en Club of America. A look at their history provides insight into why they\u2019re built this way. \u201cThey were bred to endure in the rough terrain in Vend\u00e9e, France. They have to have the correct balance because form follows function,\u201d he says. The Grand\u2019s trademark features are straight legs, a deep chest, a moderately-long muzzle and neck, long ears and a long tail, says DiNardo. \u201cThis breed also has a noble head with a mustache and beard and protective, long eyebrows,\u201d she adds. Their ears should lie like a corkscrew, says Benedict. \u201cYou should see the corkscrew fold in their ear when relaxed.\u201d These pups have shaggy but wire-textured coats. A rough coat may have helped protect them while running through brambly fields. They present in a variety of color combinations, including black and tan, white and tan, white and orange, and tri-colored. Personality and Temperament Grands are a good fit for households of any size. Those who know this breed best mention their willingness to please their humans and their ability to get along well with other dogs. \u201cThey\u2019re also outgoing, fun-loving, warm and friendly,\u201d says DiNardo. Expect an energetic, fast-moving pup with lots of stamina. The Grand is a scent hound that likes to chase smaller animals\u2014they used to successfully hunt rabbits and hares in ancient France. Experts says this dog breed can be stubborn and independent, so you need to be prepared to lead. \u201cIf you\u2019re not a strong leader, this probably isn\u2019t a breed for you. It\u2019s also not a dog breed suitable for a first-time pet owner,\u201d Benedict says. Care The Grand Bassett Griffon Vend\u00e9en isn\u2019t the type of dog that will be content to curl up on the sofa all day. In fact, \u201cThey require vigorous daily exercise and enjoy the company of other dogs and people during playtime,\u201d says DiNardo. Having an enclosed backyard where your pup can play and release energy is a definite plus. While they can be trained for obedience and agility work, they don\u2019t generally excel in this area, says Benedict. With their rough coats, Grands may not require the same level of maintenance as dogs with longer and bushier coats, but DiNardo says they still need to be brushed weekly to remain mat-free. He adds that \u201can occasional bath will keep him looking clean.\u201d They also need to be stripped at least three times a year, says Benedict. Hand stripping is the process of pulling out old hairs on wire-coated dog breeds to make room for new ones. \u00a0 Health Overall, the Grand Basset Griffon Vend\u00e9en is a healthy dog breed with few health problems, but Benedict says that hip dysplasia and eye disorders can occur. Pet parents, of course, play an essential role in a pup\u2019s health by providing optimal nutrition and care, but they also need to choose a Grand breeder wisely. \u201cResponsible breeders work hard to better their breed by doing the recommended health testing, including hip, eye, heart, thyroid and patella evaluations,\u201d says DiNardo. With optimal upbringing and lifetime care, the Grand Basset Griffon Vend\u00e9en can live between 12 and 15 years old, experts say. History and Background The Grand Basset Griffon Vend\u00e9en\u2019s lineage can be traced back to 16th century Vend\u00e9e, a western region of France noted for its beaches, winding rivers and rough, brambly terrain. In their native country of France, Grands were efficient pack hunters, chasing mostly after rabbits and hare. King Louis XII kept Grands, as well as Petit Basset Griffon Vend\u00e9ens, Grand Griffon Vend\u00e9ens and Briquet Griffon Vend\u00e9ens as one litter. They were considered one breed and referred to as the King\u2019s White Hounds, says Benedict. The first pups entered the US through Holland in 1990, but the AKC didn\u2019t officially recognize them as a new dog breed in their hound group until January of 2018, says DiNardo."}]
