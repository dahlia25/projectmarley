The word &quot;bouvier&quot; means ox-herd or cowherd in French. They are popular today as show dogs and herders. They received their name from southwest Flanders where they were used by farmers for managing cattle in the farmlands. This breed was also used by farmers on the plains of northern France. The Bouvier des Flandres was also known as koe bond (cow dog) or Vuilbaard (dirty beard). They existed in a variety of colors, types, and sizes. Besides managing cattle, they had to work as a draft dog and a farm dog as well. It is assumed that this breed originated from the Sheepdog, Mastiff, and certain spaniels to some extent. The first standard that was drawn up in 1912 created a great interest in the breed. A large number of the Bouvier des Flandres dogs were, however, lost during the First World War, when they served as ambulance and messenger dogs. A dog named Ch. Nic de Sottegem survived the war and proved to have great quality. All the modern Bouviers are descendants of this dog. It was in 1922 that a revised standard led to the production of a more homogeneous breed. They earned huge popularity as show dogs in the 1930s, when they first entered the United States."}]
