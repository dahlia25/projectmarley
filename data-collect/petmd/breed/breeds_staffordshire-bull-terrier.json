They are loyal to their family and love to be near the ones they love. Learn all about caring for Staffy dogs and puppies.", "articleBody": "The Staffordshire Bull Terrier\u2019s affinity for their human companions is legendary\u2014even the small ones, hence the breed\u2019s nickname, \u201cthe nanny dog.\u201d The breed, known for its loyalty, is named after its U.K. origins and is often considered a descendant of 19th-century Bull Terriers (a cross between Old Bulldogs and British Terriers), according to the Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club of America (SBTCA). This medium-size breed\u2014called Staffies for short\u2014can reach up to 16 inches tall and weigh 24\u201338 pounds. They\u2019re often stocky and muscular (some might say buff!) and are described as playful and protective. Caring for a Staffordshire Bull Terrier Staffordshire Bull Terriers love their people and their comforts at home, but they\u2019re also active, agile, and curious. Tug-of-war is a go-to game, and you can\u2019t go wrong with a long, leash-led walk. Staffies have a short, glossy coat that loses dirt easily and dries quickly, so minimal grooming is required. Like any breed, each Staffy dog has their own personality. The SBTCA describes them as a physically and mentally tenacious breed, but adds that many Staffies live peacefully with other animals. It comes down to proper socialization, training, and supervision. Overall, they are an intelligent and loving breed\u2014some are even\u00a0lap dogs\u2014and will dedicate themselves to you and your home. Staffordshire Bull Terrier Health Issues  The average Staffordshire Bull Terrier lifespan is 12\u201314 years, and the breed is statistically a healthy dog. But it\u2019s important for pet parents to know that Staffies are very averse to heat. Limit outdoor exercise in warm weather, and make sure they have plenty of shade and water. And, like any breed, Staffordshire Bull Terriers can be susceptible to health conditions, including: Elbow and Hip Dysplasia\u00a0 Elbow dysplasia refers to abnormalities in a dog\u2019s elbow where the joint doesn\u2019t develop properly. Hip dysplasia is a similar condition, where the hip joint doesn\u2019t fit together properly and becomes loose. If left untreated, both can lead to arthritis. Ask your vet for a screening if you notice symptoms like lameness or limping, an abnormal gait, or a swollen joint. Treatment can include joint supplements, weight management, and surgery in severe cases. Luxating Patella Patellar luxation refers to the knee joint moving out of its proper position. This often manifests as a limp and bunny-hopping gait. Like with hip and elbow dysplasia, treatment usually involves supplements and weight management, but surgery can be required in severe cases.\u00a0 Juvenile Hereditary Cataracts (JHC) JHC causes clouding in a Staffy\u2019s eye lens. And while many dogs develop cataracts as they age, JHC causes cataracts in young dogs. Dogs with JHC can develop cataracts during their first year of life and become blind by the time they\u2019re 2\u20133 years old.\u00a0 Corrective surgery is a treatment option, and the SBTCA recommends breeders genetically test for this ailment.\u00a0 L-2-Hydroxyglutaric Aciduria L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (or L-2-HGA) is a genetic condition that affects a dog\u2019s metabolism. It can lead to neurologic issues such as brain damage. Symptoms, according to the SBTCA, include:\u00a0 Epileptic seizures Wobbly gait Behavioral changes Tremors Muscle stiffness as a result of exercise or excitement There is currently no cure, but responsible Staffy breeders will screen their dogs for this condition. Degenerative Myelopathy (DM) DM is the slow-onset destruction of the spinal cord. According to Cornell University, DM in dogs acts similarly to Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, or ALS, in humans. A dog with degenerative myelopathy will start showing signs when they\u2019re middle-aged and become weaker over time. Eventually, DM causes paralysis. Currently, there are no effective treatments for DM aside from palliative care, and diet and exercise. What To Feed a Staffordshire Bull Terrier  One of the best ways to keep dogs healthy is to feed them the right amount of high-quality dog food. Pet parents should choose a food that\u2019s approved by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) for your dog\u2019s current life stage. Consult your vet on the best feeding schedule, especially for a Staffy puppy, and the best ways to balance meeting nutritional needs while avoiding overfeeding.\u00a0 How To Feed a Staffordshire Bull Terrier Staffy puppies should be fed three or four times a day on a consistent schedule. Adult Staffies can be fed twice a day. If you have concerns about feeding your Staffordshire Bull Terrier, contact your vet.\u00a0 How Much Should You Feed a Staffordshire Bull Terrier? The amount of food your Staffy needs varies by dog. Factors influencing their portions include your dog\u2019s lifestyle, age, weight, and activity level. Dog food bags will often have a feeding guide that typically recommends a total amount of food that should be given to your dog over a 24-hour period, but always talk to your veterinarian for the best guidance.\u00a0 Nutritional Tips for Staffordshire Bull Terriers When it comes to training, Staffies respond well to positive reinforcement (which often means treats!). That said, some dogs can be prone to gaining weight, so avoid giving your Staffy too many goodies. Consider using healthy treats, such as carrots, apples, or blueberries to keep your pup fit and healthy. You should be able to feel (but not see) your Staffy\u2019s ribs without having to press too hard. Behavior and Training Tips for Staffordshire Bull Terriers  Staffordshire Bull Terrier Personality and Temperament Staffies are playful and affectionate, so pet parents can expect a breed that craves their love and attention. They are known for their gentle nature toward children\u2014so much, in fact, that they\u2019ve earned the nickname \u201cthe nanny dog.\u201d\u00a0Puppy Staffies brought up with cats and other dogs generally do well with them, according to the SBTCA. If you already have a dog and are bringing an older Staffy into your home, introduce the dogs away from the house in a neutral area.\u00a0 Staffordshire Bull Terrier Behavior In general, Staffies are not persistent barkers, though the SBTCA notes they might bark or \u201ctalk\u201d while playing or to alert you of a visitor. Bouts of exercise and long walks are important to meet their high energy levels, but they\u2019re also very content napping on your couch. Staffordshire Bull Terrier Training Staffies are also known for their smarts, and they respond best to a positive, creative training approach. The SBTCA warns that the breed can be stubborn and exuberant, so persistence and patience when training is also important.\u00a0 Fun Activities for Staffordshire Bull Terriers Agility Hiking/long walks Tug-of-war Scent work Lure coursing Staffordshire Bull Terrier Grooming Guide  Staffordshire Bull Terriers don\u2019t need a ton of grooming. Their coats are smooth, short, and easy to clean if needed.\u00a0 Skin Care While no special skin care is required for Staffies, it doesn\u2019t hurt to bathe them after a particularly messy playdate outside. But if your Staffy rolls around in the grass, a thorough brushing might be all that\u2019s needed. Coat Care\u00a0 Though Staffies have a low-maintenance coat, they benefit from an occasional brushing and bath. But their coat does make Staffies susceptible to fleas and ticks, so ask your vet about flea and tick prevention, and give them a good brushing with a flea comb in the summer months.\u00a0 Eye Care Staffordshire Bull Terriers typically don\u2019t require special eye care, but pet parents should watch for signs of cataracts, especially if their dog hasn\u2019t been tested for JHC.\u00a0 Ear Care Staffordshire Bull Terriers don\u2019t require special ear care. Your vet can help determine if\u2014and how often\u2014you should clean your dog\u2019s ears.\u00a0 Considerations for Pet Parents If you plan to bring home a Staffy puppy, know that you\u2019re getting a breed that looks tough on the outside but is an affectionate, loving cuddler on the inside. Their low-maintenance grooming and nutritional needs make them ideal for most pet owners, but they\u2019ll do best in a home with pet parents who are active, attentive, and patient."}]
