Also known as the Brittany Spaniel or Brittany Dog, this sporty, sweet, and smart pup is perfect for a family with children or an energetic single person in search of a workout partner.\u00a0 The Brittany was originally bred as a hunting dog in France\u2019s Brittany province in the 1800s, according to the American Brittany Club. Despite being a little more compact (standing 17\u201320 inches tall and weighing 30\u201340 pounds), the French Brittany is still very athletic and has energy to spare. But with their soft coat and sensitive nature, the pups make great cuddlers, too. Caring for a Brittany If you are adopting a Brittany, plan on introducing them to all your friends and family. Early socialization in Brittany puppies is a must\u2014and when done correctly, they make peaceful and friendly family dogs. Just don\u2019t skip playtime. The Brittany was bred to be a hunting dog, so they are athletic dogs with a lot of energy. Plan to spend your days playing fetch, running, hiking, agility training, or romping around in the backyard when this dog is part of your family. But while they require lots of mental stimulation and physical exercise, Brittany dogs are low-maintenance when it comes to grooming their orange-and-white coat. Brittany Health Issues Brittany dogs are generally a very healthy breed without many notable health issues. But like every breed, there are a few health conditions to which the Brittany can be prone. Hip Dysplasia Hip dysplasia is one of the few health issues some\u00a0Brittany dogs may develop. This genetic condition affects the stability of the hip joint, occurring when the joint doesn\u2019t fit together properly. This leads to a loose joint that, if left untreated, eventually causes osteoarthritis in dogs. Because the Brittany is an active breed, watch for signs of weakness in their back legs, or an aversion to playtime and exercise. Talk to your vet if you have concerns. Epilepsy Another genetic condition that often affects the Brittany is epilepsy, a disorder of the brain that results in seizures, but with an unknown cause. In dogs, an epileptic seizure can look like unusual behavior, such as incessant chewing, sniffing, head shaking, hiding, running erratically, or losing their balance. But it can also look like a standard seizure, where they fall over, convulse, and urinate and/or defecate. If your dog has a seizure that lasts longer than two minutes, see a vet right away. While upsetting to witness, these episodes are not fatal, and the condition can be treated with lifelong medication and monitoring. Brittany dogs, and other dogs with epilepsy, can still live a full, happy life. Hypothyroidism Hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid is slow to produce certain hormones. If your Brittany seems lethargic, is gaining weight, has chronic skin and ear infections, and isn\u2019t their usual boisterous self, have your vet check their thyroid levels. Other symptoms include a dry, coarse coat that may or may not be falling out; droopy eyelids; and heat-seeking behavior. This is another non-fatal condition that can be treated with daily medication and will not affect your Brittany Spaniel\u2019s life span. Cataracts Brittany Spaniels are prone to cataracts, which causes the eye lenses to become cloudy and leads to vision loss. If you notice your dog\u2019s eyes have a somewhat milky appearance and they\u2019re bumping into things, it\u2019s time for an eye exam. Cataracts can be removed with surgery. What To Feed a Brittany Brittany dogs do best on a high-protein diet approved by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). Go-to brands include Purina\u00ae, Royal Canin\u00ae, and Hill\u2019s Science Diet.\u00a0 How To Feed a Brittany Feed your Brittany twice a day\u2014once in the morning and once at night. Because these sporty, active dogs can work up an appetite, feeding them on a schedule (and not free-feeding) is best so they don\u2019t gain too much weight. Brittany Spaniel puppies need to eat even more frequently, about three or four times per day. How Much Should You Feed a Brittany? The amount of food needed depends on your Brittany\u2019s age, weight, and activity level. Consult your vet if you\u2019re unsure about the best amount to feed your dog. Nutritional Tips for Brittanys As long as your Brittany is eating a high-quality dog food, they won\u2019t need supplements unless your veterinarian recommends them. Behavior and Training Tips for Brittanys Brittany Personality and Temperament As a breed, the Brittany is one of the sweetest and most friendly dogs out there, and one way to assure this is to socialize your Brittany early. From an early age, let your Brittany puppy interact with new people, children, and other animals. Not only will this encourage confidence in your Brittany, but it will help them be less timid, as this dog can be quite sensitive. Their sensitive soul means Brittany dogs don\u2019t do well when left alone for long periods, as they can be prone to separation anxiety. Brittany Behavior Eager-to-please, energetic Brittany Spaniels need to stay busy. If they become bored, they\u2019ll find ways to entertain themselves, like chewing your couch cushions or barking loudly. The Brittany was bred to hunt birds, so they are hardwired with a high prey drive. This means they will chase birds (and possibly other smaller animals) whenever they\u2019re outside. To keep your Brittany safe, keep them within a fenced space or on a leash whenever they\u2019re outdoors. Brittany Training Smart, gentle, positive reinforcement training is the way to go with a Brittany. Though they\u2019re eager to please the people they love and can pick up cues quickly, don\u2019t make training sessions too long or your pup will get frustrated and bored. Keep training short, frequent, and fun\u2014and always reward your Brittany with treats and praise. Fun Activities for Brittanys Fetch Long walks Running Hunting Hiking Brittany Grooming Guide While lots of attention needs to go into keeping a Brittany active and mentally stimulated, you don\u2019t have to worry that much about grooming their orange-and-white fur. Skin Care Brittany dogs are not too prone to skin problems, but always check them for ticks, burrs, or cuts if you take your pup on a hike or hunting trip. Because they like to spend so much time running around outside, your Brittany will need an occasional bath whenever they get dirty or smelly. Coat Care Regular brushing (about once a week) with a soft brush is all the typical Brittany needs to stay healthy and well-groomed. Their wavy fur does shed, especially in the spring and fall, so you might need to brush them more often during these seasons to keep up with flying fur. Eye Care Brittanys have bright, clear eyes that don\u2019t require a lot of attention as far as grooming goes. But because the breed is prone to some eye conditions, check with your vet if you notice changes, such as cloudiness or discharge. Ear Care Brittanys have floppy ears, which means it\u2019s easy for debris and moisture to become trapped in the canals. This makes them susceptible to ear infections. To prevent this, clean your Brittany\u2019s ears after you bathe them (or after they splash around in water) with a dog-friendly ear cleaner. Considerations for Pet Parents While not a good dog for couch potatoes, the Brittany can be the perfect, medium-size sporting dog for an active family with children and other pets. They need lots of care when it comes to staying busy and active, but these healthy dogs are relatively low-maintenance in almost every other aspect. If you\u2019re a hunter, runner, or avid hiker, the Brittany is a go-to breed."}]
