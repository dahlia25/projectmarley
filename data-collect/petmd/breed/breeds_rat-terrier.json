Between this, their intelligence, and their energy levels, they\u2019re typically best suited to experienced pet parents. Bred to hunt rats, as their name suggests, Rat Terriers are bright and nimble. While they can still certainly excel in the hunt, this is a very family-oriented dog that wants to join in with whatever his people happen to be doing. This breed comes in two compact sizes: a miniature Rat Terrier dog that stands 10\u201313 inches tall, and the standard size that\u2019s 13\u201318 inches tall. The Rat Terrier lifespan is generally 12\u201318 years.\u00a0 Caring for a Rat Terrier  \u201cRat Terriers are, in general, the \u2018jack-of-all-trades\u2019 of the terrier world,\u201d says Tracey Kallas, an AKC judge, vice president and judges education coordinator for the Rat Terrier Club of America and owner of K2 Rat Terriers. She\u2019s been breeding, training, showing, and loving the breed for 30 years. Rat Terriers are incredible hunters, containing the intelligence and sense of humor that you\u2019d expect in a terrier. They also have a strong desire to be with their people; this is not a breed that enjoys being left alone for long periods. Athletic and playful, Rat Terriers are feisty, funny dogs that need an appropriate outlet for their energy. If they\u2019re restless or bored, they may use their bright mind to come up with a way to entertain themselves that you\u2019re unlikely to appreciate. Grooming, however, is generally a cinch thanks to their slick, tight coat\u2014but be aware that they do still shed. As much as they love their family, this breed was bred to hunt vermin\u2014and their natural prey drive reflects that, so early (and consistent!) socialization and training is a must. \u201cRatties,\u201d as they\u2019re often called, typically get along well with other pets (including cats!) if they\u2019re raised with them. That said, they can view pocket pets like hamsters as snacks rather than siblings. Rat Terrier Health Issues Rat Terriers that have their nutritional, environmental, and social needs met and come from responsible breeders tend to be healthy dogs. However, there are a few potential health issues for which the national breed club recommends testing. Hip Dysplasia Hip dysplasia occurs when the hip joint has developed abnormally and creates a loose joint. Dogs with this condition generally show signs of discomfort including reduced mobility, less interest in activity, or simply moving stiffly. Talk to your vet about whether joint supplements, anti-inflammatory medications, or even surgery may help your pup. Patellar Luxation This condition, where the kneecap (or patella) shifts out of place, is common in Rat Terriers and other small dog breeds. Dogs with patellar luxation might \u201cskip\u201d or \u201cbunny hop,\u201d lifting a hind leg as they walk. Treatment might not be necessary in mild cases, but joint supplements might be helpful with this condition. Surgery might be recommended if the luxation is severe. Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes Disease Dogs with Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease\u00a0experience a disintegration of their hip joint at the head of their femur bone. This can lead to pain and osteoarthritis. Your vet will diagnose the condition with X-rays, and treatment is often done with surgery. Dogs usually recover very easily from this surgery and go on to live long, pain-free lives. Primary Lens Luxationlens luxation may have painful, reddened eyes; iris or lens trembling; or other abnormalities that your veterinarian will be able to observe. This condition can lead to glaucoma and, if left untreated, total blindness. Cardiac Disease Rat Terriers, especially as they age, can develop heart disease. They may have a heart murmur that your vet will detect, but other symptoms may include coughing, weight loss, fatigue, or fainting from excitement or exercise. It\u2019s also possible for a dog to have heart issues with no symptoms. Your veterinarian will advise you on whether changes to diet and exercise are in order, and in some cases your Rat Terrier might need lifelong medications. What To Feed a Rat Terrier A balanced diet of high-quality dog food is best for a Rat Terrier. Opt for commercially available food approved by the\u00a0Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO)\u00a0to make sure your food of choice provides proper nutrition and meets all necessary regulations. A dog food designed for small dog breeds would be appropriate, and\u2014because Rat Terriers can be prone to skin allergies from various causes\u2014Kallas says she looks for kibble with a fish-based protein (otherwise, she supplements with fish oil). How To Feed a Rat Terrier\u00a0 Rat Terriers tend to be good eaters, so feed them a measured amount of a food appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult, or senior) twice a day. Free-feeding, or leaving food out all the time, is not recommended; this can easily cause them to become overweight or obese. How Much Should You Feed a Rat Terrier?\u00a0 Although they\u2019re small and active, Rat Terriers are prone to obesity, says Iram Sharma, DVM and veterinary writer. This is particularly concerning due to their potential for joint and cardiac issues. Always make sure you\u2019re feeding your Rat Terrier the proper amount. Your AAFCO-approved dog food will have portion recommendations on the bag, and your vet can help with any feeding questions. Nutritional Tips for Rat Terriers\u00a0 Because Rat Terriers are prone to joint issues, Sharma recommends pet parents talk to their vet about incorporating joint-friendly supplements that contain chondroitin and glucosamine into their dog\u2019s diet. Behavior and Training Tips for Rat Terriers Rat Terrier Personality and Temperament \u00a0 Rat Terriers are persistent and tenacious when it comes to problem-solving and getting a job done. Kallas loves this about the breed, but she admits it can also be downright difficult for inexperienced dog parents who aren\u2019t prepared to set (and stick to!) firm and consistent rules. Ratties need plenty of physical and mental stimulation; remember, these are bright pups with a curious nature, so it\u2019s on you to keep them out of trouble.\u00a0 If a Rat Terrier is introduced to new people (including children), other dogs, and cats early on, they\u2019ll likely get along with everyone. As with any dog, supervision with children is recommended. \u201cRat Terriers can be very affectionate and good with children; however, not all dogs like kids, just like not all humans like kids,\u201d Kallas says. She strongly recommends working closely with a reputable Rat Terrier breeder to find a puppy that\u2019s a good fit for your situation.\u00a0 Rat Terrier Behavior\u00a0 As members of the terrier group, Rat Terriers can have a propensity to dig, particularly if they aren\u2019t receiving enough attention. Paired with their insatiable curiosity and athletic nature, this can make them talented escape artists, so this is not a dog you should leave alone in your backyard. They\u2019re not generally nuisance barkers but, again, if they\u2019re feeling bored or lonely, they may let you know. Regular exercise is non-negotiable, but they don\u2019t need to be kept moving at all times. The important thing is that your Rat Terrier feels engaged in what their family is doing. \u201cThey are smart enough and social enough to want to be a part of everything, to want to know and understand what is going on around them, and to try to be part of the fun,\u201d Kallas says.\u00a0 Rat Terrier Training \u00a0 Socializing your Rat Terrier puppy (in addition to providing them with appropriate mental and physical stimulation) is essential. And while that should begin with your breeder, that\u2019s only the start. \u201c[Breeders] do their job for the first eight weeks, and it\u2019s your job to work on that for at least the next year. And it is a job,\u201d Kallas says. \u201cThe best thing you can do for your new family member is get them out into the world and experience it with them.\u201d Rat Terriers do best with positive reinforcement, patience, and clear boundaries\u2014though, Kallas says, they will test those boundaries. Training sessions should be kept short, fun, and full of rewards for good behavior. Introducing them to crate training early on is wise, because it will keep them (and anything they can get their teeth on) safe if you need to leave them alone for a bit. Fun Activities for Rat Terriers\u00a0 Agility\u00a0 Obedience training Flyball Scent work/tracking Swimming Jogging Hiking Playing with toys Cuddling on the couch Being with their people Rat Terrier Grooming Guide With their short, dense coat, Rat Terriers are low maintenance in the grooming department. But it should be noted that they shed mildly throughout the year, with a heavier seasonal shed in the spring and fall.\u00a0 Pet parents need to keep up with weekly nail trims, and Kallas recommends annual dental cleanings. \u201cThese are tough little dogs who use their mouths to interact with the world,\u201d she says, \u201cso keeping their teeth healthy is important for their happiness.\u201d Skin Care\u00a0 \u201cRat Terriers\u2019 skin is quite sensitive, especially around the belly region,\u201d Sharma says. \u201cThey are prone to chronic allergies and scratching, which often results in secondary bacterial infections.\u201d If you notice your Rattie scratching or licking more than usual or any red bumps or hair loss, talk to your veterinarian right away to reduce the risk of a more serious infection. Coat Care\u00a0 The Rat Terrier\u2019s coat doesn\u2019t require too much to stay smooth and shiny. A quick brushing every week or so will help remove dead hairs and reduce shedding. Ratties might need a bath now and then, Kallas says, but that\u2019s mostly only if they begin to smell. But you should not bathe them more frequently than once a month or so, she adds, as this will strip them of the natural oils that keep their skin healthy.\u00a0 Eye Care\u00a0 Because Rat Terriers are prone to certain eye issues, take a good look at them when you sit down for a grooming session so you can note any changes. Another tip: When bathing your Rat Terrier, Sharma says to take care to prevent shampoo and water from getting into their eyes. \u201cRat Terriers don\u2019t have long fur around their eyes and ears like some breeds do, which makes them more susceptible to water entering and causing irritation.\u201d Ear Care\u00a0 Aside from doing your best to keep water out of your Rat Terrier\u2019s ears, there\u2019s not much in the way of special ear care required. However, because they can be more prone to environmental allergies than some breeds, keep an eye out for any itching of the ears, which could lead to infection. Considerations for Pet Parents\u00a0 Before you add a Rat Terrier to your family, make sure you\u2019re prepared to meet their needs. They require firm boundaries, regular exercise, and lots of love and attention from their family to feel safe, secure, and happy. \u201cBecause they\u2019re very malleable and smart, they can adapt to most situations and make a really nice addition to your family, no matter what your family likes to do,\u201d Kallas says. However, if you\u2019re a bit of a pushover for puppy-dog eyes, prefer to let your pooch set the rules, can\u2019t see the humor in your dog trying to outsmart you, or don\u2019t have a lifestyle you can easily incorporate your dog into (now and for the next 15 years), this is not the right breed for you.\u00a0"}]
