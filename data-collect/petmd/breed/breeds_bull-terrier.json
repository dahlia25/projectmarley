They need lots of exercise and even more attention from their pet parents. Learn more about caring for Bull Terriers.", "articleBody": "The following may contain Chewy links. PetMD is operated by Chewy. \u00a0 While the Bull Terrier isn\u2019t among the most popular dog breeds in the United States, they\u2019re certainly one of the most recognizable thanks to their egg-shaped heads, triangular eyes, and muscular bodies. (Not to mention that the Bull Terrier has frequently been in the public eye as the Target dog). The Bull Terrier\u2019s athletic build generally reaches a height of 21-22 inches, and they weigh in at around 50-70 pounds.\u202f\u00a0\u202f\u00a0 This stocky dog breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1885, and despite their unfortunate beginnings in bull-baiting, Bull Terriers are a sweet and lovable breed. For those prepared to provide them with the attention and training they need, Bull Terriers make wonderful family dogs. Caring for a Bull Terrier  The Bull Terrier is playful, athletic, and generally low-maintenance\u2014as long as they get plenty of interaction with people. \u201cThey\u2019re easy to engage in exercise and are happy to greet each new day,\u201d says Kim Bebb, president of the Bull Terrier Club of America. \u201cThey thrive on being one of the family.\u201d\u202f\u00a0 That being said, Bull Terriers are still a member of the terrier group, and with that comes a certain amount of energy and independent thinking. So it\u2019s important to provide this breed with physical and mental stimulation as well as consistent positive reinforcement training. Early socialization and obedience training will go a long way toward ensuring your Bull Terrier puppies grow into well-mannered family members.\u00a0 Bull Terrier Health Issues  Bull Terriers typically have a lifespan of 12-13 years and, according to the Bull Terrier Club of America, there are a few health issues that pet parents should note.\u00a0 Official health concerns aside, it\u2019s important to note that this breed tends to eat and chew on anything that\u2019s around\u2014which can easily lead to an intestinal blockage. \u201cMany Bull Terriers have had at least one \u2018zipper surgery\u2019 in their lifetime,\u201d Bebb says, referring to the incision veterinarians make near a blockage site to retrieve the object, leaving behind a scar that looks like a zipper. For that reason, pet insurance may not be a bad idea with this breed.\u00a0 Patellar Luxation\u00a0 Patellar luxation is a condition in which the kneecap (or patella) shifts out of place. The most common and noticeable symptom is when a dog suddenly lifts one hind leg, sometimes yelping. This is often called a \u201cskip\u201d or \u201chop\u201d and it generally comes and goes.\u202f\u00a0 Patellar luxation is usually diagnosed with a physical exam where a veterinarian manipulates the back limbs with one of their hands over the knee to feel the patella luxating, says Dr. Yui Shapard, BVM&amp;S, Educational Director for the Association of Asian Veterinary Medical Professionals. Based on that exam, they\u2019ll grade it from mild to severe.\u202f\u00a0 \u201cTreatment is based on how this is affecting the patient, and in many mild cases no treatment is required,\u201d Dr. Shapard says. \u201cIn severe cases, a surgical correction may be required\u2014especially if it is affecting the patient\u2019s quality of life.\u201d\u202f\u00a0 Another common recommendation is an omega-3 supplement for mild cases, which she says can provide anti-inflammatory relief that can be given long-term. Glucosamine supplements in addition to MSM are great to help promote joint health and have all natural anti-inflammatory properties as well. They\u2019re recommended to any dog that has joint issues such as luxating patella.\u00a0\u00a0 Mitral Valve Dysplasia\u00a0 Mitral valve dysplasia is a congenital defect of one or more components of the mitral valve complex that leads to congestive heart failure. It\u2019s often indicated by a heart murmur, which can be identified by a veterinarian through a cardiac exam.\u202f\u00a0 Dogs with this heart valve developmental malformation have valves that don\u2019t close properly, become narrow, and allow a backflow of blood from the left ventricle to the left atrium, which in turn affects the high-oxygen blood flowing from lungs to heart. Symptoms occur directly from the defect itself or secondary to congestive heart failure, and they include coughing, tiring easily, bluish or gray gums, increased respiratory rate, and collapse or fainting. Your vet may diagnose based on these clinical signs, your dog\u2019s lineage, or other tests including bloodwork, blood pressure, radiographs, or even echocardiography or electrocardiogram.\u202f\u00a0\u202f\u00a0 Although there is no cure, there are treatment options for managing symptoms, including hospitalization with oxygen therapy, diuretic therapy, oral medications, exercise restriction, and possible sodium reduction in the dog\u2019s diet.\u00a0\u00a0 Hereditary Nephritis\u00a0 One of the more serious causes of kidney failure in dogs, hereditary nephritis is often seen in Bull Terriers, so make sure to ask your breeder for proof of testing for kidney issues before committing to a Bull Terrier puppy.\u202f\u00a0\u202f\u00a0 Symptoms of kidney failure include poor appetite and increased thirst and urination. Your veterinarian will conduct a urinalysis (ideally on a urine sample taken first thing in the morning, when the sample is most concentrated) to see whether the kidney is filtering what should be filtered and retaining that which needs to be retained, says Dr. Shapard. Blood samples may also be taken to aid in diagnosis.\u00a0\u202f\u00a0 Unfortunately, by the time a diagnosis of kidney failure is made, patients are often sick enough that response to treatment is too slow to be effective. In some cases, euthanasia may be the most humane option.\u00a0 Partial or Total Deafness\u00a0 Certain dog breeds with the merle, piebald, or extreme white piebald genes (like the Bull Terrier) are more likely to be born with partial or total deafness. \u201cClinical signs of deafness are a challenge to detect, especially when they are born deaf, as they can still go about their daily lives,\u201d Dr. Shapard says. \u201c[Pet parents] may notice that it is hard to rouse them when asleep or they may notice that their dog appears to have difficulty locating the origin of a sound, and deaf puppies may be more vocal and play more aggressively.\u201d\u202f The brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) test is recognized as the best hearing test available for hereditary deafness in dogs and can be used to screen puppies as young as 6-8 weeks, says Dr. Shapard. But your veterinarian may also simply make a loud noise (like a finger snap) out of your dog\u2019s sight and near their ear to diagnose a hearing deficit.\u00a0 \u201cThere are no treatments for this, and those that have been diagnosed as deaf should not be bred as this will carry down its genetic line,\u201d says Dr. Shapard. However, keep in mind that a deaf dog can live a full and happy life without hearing, as long as you\u2019re willing to adjust your training methods to be visual rather than auditory.\u00a0 What To Feed a Bull Terrier\u202f Bull Terriers should be fed a balanced diet of high-quality dog food, and any commercially available food you choose should be approved by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) to ensure it provides proper nutrition and meets all necessary regulations.\u202f\u00a0 Dr. Shapard adds that, for any dog, the proper food \u201cdepends on the life stage and any pre-existing condition that particular dog has.\u201d In general, she says her go-to recommendation will always be based on evidence-based commercial diets, such as Royal Canin, Purina, and Hill\u2019s Science Diet. \u201cAll three of these pet food brands employ board-certified veterinary nutritionists to test, monitor, and oversee the nutritional requirements and standards of these diets, for both prescription diets and non-prescription diets,\u201d she says.\u202f\u00a0\u202f\u00a0 She warns that some of the more novel brand diets do not go through the same regulatory safety checks and may not be overseen by a licensed veterinary nutritionist. \u201cThere is a lot of misinformation online created by people with no veterinary degree or valid experience, so it is vital for the health and wellbeing of pets to make sure the [parents] are doing their due diligence in finding the right resources,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the best way to do that is to reach out to a licensed veterinarian.\u201d\u00a0 How To Feed a Bull Terrier\u202f Bull Terriers typically love to eat, so feed them a measured amount of an age-appropriate (puppy, adult, or senior) dog food twice a day. Avoid leaving food out all the time, or \u201cfree-feeding\u201d them, since these dogs can become overweight quite easily.\u00a0 How Much Should You Feed a Bull Terrier?\u00a0 Feed your Bull Terrier following the measurements outlined on their dog food label twice a day. Depending on the food, as well as your dog\u2019s age and size, the total daily amount will likely be between 1\u215d\u202fand 4\u00bc cups. Keep in mind that this breed loves to eat and, although they tend to be quite active, they can also put on excess weight if you overfeed or over-treat them.\u202f\u00a0\u00a0 Nutritional Tips for Bull Terriers\u00a0 Natural calcium is particularly important for Bull Terriers, especially when they\u2019re young, to support their growth and bone development. Their food alone may be a sufficient source, but if not, talk to your vet about other dog-safe high-calcium foods or supplements you can add during periods of rapid growth.\u202f Behavior and Training Tips for Bull Terriers\u202f  Bull Terrier Personality and Temperament\u202f\u00a0 Playful and clownish, the Bull Terrier is an active, energetic dog that Bebb says is \u201clike a 3-year-old child in a dog suit.\u201d They\u2019re generally loving and affectionate, but they don\u2019t save all that adoration for [only] their family and will happily climb onto the lap of the next person offering a treat and a cuddle\u2014unless they\u2019re feeling independent, in which case, Bebb says, they may want nothing to do with you. And they very well may display all of these attributes within the span of a few minutes.\u202f\u00a0 Although they\u2019re affectionate with family\u2014including children\u2014they are not always dog- or cat-friendly. Early and frequent socialization and training is key, and supervision with small children is always recommended with any breed.\u202f\u00a0 Bull Terrier Behavior\u202f\u00a0 Regular exercise is a must for Bull Terriers. A daily walk is a good start, but this energetic breed may need additional physical and/or mental stimulation to be his best self.\u202f\u00a0 \u202fAlong with exercise, this friendly pooch needs plenty of human companionship. If left alone for hours, they can make quick work of a couch cushion (or anything else they can get their mouth on), and they\u2019re prone to developing compulsive behaviors, like tail chasing, if they aren\u2019t given enough attention or stimulation.\u202f\u00a0\u00a0 Bull Terrier Training\u00a0 This is not the easiest breed to train, but Bull Terriers have the ability to learn just about anything if they\u2019re properly incentivized. Making training sessions enjoyable and interesting is the key to getting your Bull Terrier to learn good behaviors, but you must be consistent and frequent with your training, starting at the puppy stage.\u00a0 Bull Terriers may not always pick up on lessons the first time around, but that\u2019s likely due to insufficient motivation and their willful nature, not a lack of intelligence. Despite their need for human interaction, the Bull Terrier is an independent dog. So if you want them to do something, reward them with treats, toys, and belly rubs. Because they\u2019re such big eaters, dog treats are a fantastic way to keep them motivated, but be careful not to give them so many that they become overweight.\u00a0 Fun Activities for Bull Terriers\u202f\u00a0 Agility\u202f\u00a0 Fast CAT (a timed 100-yard dash competition)\u00a0 Obedience training\u00a0 Nose work/tracking\u00a0 Bull Terrier Grooming Guide\u202f  Grooming your Bull Terrier is one of the easiest aspects of living with this breed, thanks to their short coats and healthy ears and eyes.\u00a0 Skin Care\u202f\u00a0 Some Bull Terriers may develop itchy skin due to allergies (called atopic dermatitis), especially on their feet, belly, folds of skin, and ears. If left untreated, this can lead to secondary infection where the dog has scratched, causing serious discomfort.\u202f\u00a0 There are several possible causes for allergies, ranging from food to indoor and/or outdoor environmental allergens. If you and your veterinarian are able to determine and address the cause, that\u2019s the best place to start. However, it\u2019s more likely that you\u2019ll need to treat the symptoms, in which case your veterinarian might recommend a medicated bath, topical treatment, or oral medication.\u202f\u00a0\u00a0 Coat Care\u202f\u00a0 While Bull Terriers do shed\u2014quite a lot, according to Bebb\u2014they generally require little more than a quick weekly once-over with a soft-bristled brush. Even when they do get dirty, they tend to ditch much of the dirt they\u2019ve picked up by the time they reach the front door, so baths are rarely necessary. There\u2019s no need to bring in a pro for this pup.\u00a0\u00a0 Eye Care\u202f\u00a0 Other than a slight propensity for dry eye later in life, Bull Terriers don\u2019t have special eye care considerations.\u202f\u00a0\u00a0 Ear Care\u202f\u00a0 A Bull Terrier typically has healthy ears when it comes to likelihood of infection, and regular ear cleaning should be all that\u2019s required. However, because hereditary deafness is a known issue in the breed, puppies (especially white Bull Terrier puppies) should undergo a brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) test to check their hearing.\u00a0 Considerations for Pet Parents\u202f\u00a0 If you\u2019re interested in adding a Bull Terrier to your home, first make sure you\u2019re prepared to truly make them a part of the family. They need a lot of human interaction and can become destructive if left home alone for long periods. They\u2019ll also need exercise, training, and socialization in order to be the nice family dog you want. Additionally, keep in mind that they\u2019re quite tolerant of heat, but not of cold. If you live in a damp or chilly climate, you\u2019ll need to have coats or sweaters on hand for your dog."}]
