They are small dogs, weighing in at 6\u201314\u00a0pounds\u00a0and 7\u201310 inches tall. They are known for their expressive, almost childlike faces and large, wide-set prominent eyes. Their stocky bodies and characteristic, purposeful trot\u00a0are\u00a0reflections of their heritage as vermin hunters in Belgium. Caring for a Brussels Griffon Brussels Griffons belong to a class of dogs called brachycephalic dogs, characterized by a short snout and flat-faced appearance. This makes them more prone to snore and more sensitive to hot, humid weather. They should not be left outside for extended periods of time. Conversely, given their small size, they do not tolerate extreme cold either. \u00a0 They also love companionship and are known as \u201cVelcro\u201d dogs to their adoring humans. So if you are planning on adding a Brussels Griffon to your family, be prepared for a dog that wants to spend all their time with you. Brussels Griffon Health Issues  Fortunately, Brussels Griffons are a generally healthy breed with few health concerns. Areas to ask the breeder or your veterinarian about include screening for any heart conditions, eye defects such as cataracts, or orthopedic issues including patella luxation and hip dysplasia.\u00a0 Hip Dysplasia\u00a0 Hip Dysplasia\u00a0is an instability or loose fit of the hip joint, which occurs in growing dogs because the hip socket does not fully cover the ball portion of the femur (thigh bone). This can result in hip arthritis and pain. Clinical signs of hip dysplasia are more prominent in large breed dogs, but luckily, with their small stature, Brussels Griffons typically have minimal signs of pain or discomfort, which can usually be managed with a joint supplement or medication. Rarely do they need surgical intervention. \u00a0 If you are concerned about your Brussels Griffon suffering from hip dysplasia, talk with your veterinarian about PennHIP screening. These specialized x-rays of a dog\u2019s pelvis can detect if a dog will develop hip dysplasia in their lifetime.\u00a0 Medial Patella Luxation\u00a0 Medial patella luxation\u00a0is a condition where the kneecap slips in and out of place. This can result in knee arthritis and pain. Clinical signs will be more pronounced in larger breed dogs, so it may be hard to spot the signs in a Brussels Griffon. Often a joint supplement or anti-inflammatory medication will be sufficient for small breed dogs. However, if the luxation is severe, surgery may be recommended to correct the issue and keep the\u00a0kneecap\u00a0in place. \u00a0 Eye Issues\u00a0 Brussels Griffons can be predisposed to cataracts, progressive retinal\u00a0atrophy\u00a0(PRA), and eye injuries.\u00a0 Cataracts, or cloudiness of the lens of the eye, can be corrected surgically by a veterinary ophthalmologist if it occurs. PRA\u00a0is an inherited form of degenerative ocular disease with no treatment or cure. It \u00a0progresses to blindness but is not painful for the pet. Finally, due to their prominent eyes, Brussels Griffons are prone to eye injuries such as scratches or irritation. If your dog\u2019s eyes are red or they are rubbing at them, it is recommended that you check with your veterinarian. \u00a0 Dental Disease\u00a0 Adult dogs generally have 42 teeth. But Brussels Griffons, with their \u201csmoosh-faced\u201d anatomy, have less space to fit these 42 teeth, causing crowding and sometimes odd angles of the teeth. This can increase tartar and trap food or debris at an earlier age than non-brachycephalic dogs. Therefore, dental care is very important and Brussels Griffons will likely benefit from at-home tooth brushing as well as routine dental cleanings done by your veterinarian. What to Feed a Brussels Griffon  There are lots of diets on the market, and finding the right food for your Brussels Griffon can be overwhelming. Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO)-approved food is a good place to start to ensure that the food you select meets standard nutritional requirements and regulations for pet foods. Other considerations for the Brussels Griffon include small-bite or small-breed diets, due to their size, and\u00a0possibly a vet-approved\u00a0dental diet given their propensity for dental issues. However, be sure to consult with your veterinarian\u00a0regarding\u00a0your pet\u2019s specific needs when selecting a diet. \u00a0 How to Feed a Brussels Griffon\u00a0 As small breed dogs, Brussels Griffons will appreciate a few feedings throughout the day\u2014 typically two or three. They can be slightly picky or finicky eaters so choosing a highly palatable diet or even utilizing food toppers may be useful. Be sure to select a diet that is appropriate for your pet\u2019s life stage (puppy, adult, or senior). \u00a0 How Much Should You Feed a Brussels Griffon\u00a0 When determining how much to feed your dog, it\u2019s important to read the instructions on the bag or can. The caloric content of each food can vary significantly, and therefore the food bag or can is the best place to make that determination. Typically, you will need to know your pet\u2019s age and weight to compare to the chart on the bag. Maintaining a healthy weight and monitoring your pet\u2019s caloric intake are keys to a healthy lifestyle. So be sure to discuss your Brussels griffon\u2019s ideal weight with your veterinarian and adjust the amount you are feeding based on ideal weight, not current weight. Also, don\u2019t forget that treats count as calories too. While they are great for training, giving too many can lead to\u00a0overweight\u00a0pups. Nutritional Tips for Brussels Griffon\u00a0 Always discuss any supplements or diet aids with your veterinarian prior to starting them, to ensure they are right for your pet. Brussels Griffons may benefit from omega-3 fatty acid supplements to keep their gorgeous coats healthy and shiny. They may also benefit from joint supplements with glucosamine and chondroitin to maintain healthy cartilage. \u00a0 Behavior and Training Tips for Brussels Griffon  Brussels Griffon Personality and Temperament\u00a0 Brussels Griffons are big personalities in small packages. Known for their childlike expressions and intelligence, this breed will keep you entertained. These dogs are best suited to those owners who prioritize companionship and are prepared to spend a lot of time with their dog. They are considered \u201cVelcro dogs\u201d and do not like to be left alone for extended periods of time. They will flourish in settings where they can be a central part of the family. Brussels Griffons have a medium energy level and will do fine with up to 30 minutes of moderate activity or walks per day. They are happy to get up and go, or to take more of a lounging role as long as they are with their loving owner. \u00a0 Brussels Griffon Behavior Brussels Griffons typically do well in families with children, other dogs, or cats, but they can be sensitive, so supervision is recommended. Similarly, they can be nervous around strangers or in new situations. However, Brussels Griffons are usually not aggressive or overly vocal. In general, they are fun-loving, happy dogs, but expect them to bark when someone knocks at the door. Brussels Griffon Training\u00a0 Brussels Griffons are smart and have a strong bond with their owners, making them easy to train. They will benefit from socialization and puppy training classes to help ensure a well-rounded, confident dog with good manners. Most Brussels Griffons also enjoy tricks training, and some will do very well in agility classes. \u00a0 As with many toy breeds, Brussels Griffons can take some extra time with potty training and patience is the key. Due to their sensitive nature, Brussels Griffons do not respond well to harsh correction and require more of a gentle approach. They will also often develop undesirable behaviors if left alone for long periods of time, as they strongly prefer to be with their owners. Fun Activities for Brussels Griffon Tricks class \u00a0 Agility Up to 30-minute daily walks Cuddling Brussels Griffon Grooming Guide Brussels Griffons come in four colors: red, beige (black and reddish brown with black\u00a0face),\u00a0black and tan, and black. There are also two types of Brussels Griffon coats\u2014smooth and rough. The length of their coat will affect the level of grooming needs you can expect. Skin Care\u00a0 As brachycephalic dogs, Brussels Griffons have a nose fold that needs to be kept clean and dry. \u00a0Their face folds should be cleaned around once a week. You can use a warm, wet wash cloth to wipe the area, but be sure to dry it off afterward to prevent accumulation of bacteria or yeast. Coat Care\u00a0 The smooth-coated Brussels Griffons have a straight, short, glossy coat that requires occasional baths and daily to weekly brushing. You can expect this coat type to shed a moderate amount. \u00a0 iStock.com/CaptureLightThe rough-coated Brussels Griffons have a wiry, dense coat and characteristic beards. Rough-coated\u00a0Brussels\u00a0Griffons will have moderate grooming demands, requiring professional grooming every 4\u20138 weeks in addition to occasional baths and weekly brushing. The rough-coated Brussels Griffons do not shed, unlike their smooth-coated counterparts. \u00a0 iStock.com/CaptureLightAs with all breeds, nail trims should be performed to keep the nails neat and short. \u00a0 Eye Care\u00a0 Brussels\u00a0Griffons have large, prominent eyes that are prone to injury. If your dog\u2019s eyes are red or they are rubbing at them, it is recommended that you check with your veterinarian.\u00a0 Ear Care\u00a0 Regular ear cleanings should be performed, especially at bath time. If you notice debris in the ear or odor, please contact your veterinarian. \u00a0 Considerations for Pet Parents\u00a0 The Brussels Griffon can be classified as a clingy dog, so it is best for a pet owner who wants to spend a lot of time with them. They are also a bit tricky to potty train, so experience and a lot of patience is recommended. The most prominent health concern for pet parents to be aware of when considering a Brussels Griffon is their brachycephalic classification. Brachycephalic dogs have\u00a0short snouts and a \u201cflat-faced\u201d appearance, which impedes their ability to pant effectively, making them prone to overheating. Care should be taken to limit exercise and extended periods of time outside during the summer months and during poor air quality days. \u00a0\u00a0"}]
