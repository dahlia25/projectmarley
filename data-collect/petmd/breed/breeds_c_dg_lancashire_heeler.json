Because these dogs are self-made from breeding on their own, it is unknown if there were any other dog breeds added into the making of the Lancashire Heeler. Originating in Great Britain, this dog breed was used by farmers for cattle driving. Although much smaller than the usual cattle driving dog, the Lancashire Heeler did its job by keeping the cattle moving without injuring itself or the stock.
