Learn more about caring for Akita puppies and dogs.", "articleBody": "The Akita is a dog breed originally found in Japan. After World War II, there were fewer than 50 Akitas remaining in Japan. In response, a determined group of people worked to bring back and preserve the breed. Their efforts proved successful, and now we see the breed in households across the globe. Akitas were originally bred for big game hunting and protection. and are now used as police dogs in Japan. The breed can range in weight from 70 to 130 pounds\u2014with male Akitas typically heavier than females. Their average height ranges from 24 to 28 inches, so they are considered to be a large-breed dog. Caring for an Akita Akitas are known for their plush, curled tails that often differ from dog to dog. Since they are a large breed, it\u2019s important to be conscious of their feeding amounts to ensure they stay at a healthy weight. Akitas are very strong-willed and require appropriate training and socialization from a young age in order to thrive. Akitas can be sensitive to heat because of their thick coat, so they would do best in a cooler climate. Akitas can also be predisposed to joint issues\u2014particularly hip and elbow issues\u2014so they should be routinely monitored by their veterinarian. Akita Health Issues Typically, the Akita is a healthy and hardy breed, but there are some health issues to keep in mind. Hip Dysplasia As a large-breed-dog, Akitas can be prone to hip dysplasia, an orthopedic condition that affects the hip joints and can lead to lameness (limping). If you are concerned about your Akita\u2019s risk for hip dysplasia, talk with your veterinarian about PennHIP screening. This is a screening method that uses specialized x-rays of the pelvis to detect if a dog is likely to develop hip dysplasia in their lifetime. If a dog already has or is likely to develop hip dysplasia, it\u2019s very important that they do not become overweight. Your veterinarian will also recommend an appropriate exercise routine, and may suggest general joint support throughout your pet\u2019s life with joint supplements and potentially specialized diets. If a dog is severely affected by hip dysplasia, your veterinarian may recommend a surgical option to correct this issue and improve your Akita\u2019s mobility and quality of life.\u00a0 Hypothyroidism Akitas can also be diagnosed with hypothyroidism, a health condition in which their body does not produce enough thyroid hormone. This condition can be screened for and monitored via routine blood work. If your dog is diagnosed with hypothyroidism, they will very likely require lifelong medication, specifically an oral thyroid hormone replacement. What to Feed an Akita Akitas do well on a large-breed dog food. This is particularly important when they are puppies as a large-breed-specific puppy diet will ensure that they do not grow too fast and potentially cause orthopedic issues. An AAFCO (Association of American Feed Control Officials)-approved food is a great option because it means that the food meets the standard nutritional requirements and regulations for pet foods. How to Feed an Akita Akitas can be fed similarly to any other large-breed dog. Two to three meals spaced throughout the day would suit them well.\u00a0 Individual dogs may eat quicker than others, so if your dog is eating too fast, this is something to discuss with your veterinarian. Specific types of dog bowls and feeders are specially made to help dogs eat at a slower pace\u2014these typically come in the form of spiral bowls, puzzle toys, or texturized feeding mats. How Much You Should Feed an Akita Determining the right amount of food for an Akita will in part be decided by the type of food you choose and your veterinarian\u2019s recommendation. Since Akitas are prone to hip and joint issues, keeping them at a healthy weight through appropriate meal portions is very important. If you feel like your Akita is gaining too much weight, be sure to talk with your veterinarian to figure out an appropriate weight management plan. Nutritional Tips for an Akita Akitas can benefit from joint support throughout their lives to help maintain their joint health and mobility. Your veterinarian can provide you with recommendations about the best products, as there are varying levels of joint supplements that can cater to your Akita\u2019s age and current joint situation. Akita Grooming Guide The Akita is a fairly heavy shedding breed, so you should be prepared for routine grooming. Skin Care Akitas do not have any unique skin attributes or sensitivities Coat Care Akitas have a thick double coat that sheds seasonally and requires frequent brushing. The frequency of brushing will increase about twice a year as they are shedding. Akitas normally require frequent brushing, one or more times each week, as well as regular baths. Eye Care It is important to make sure your Akita\u2019s eyes are clean and free of discharge. Also, if an Akita is diagnosed with hypothyroidism, it can cause decreased tear production, so be sure to talk with your veterinarian to see if eye drops will be needed. Ear Care Akitas can also benefit from occasional ear cleanings to prevent buildup of wax in the outer\u00a0 ears.\u00a0"}]
