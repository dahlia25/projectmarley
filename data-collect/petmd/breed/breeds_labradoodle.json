PetMD is operated by Chewy.\u00a0 The popular Labradoodle\u2014a mixed breed of Labrador Retriever and Standard Poodle\u2014is beloved for her minimal shedding and affectionate nature. The smart, playful pups are excellent family dogs, but pet parents must be devoted to supplying their four-legged friends with the proper training, a moderate amount of daily exercise, a regular grooming schedule, and plenty of love.\u00a0 Caring for a Labradoodle Labradoodles have long, curly coats that require an extensive grooming routine to keep their tresses from becoming unruly, which can lead to uncomfortable mats and knots. While the breed is often referred to as \u201chypoallergenic,\u201d no dog is truly allergen-free, though Labradoodles are known for their minimal shedding.\u202f\u00a0 These teddy-bear-face beauties can weigh between 50-75 pounds and can be about 25 inches tall full-grown. They can thrive in homes of all sizes\u2014as long as they\u2019re given the right amount of daily exercise. Labradoodles are extremely friendly and loyal, making them wonderful family dogs. They are also easy to train and ideal for first-time pet parents seeking a companion with a big personality.\u00a0 Labradoodle Health Issues  Because Labradoodles are a mix of Labrador Retriever and Standard Poodle, they are prone to the common health conditions of both breeds, including congenital eye issues, hip dysplasia, and heart disease, says Jamie Whittenburg, DVM.\u202f\u00a0 While pet insurance can help pet parents manage the costs of dealing with these health issues, these conditions can also be prevented by Labradoodle breeders thoroughly screening their breeding stock. \u201cThis should include genetic testing, eye exams, OFA or PennHip testing, and echocardiograms,\u201d Whittenburg says.\u00a0\u00a0 Congenital Eye Issues\u00a0 These conditions can emerge in the form of progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) and glaucoma. PRA is an inherited disorder that causes the deterioration of the retina, a light-sensitive layer of cells in the eye, which can gradually lead to blindness, says Rhea Morgan, DVM, for Veterinary Information Network\u2019s Veterinary Partner. It isn\u2019t a painful condition, but warning signs can include night blindness (for example, your pup might be clumsy in the dark or refuse to go outside in dim light). While there is no treatment for PRA, it can take months or years for the disease to fully impair a dog\u2019s eyesight.\u00a0 Cataracts are common in dogs, Labradoodles included, and cause clouding in the eyes that can eventually lead to vision loss, according to Wendy Brooks, DVM, for Veterinary Partner. If you notice your Labradoodle\u2019s lenses have a cloudy or opaque appearance or that your buddy\u2019s vision has become more limited, consult a veterinarian. There are no medical therapies currently available to reduce or \u201ccure\u201d cataracts; surgery is the only option. Untreated cataracts are painful and can lead to blindness.\u00a0 Hip Dysplasia\u202f\u00a0 Hip dysplasia is a common condition suffered by large- and giant-breed dogs. This condition happens as your Labradoodle puppy grows and the hips develop abnormally. Discomfort is often displayed by pups via reduced activity and/or difficulty rising or lying down or going up stairs.\u202f\u00a0 There are many options for treating hip dysplasia\u2014from nutrition supplements to anti-inflammatory medications to surgery\u2014but it\u2019s vital to consult your vet to find the best one for your Labradoodle. Heart Disease\u202f\u00a0 Heart disease is a common issue for many dog breeds, including Labradoodles, and can be caused by underlying conditions such as heart valve degeneration, irregular heart rate and rhythm (arrhythmia), and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). \u202f\u00a0 The Morris Animal Foundation, which funds canine heart disease studies, urges pet parents to look for signs, such as:\u00a0\u00a0 Persistent cough\u00a0 Fainting or collapse\u00a0 Difficulty breathing\u00a0 Fatigue\u00a0 Behavior changes (loss of appetite, reluctance to engage, etc.)\u202f\u00a0 If you notice any of these signs, make an appointment with your vet so they can perform screenings such as chest x-rays, blood tests, and an echocardiogram (an ultrasound of the heart and nearby blood vessels) to assess the issue. The condition can be serious if left untreated, but thankfully there are many treatment options available, such as diet therapy and medication.\u202f\u00a0 What To Feed a Labradoodle\u202f To live a long and happy life, Labradoodles must consume the proper amount of high-quality dog food and have access to fresh water. A balanced diet will help your pup maintain a healthy weight and avoid health conditions such as heart disease and hip dysplasia.\u00a0\u00a0 If a pet parent is willing and able to cook for their dog, Whittenburg suggests a fresh, homemade diet that has been formulated by a board-certified veterinary nutritionist. \u201cIt is essential to prepare the diet exactly as formulated, as it is very dangerous to stray from the diet as nutritional imbalances are likely to occur,\u201d Whittenburg says. \u201cIf [pet parents] are unable or unwilling to cook for their pet, I suggest a World Small Animal Veterinary Association\u2013complaint food, such as Purina ProPlan, Hill\u2019s Science Diet, and Royal Canin.\u00a0Boutique brand and grain-free foods should be avoided.\u201d\u00a0 When choosing a food, pet parents should look for options approved by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO).\u00a0\u00a0 How To Feed a Labradoodle\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s very important that your pup eats a complete and balanced diet. That includes servings of food in the right amount that provides more than 40 nutrients that pets require in their respective life stages, including proteins, fats, carbs, and vitamins, minerals, and independent amino acids, according to the Pet Food Institute. \u00a0 How Much Should You Feed a Labradoodle?\u202f\u00a0 While there is no one-size-fits-all way to feed a Labradoodle and a consultation with your vet is recommended, Whittenburg says Labradoodle puppies under 6 months old should generally be fed a minimum of three times a day and adult dogs should be fed twice a day.\u202f\u00a0 \u201c\u200b\u200bThough adults can technically be fed once a day, this can lead to anxiety and hyperfixation on meals. It is better for the dog\u2019s metabolism and mental health to be fed every 12 hours,\u201d she says. \u201cMore frequent feeding can also help guard against serious health issues, such as gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), as the dog will consume a smaller amount of food and likely eat more slowly.\u201d\u00a0 Nutritional Tips for Labradoodles You should avoid feeding your pup table scraps, which may be high in calories or fat\u2014and they can even be dangerous. Treats should make up only 10% of your dog\u2019s calorie intake and never replace a diet.\u00a0\u00a0 Unless recommended by a veterinarian, dogs fed a complete and balanced commercial food diet should not need any nutritional supplements. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to pick a food that\u2019s catered to your Labradoodle\u2019s life stage, whether she\u2019s a puppy, adult, or senior.\u202f\u00a0 However, Labradoodles that are fed a homemade diet may require supplements to ensure they are getting all the vitamins and minerals necessary to thrive, including omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, glucosamine, and a variety of antioxidants.\u202f\u00a0 Behavior and Training Tips for Labradoodles Labradoodle Personality and Temperament\u00a0\u00a0 The high-energy, attention-seeking, intelligent Labradoodle requires frequent exercise, interaction, and play. \u201cLabradoodles do best in homes with active [pet parents who] have time to devote to the dog, as well as [families] with adolescents to older children,\u201d says Whittenburg.\u202f\u00a0\u00a0 The jolly Labradoodle\u2019s amicable and playful qualities make them a prime companion for any household, including those with young children, feline friends, and other dogs. While every Labradoodle is different, proper socialization is a must for helping your dog become a well-behaved companion.\u00a0 \u201cLabradoodles tend to do great with other animals and younger children if introduced slowly and properly,\u201d Christos Philippou, a dog trainer at Del K9 Academy. \u201cRushed introductions can lead to issues, so work with a trainer if you have any questions to make sure it goes as smoothly as possible.\u201d\u00a0 Labradoodle Behavior\u202f\u00a0 Labradoodles adore company and relish time spent with their humans, but hate being left alone for long periods of time. These dogs are not known to be excessive barkers, but the right amount of training and exercise is required to ensure they learn to behave appropriately.\u202f\u00a0 \u201cThey are incredible family dogs but certainly need a dedicated [pet parent] to work on their physical and mental needs,\u201d says Philippou.\u00a0 Labradoodle Training\u00a0 Because Labradoodles are a hybrid of two highly intelligent breeds, they are eager to please and highly trainable, according to Philippou. They can be taught to excel at everything from basic tricks like sit, stay, and roll over to running agility courses.\u202f\u00a0 Always use positive-reinforcement techniques, like using treats to reward good behaviors, during training. It\u2019s also important to train Labradoodle puppies at a very young age to ensure they develop good habits that will last throughout their lifetime and minimize mischievous behavior. Due to their gentle and sharp-witted nature, Labradoodles can even be trained to become service dogs.\u00a0\u00a0 Fun Activities for Labradoodles\u00a0 Walking or running\u00a0 Hiking\u00a0 Frisbee\u00a0 Swimming\u00a0 Dock diving\u00a0 Hunting\u00a0 Dog park\u00a0 Tug-of-war\u00a0 Chase\u00a0 Agility training\u00a0 Labradoodle Grooming Guide\u202f No Labradoodle is alike in size or personality\u2014and they have varying coats to match. \u201cSome have tight curls while some have loose, flowing locks of hair,\u201d says Katlin Primrose, CAPG, CSP, a groomer and veterinary technician in Calgary, Canada. While the breed is favored for having low-shedding levels, the dogs\u2019 coats require a high-maintenance care routine that involves regular brushing and visits to a professional groomer.\u202f\u00a0\u202f\u00a0 Skin Care\u202f\u00a0 While Labradoodles don\u2019t require a regular bathing routine, they may require a splash in the shower or tub if they get wet or dirty from romps outside. In that case, [pet parents] should use a hypoallergenic, soothing oat-based dog shampoo,\u201d says Paola Cuevas, MZV and behavioral specialist.\u00a0 Coat Care\u00a0 To avoid painful tangles and matting, particularly around friction points such as the ears, bum, and between the legs, Primrose urges Labradoodle parents to brush their dogs twice a week.\u202f\u00a0 \u201cPay special attention to friction areas,\u201d she says. \u201cEnsure you\u2019re getting down to the skin, but don\u2019t go over the same spot more than twice, as you may cause brush burn. If there is too much matting, it becomes painful, and it will force [a groomer] to shave your dog down to the skin.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0Philippou recommends brushing your Labradoodle daily to prevent knots and mats and making an appointment with a professional groomer every 2-3 months to ensure the dog\u2019s coat isn\u2019t becoming overgrown.\u202f\u00a0 Eye Care\u00a0 Keep your pup\u2019s bangs (or fringe) trimmed to ensure their fluffy locks don\u2019t obstruct their vision. Because Labradoodles are prone to congenital eye conditions such as progressive retinal atrophy and glaucoma, pet parents should also keep an eye on respective symptoms, such as impaired night vision and cloudy lenses.\u202f\u00a0 Ear Care\u202f\u00a0 Ear infections can be an issue for Labradoodles, so it\u2019s important to keep a close eye on your pet\u2019s ear hygiene and clean their ears regularly, particularly during and after bath time and if your pup goes for a swim. \u201cMaking sure to keep them clean and dry is the best way to prevent these problems,\u201d Cuevas says.\u202f\u00a0 Considerations for Pet Parents\u00a0 Whether you love taking long strolls or hiking in the wilds, your Labradoodle will make the perfect (leashed!) adventure partner. These dogs are very loving and affectionate, but pet parents should be prepared to give them at least 1 hour of exercise daily. That could include one or two walks or a game of fetch in the yard or dog park. If the breed receives the proper amount of physical and mental stimulation, they can live in homes of all sizes, though one with a yard is preferred.\u202f\u00a0 Labradoodle puppies must also be trained at a young age to minimize their mischievous tendencies and enable them to withstand long and consistent grooming sessions (a must for the breed).\u202f\u00a0"}]
