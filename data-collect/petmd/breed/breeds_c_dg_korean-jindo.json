All from the real vets at PetMD.", "articleBody": "By Paula Fitzsimmons With erect ears, a thick tail and an athletic build, the Korean Jindo is a wolflike dog breed originating in South Korea. Jindo dogs are excellent problem solvers, are fiercely loyal and have a strong drive to hunt, traits that have secured their position as hunters and guardians in their homeland. They continue to serve in these roles to a certain degree in the US, but Jindo dogs have primarily become cherished family members. The American Kennel Club (AKC) has not yet recognized the Korean Jindo as a new dog breed; it is in the organization\u2019s Foundation Stock Service awaiting recognition. Many American Jindo breeders rely on the breed standards set by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI). Physical Characteristics Like the Akita, American Eskimo Dog, Chow Chow, Siberian Husky and other dog breeds with a wolflike appearance, the Korean Jindo is a Spitz breed. Jindo dogs are athletic, well-proportioned, medium-size\u00a0pups who differ distinctly by their sex. Females tend to look slimmer with more angular features, while males tend to be stockier and more broadly built,\u00a0says Nichole Royer, a founding member of the Korean Jindo Association of America. \u00a0 The FCI standard height for males is 19 \u00bd-21 \u00bd inches with a weight of 40-50 pounds. Females are a couple of inches shorter and weigh 33-41 pounds, says Royer. Like wolves, the Jindo\u2019s ears are heavily furred and have rounded tips. \u201cVery importantly, when alert, their ears are hooded, meaning they lean forward past the vertical when viewed from the side, and they never have ears that simply point straight up,\u201d Royer says. They have strong, well-feathered tails. \u201cJindos may carry their tail loosely curled with the tip brushing the back, or may have a sickle tail with a gentle curve carried high and not touching their back, or they may have a saber tail, pointing straight up. Their tails never curl tightly and never lay on their back or side,\u201d says Royer. Jindo dogs have a double coat consisting of a soft, fuzzy undercoat and stiff outercoat, which Royer says presents in six general colors: red, white, black and tan, brindle, gray, and solid black. \u201cThey have a quick and elastic trot, which makes it easy for the Jindo to travel quickly over any terrain,\u201d says Gina DiNardo, executive secretary of the AKC in New York City. Being able to move rapidly on any type of landscape is essential to hunting success. Personality and Temperament Jindos are fiercely loyal and protective, traits they tend to reserve for one person or family. \u201cWhile they should be calm, confident and never aggressive without reason, they are also a reserved and careful breed that often is not particularly interested in interacting with people or dogs outside their own family and pack,\u201d explains Royer. \u00a0However, \u201ca\u00a0well-socialized Jindo will accept and even enjoy attention from someone who is accepted by their owner,\u201d Royer says.\u00a0 The Jindo dog breed is highly independent and has a strong aptitude for problem-solving. \u201cJindos are able to make decisions on their own and are not necessarily looking to their owners for direction. While very intelligent and easily trained, they are also easily bored,\u201d says Royer. If you plan to get more than one Jindo, consider the dogs\u2019 sex. \u201cSame-sex dog aggression is the norm for the breed, and opposite-sex companions are the most successful,\u201d says Royer.\u00a0 As a breed with a high prey drive, Jindos need daily physical exercise and mental stimulation. \u201cOutdoors, they are very active, continually looking for prey and patrolling the property,\u201d Royer says. \u201cInside the home, they are alert and like to position themselves near their owners. However, they are restful and calm indoor companions.\u201d They will often follow their human around the house, \u201cnot being clingy, but happy to curl up in a corner where they can simply be near and watch over their person or family,\u201d says DiNardo. Care When provided an outlet for their energy, Jindos are calm and quiet while indoors, says Royer. \u201cAs a guard dog breed, Jindos are programmed to observe and react to anything unusual or out of place in their environment. For this reason, they require socialization as puppies so that they develop a broad concept of what is normal in the world.\u201d Though intensely loyal to the family, Jindo dogs are also independent thinkers. \u201cThey will temper their obedience with their own judgment,\u201d Royer says. \u201cIt is best for owners to take their dogs through one or more training classes to cement their bond and provide good basic Canine Good Citizen skills,\u201d says Royer. The Korean Jindo is an athletic breed that needs a reasonable amount of physical and mental stimulation, says DiNardo. \u201cThey enjoy sports like lure coursing and agility and are happy to turn their athleticism to any active task, even if it\u2019s a nice long walk.\u201d Jindos typically have little body odor and will often clean themselves, similar to a cat, says Royer. \u201cMost of the year they require weekly brushing to minimize shedding and an occasional bath. Twice a year Jindos will \u2018blow\u2019 their coat and most of their undercoat will come out in a fairly short period of time. During this time they will shed excessively and continuously, and daily brushing (and vacuuming) becomes necessary.\u201d Health Jindos are generally robust dogs who have few health issues. With optimal care, they have an average lifespan of 11 to 13 years. Health conditions that have been identified in multiple dogs are hypothyroidism and discoid lupus erythematosus (cutaneous lupus erythematosus), a skin disease that may cause a variety of symptoms, including depigmentation of the lip and nose, lesions that can bleed, loss of tissue and scar formation, says Royer. There have also been isolated cases of cataracts, hip dysplasia, seizures, environmental allergies and cystinuria, an inherited disease that leads to kidney, ureter and bladder stones, Royer says. \u201cHowever, none of these issues have been documented with frequency.\u201d A responsible breeder will test for these diseases. \u00a0 History and Background The Korean Jindo originated on Jindo Island, which is located off South Korea\u2019s southwest coast.\u00a0 \u201cThe dogs lived unrestrained on the island alongside their owners for thousands of years to develop into a natural breed with reputable hunting abilities,\u201d DiNardo explains. \u201cJindos were originally used as hunting dogs in their native country due to their prey instinct and strict loyalty.\u201d They were expected to hunt and kill small game, then bring the prey home, says Royer. \u201cThey also hunted deer and wild boar in small packs. This hunting instinct is still very strong in the breed, and many owners still hunt with their dogs.\u201d Their strong hunting drive is also relied on here in the US. \u201cThere are many Jindos ridding their owners\u2019 property of vermin such as rats, squirrels and rabbits. Jindos have also proven excellent at lure coursing and barn-hunt activities,\u201d says Royer. In 1962, the Republic of Korea Preservation of Cultural Assets Act No. 53 was passed, which gave Jindos the title of \u201cNatural Monument (No. 53).\u201d\u00a0 The Jindo is not yet on the AKC breeds list but has been in its Foundation Stock Service since 2008, says DiNardo. \u201cIt is where breeds that are in the process of becoming recognized are grouped.\u201d Mixed-breed Jindo dogs and rescued imports from Korea are fairly common, and there are occasionally litters from parents that are supposedly purebred but unregistered, says Royer. \u201cThere are only around 20 AKC-registered Jindos in the US. We only have two breeders in the US who are actively involved with the breed, [who] health test their dogs and carefully screen new owners. So we are still a very small group, but always hoping to grow,\u201d adds Royer."}]
