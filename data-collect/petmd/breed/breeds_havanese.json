PetMD is operated by Chewy. The Havanese is an energetic and entertaining toy breed belonging to the Barbichon family of dogs, along with the Bichon Frise, Bolognese and Maltese. Standing just under 1 one foot in height, a full-grown Havanese weighs between 7-13 pounds. Once known as the Havana Silk Dog or the Spanish Silk Poodle, the Havanese is the only dog breed native to Cuba. According to the Havanese Club of America, the ancestors of today\u2019s breed were brought from Spain to Cuba in the 1600s. During the Cuban Revolution in the 1950s, some Cubans fled to the U.S.\u2014bringing these little dogs with them. Caring for a Havanese The Havanese dog is smart, spirited, and highly trainable. They make good watch dogs but may bark excessively if not properly trained. Their medium-length coat can be straight or wavy and requires frequent brushing to stay free of tangles. The Havanese breed does best with daily walks and a moderate amount of play time. Havanese Health Issues The Havanese is a generally healthy breed that has a life expectancy between 14-16 years. Though these dogs have a long lifespan, they are predisposed to a handful of medical conditions. Progressive Retinal Atrophy Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is a group of diseases that cause the photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) on the retina to break down. Initially, the Havanese may have difficulty seeing in the dark, but over time the condition will result in complete blindness. In most cases, PRA is an inherited disease, so dogs with this condition should not be bred. There are currently no effective treatments available. Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes Disease Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease is a condition in which the head of the femur breaks down, likely secondary to lack of blood supply. As the bone breaks down, pain and limping can occur. Legg-Calve-Perthes occurs in young dogs, mostly in Havanese puppies less than 18 months of age. In some cases, pain can be controlled with medications. In severe cases, surgery may be recommended. Patellar Luxation The patella (kneecap) is a small bone that normally sits in a groove within the femur at the knee.\u00a0In dogs with\u00a0patellar luxation, the patella moves (luxates) outside of its assigned groove. This inappropriate movement can cause discomfort and may lead to arthritis.\u00a0 Many pets will skip or run on three legs when the patella is out of place. In some cases, this may only last a few steps until the knee returns to its proper alignment. In more severe cases, the patella remains out of place. In mild cases, joint supplements or anti-inflammatory medications are used to control pain and prevent arthritis. In the more severely affected dogs, surgery may be recommended. Dental Disease Dental disease is one of the most common conditions seen in dogs as they age, especially in small breeds like the Havanese. This is when bacterial tartar and plaque lead to inflammation of the tissues around the teeth and, eventually, to tooth and bone decay. The best way to prevent dental disease is through\u00a0daily tooth brushing\u00a0with a dog-specific toothpaste. Routine dental cleanings\u00a0are recommended to evaluate the mouth, remove plaque and tartar, polish teeth (to prevent future build up), and treat or extract teeth that are significantly unhealthy. Just like with humans, dental disease can be a painful condition and may even affect the health of a dog\u2019s internal organs. What To Feed a Havanese  Feeding a commercial kibble or wet food approved by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) is a good way to ensure your Havanese receives a complete and balanced diet.\u00a0 Havanese puppies should be fed a diet formulated specifically for puppies or designated for \u201call life stages.\u201d For adults, dental-focused diets may be recommended by your veterinarian to help prevent dental disease. How To Feed a Havanese As a toy breed, the Havanese dog will do best with two to three measured feedings per day. Havanese puppies should eat three to four small meals per day on a regular schedule to help maintain stable blood sugar. How Much Should You Feed a Havanese The recommended caloric intake for a Havanese varies from dog to dog and depends on their physical size, metabolism, neuter status, and activity level. The best way to determine portion sizes is to discuss with your veterinarian, who can calculate specific caloric needs. Additionally, the feeding guide labels on dog food packaging provides valuable information for pet parents. Care should be taken not to overfeed your Havanese, especially because excess weight puts extra strain on joints\u2014like the knee. Remember that calories in treats add up quickly! Nutritional Tips for Havanese Havanese dogs require a balance of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats to stay healthy and lean. They may benefit from the addition of omega-3 fatty acids into their diets. Omega-3 fatty acids can be found in skin and joint supplements, fish oil, and even in some specially formulated dog foods. These fatty acids act as natural anti-inflammatories that help to support the Havanese\u2019s skin, coat, kidneys, joints, and heart.

Some Havanese dogs may develop separation anxiety and may not tolerate being left alone in their crate all day.

Fun Activities for Havanese Dogs Obedience training Agility Nose work Scent walks Havanese Grooming Guide   The Havanese has a beautiful, shiny coat that\u2019s both thick and light. The coat may be straight or wavy and have numerous possible color combinations, including black, white, fawn, gold, and so many more. Their coat is naturally long and requires lots of grooming. But pet parents can make their grooming routine easier by cutting their dogs\u2019 hair into a short \u201cpuppy cut.\u201d Skin Care Routine bathing of your dog is recommended as needed to maintain healthy skin. But don\u2019t overdo it\u2014bathing a Havanese more frequently than twice a month may strip the skin of healthy oils that act as a barrier against allergens. Gentle, dog-specific shampoos are best. Coat Care The Havanese\u2019s long, silky coat must be brushed at least 3-4 days a week to prevent tangles and mats. Using a de-matting spray-on conditioner is helpful for breaking down tangles. Short-haired Havanese don\u2019t need as much weekly upkeep as long as their haircuts are scheduled regularly. Eye Care Wiping your Havanese\u2019s eyes daily with a soft, moist cloth will help remove debris. The hair around their eyes should be carefully trimmed to keep it from causing irritation. If squinting or eye discharge is noted, take your Havanese to the vet, as these can be signs of more serious eye conditions. Ear Care Cleaning your dog\u2019s ears every 1-2 weeks helps prevent ear infections. Redness, odor, and/or debris in the ears are signs an infection may be present. If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your veterinarian. Considerations for Pet Parents The Havanese is a wonderful family dog, and they attach to their humans quickly. They may resent being left alone and can develop separation anxiety, so they do best in homes where someone is always by their side. While usually gentle with children and other pets, early socialization and training are imperative. Havanese dogs can do well in all sorts of homes\u2014as long as they get routine exercise, brushing, and attention. That said, Havanese can be barky, and any neighbors with shared walls might not appreciate your dog always raising the alarm."}]
