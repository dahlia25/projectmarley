This compact little dog ranges in height from 12-15 inches at the shoulder and typically weighs between 13-17 pounds. They are bred with a nearly inexhaustible energy and remarkable intelligence.

And while this breed requires extensive exercise, the Jack Russell Terrier does not need a lot of grooming care due to their short coat. Parson Jack Russell Health Issues The Parson Russell Terrier is generally a healthy breed, but they are predisposed to a few health conditions. Patellar Luxation The patella (or \u201ckneecap\u201d) is a small bone that normally sits in a groove within the femur at the knee. In dogs with patellar luxation, the patella moves (or \u201cluxates\u201d) outside of its assigned groove when the knee is flexed. This inappropriate movement can cause discomfort and may lead to arthritis.\u00a0 Eye Conditions The Parson Jack Russell Terrier is predisposed to several types of eye problems, including some that can cause blindness and pain if not treated quickly. If a pet is squinting, rubbing his eyes, has red eyes, or has discharge, they should be seen by a veterinarian right away. Primary Lens Luxation: Primary lens luxation (PLL) is a hereditary condition seen in some lines of Parson Jack Russell Terriers. PLL occurs when the ligaments that hold the eye lens in place break down. This causes the lens to fall out of position, which can be painful and may lead to secondary glaucoma. Surgical removal may be recommended to control pain. Genetic testing for PLL is available.Glaucoma: Glaucoma is a painful condition that causes increased pressure within the eye. This can occur without an obvious cause (primary glaucoma) or due to a cause such as cataracts or lens luxation (secondary glaucoma). The most common signs of glaucoma are pain (squinting), discharge from the eye, lethargy, bulging eyes, or a cloudy/bluish color of the eye. If not treated quickly, blindness may occur.Cataracts: Cataracts are another common eye disease seen in Parson Russell Terriers. In most cases, the condition develops in older dogs as proteins and fibers in the lens of the eye break down, causing an opacity of the lens. This leads to blurred vision, which can progress to blindness. In most cases, this is an inherited condition, but cataracts can also be seen with diabetes mellitus or injuries to the lens.Dental Disease Dental disease is one of the most common conditions seen in dogs as they age, especially in small breeds like the Parson Russell Terrier. Bacterial tartar and plaque lead to inflammation of the tissues around the teeth and eventually to tooth and bone decay. The best way to prevent dental disease is with daily tooth brushing using a dog-specific toothpaste. Routine dental cleanings are recommended for your Jack Russell Terrier to evaluate the mouth, remove plaque and tartar, polish teeth to prevent future build up, and treat or extract teeth that are significantly unhealthy. Pulmonic Stenosis Pulmonic stenosis is a congenital disorder found in Parson Jack Russell Terriers. A heart murmur is almost always present with pulmonic stenosis. This heart defect occurs when there is an abnormal valve between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery that causes an obstruction of blood flow from the heart to the lungs. What To Feed a Parson Jack Russell Terrier Feeding an Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO)-compliant commercial kibble or wet food is a good way to make sure that the Parson Russell Terrier receives a complete and balanced diet.\u00a0 Parson Jack Russell Terrier puppies should be fed a diet formulated specifically for puppies or designated for \u201call life stages.\u201d For adults, dental-focused diets may be recommended by your veterinarian to help prevent dental disease. A light or diet meal may be recommended for a heavier dog to maintain a healthy body condition and weight. How To Feed a Parson Jack Russell Terrier The Parson Jack Russell Terrier is a highly energetic breed, but care needs to be taken to ensure that they don\u2019t become overweight. Weight concerns can be addressed by feeding two to three small, measured meals per day. Some terriers may require a light or diet food. Consult your veterinarian on the best way to feed your Jack Russell. How Much Should You Feed a Parson Jack Russell Terrier Just like humans, the recommended caloric intake required varies between individuals due to differences in physical size, metabolism, neuter status, and activity level. The best way to determine the feeding quantity is to talk with your veterinarian, who can calculate caloric needs for the individual. Additionally, the feeding guide labels on your dog food provides valuable information. Nutritional Tips for the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Jack Russel Terriers may benefit from the addition of omega-3 fatty acids into their diets. Omega-3 fatty acids can be found in skin and joint supplements, fish oil, and even in some specially formulated dog foods. These fatty acids act as natural anti-inflammatories that help to support your dog\u2019s skin, coat, kidneys, joints, and heart.
