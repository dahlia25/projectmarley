Learn more about caring for Airedale Terrier puppies and dogs.", "articleBody": "The sturdy Airedale Terrier is the largest terrier breed, earning them the nickname \u201cThe King of Terriers.\u201d The breed originated in England and is likely a cross of a variety of terriers. The result? A hearty dog The Airedale Terrier Club of America (ATCA) calls a \u201cJack of All Trades.\u201d The breed\u2019s history shows their versatility: They\u2019ve been used to hunt, guard, and work with police for decades. The Airedale stands about 23 inches at the shoulder and weighs 40\u201360 pounds. They sport a jaunty beard and have a brown-and-black coat of dense, wiry hair. Caring for an Airedale Terrier The Airedale Terrier is an active and inquisitive breed that needs attention, exercise, and adoration to thrive. While they shed very little, their double-layered wiry coat requires regular grooming and care. Airedales learn quickly, which is a boon and a challenge for training. They\u2019ll pick up new tricks quickly, but this large-breed Terrier can also latch on swiftly to bad habits. Positive reinforcement and lots of patience are needed to teach them good manners\u2014and what is and is not a chew toy. But overall, an Airedale is a great addition to many families who have the time to give them the attention they deserve. Airedale Terrier Health Issues  Airedale Terriers are generally sturdy and healthy pets, though they can suffer from conditions common in dogs, according to the ATCA. The typical life expectancy for the King of Terriers is 10\u201313 years. Hip Dysplasia Airedales can develop hip dysplasia, a hereditary condition where the hip joint develops abnormally, becoming loose and causing pain. Symptoms of hip dysplasia include limping, popping joints, bunny-hopping while running, and abnormal sitting positions. The condition can be treated with medications or with surgery, depending on the severity. The breed club recommends asking your Airedale Terrier breeder about all health screenings, including hip dysplasia, done for your Airedale puppy and parents.\u00a0 Bloat As the largest breed of terrier, Airedales can develop gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), a severe form of bloat in dogs. Dogs can bloat when food or gas causes their stomach to expand, and GDV occurs when the stomach twists on itself and/or the spleen. This dangerous condition can be caused by eating too quickly or exercising immediately after eating. GDV is a life-threatening medical emergency and should be treated immediately. Airedale Terrier pet parents need to be aware of the signs of GDV and bloat, which include: Dry heaving Retching Pacing Stomach distension Collapsing Pale gums\u00a0\u00a0 Hypothyroidism Hypothyroidism occurs when a dog\u2019s thyroid stops producing enough hormone, causing a slowdown in metabolism and other bodily functions. Symptoms of the disease include sluggish behavior, weight gain, chronic skin and ear infections, and hair loss. Though it can\u2019t be cured, hypothyroidism can be treated with lifelong medication and frequent checkups with the veterinarian.\u00a0 What To Feed an Airedale Terrier  Airedales thrive on high-quality, high-protein dog food. Your veterinarian can help you pick a brand approved by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). Airedale Terrier puppies need to eat a good puppy food until they\u2019re about 1 year old, when they can transition to adult food. How To Feed an Airedale Terrier Never allow an Airedale 24/7 access to food, the breed club warns. Free-feeding your dog can allow them to become obese, which can lead to other health issues. Airedale puppies should generally receive three meals a day on a regular schedule, which can be lowered to two daily meals when they reach 1 year old. Because Airedale Terriers are susceptible to bloat, always avoid exercise right before and after mealtimes, and do not feed your dog from a raised bowl. Letting them eat from a slow-feeder bowl can help slow down the scarfing, further reducing the chances of bloat. How Much Should You Feed an Airedale Terrier? The amount of food your Airedale Terrier will need depends on their size, age, and activity level. Use the label on your dog food packaging for guidance, and talk to your veterinarian about how much you should be feeding your pup. Nutritional Tips for Airedale Terriers While dogs get all the nutrients they need from their well-balanced dog food, some Airedale Terriers may benefit from supplements, such as fish oil, to help with dry and itchy skin. Always talk to your vet before giving your dog supplements or adding something new to their diet. Behavior and Training Tips for Airedale Terriers Airedale Terrier Personality and Temperament Airedale Terriers are smart, jolly, and loyal dogs who love to make their pet parents smile with their shenanigans. But all that intelligence and spunk means they should not be left to their own devices for too long. Airedale dogs\u2014and especially Airedale puppies\u2014need exercise and benefit from several walks or games of fetch a day. They can adjust to many living environments, but thrive if they have a fenced yard to run around in. Airedales are more reserved than other terrier breeds, according to the breed club, but they aren\u2019t shy. They make great family dogs and, if trained well, generally get along with children, dogs, and other pets. Airedale Terrier Behavior Airedales are deeply curious dogs who love to investigate anything that catches their attention. Any item that could be potentially interesting\u2014like a newspaper, cardboard box, or bag of chips\u2014should be kept out of an Airedale\u2019s reach when they\u2019re unsupervised. While not particularly anxious or vocal, Airedales are known to dig, so be wary of leaving them in the backyard unattended, the breed club advises. Giving your Airedale Terrier lots of engaging toys and keeping them well-exercised will help deter unwanted behaviors that can arise from boredom. Airedale Terrier Training Because Airedale Terriers are smart puppies, they will not do well with repetitive (and often boring!) training sessions. But this easily bored, super intelligent dog loves to learn\u2014and excel at\u2014obedience drills and new tricks. Like all dog breeds, Airedales do best with positive reinforcement. Vary your training sessions to keep things interesting for them, and give them lots of rewards when they follow your cues. As the ATCA says, \u201cRemember, Airedales are thinkers, not robots.\u201d Fun Activities for Airedale Terriers Agility Hunting Obedience Tracking Fetch Airedale Terrier Grooming Guide  The Airedale Terrier\u2019s hard, wiry exterior coat covers an underlayer of softer, thicker hair. The breed sheds very little, but they need semiregular grooming to keep their stately look. Skin Care Some Airedales\u2019 skin can become dry and/or itchy, according to the ATCA. Pet parents can help their Airedale Terrier remain comfortable by adding supplements to their food as directed by their vet. If a change in diet doesn\u2019t help, take your pup to the vet to check for any medical conditions that might be causing the discomfort.\u00a0 Coat Care\u00a0 Airedale Terriers should go to a professional groomer three or four times a year, according to the breed club. The groomer will help keep the outer coat from looking shaggy while also removing dead hair from their undercoat. At home, a good brushing a few times a week will keep your Airedale\u2019s coat healthy\u2014and make them feel loved. The Airedale\u2019s coat can develop mats, which should be broken apart by hand, then carefully untangled with a comb. If your Airedale dog needs a bath, there\u2019s no need to use a conditioner. Their coat naturally produces oils that will keep it healthy.\u00a0\u00a0 Eye Care Airedale dogs\u2019 eyes should be wiped clean of drainage. Pet parents should also trim long hair around their dog\u2019s eyes that may become dirty or block their vision.\u00a0If you notice anything abnormal about your dog\u2019s eyes, such as discharge, talk to your vet. Ear Care To prevent ear infections and irritation, keep your Airedale\u2019s ears clean and dry. A quick swab with a cotton ball or dog-specific ear cleaner every week should keep ears healthy and happy. Considerations for Pet Parents Raising an Airedale Terrier\u2014especially an Airedale puppy\u2014is a serious time and energy commitment. Prospective terrier parents must be willing to engage in regular training and to exercise their new family member every day. Airedales thrive with a yard to run in and regular outdoor excursions where they can expend energy. Airedales can be great family pets, as long as both children and your new puppy are taught to respect each other."}]
