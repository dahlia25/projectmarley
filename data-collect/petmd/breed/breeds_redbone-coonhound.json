Learn how to care for Redbone Coonhound puppies and dogs here.", "articleBody": "Originating in the United States, the Redbone Coonhound is a dog as versatile as they are resilient. Redbone Coonhounds came into existence in the late 18th century, thanks to hunters in search of a dog capable of navigating various terrains\u2014from the densest swamps to the steepest mountains\u2014in pursuit of prey. And, as the breed\u2019s name suggests, that preferred prey was raccoons. The Redbone Coonhound is a medium to large dog, with adults weighing 45\u201370 pounds and standing 21\u201327 inches tall. While their versatility and hunting prowess make these dogs desirable to many pet parents, the most eye-catching feature of the Redbone Coonhound is by far their stunning, deep red coat. Caring for a Redbone Coonhound Redbone Coonhounds are the epitome of friendliness, loyalty, and\u2014most of all\u2014energy. They are always up for a game and adore outdoor activities with their people, whether it\u2019s going for a long hike or taking a dip at the lake. Their coat is short and smooth, requiring minimal grooming, which makes them a relatively low-maintenance breed. That said, their high energy levels mean Redbone Coonhound pups need regular exercise to stay both physically and mentally stimulated. Redbone Coonhound Health Issues The average Redbone Coonhound lifespan is 12\u201315 years. Although they are generally healthy dogs, they do have a predisposition to certain health conditions. It&#039;s important for potential pet parents to be aware of these conditions and consider pet insurance, which may be a good option. Hip Dysplasia Hip dysplasia is a genetic disorder that commonly affects Redbone Coonhounds. Hip dysplasia develops in dogs when their hip bones do not align properly. This causes irritation in the joint, leading to discomfort, mobility issues, and arthritis. Regular vet check-ups and maintaining a healthy weight can help manage this condition. Joint supplements and pain medication may help alleviate symptoms; however, in severe cases, surgery might be recommended. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) Progressive retinal atrophy, or PRA, refers to inherited eye conditions that gradually result in blindness. While PRA cannot be prevented or treated, a DNA test is available to screen for the defective gene in potential carriers. Regular veterinary check-ups can aid in early detection and managing its progression. If you notice any changes in your dog\u2019s eyes (such as cataracts/cloudiness) or behavior (like suddenly bumping into objects, especially at night), contact your veterinarian for an eye exam.
