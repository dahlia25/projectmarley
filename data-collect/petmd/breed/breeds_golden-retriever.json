Learn more about caring for Golden Retriever puppies and dogs.", "articleBody": "Golden Retrievers are one of the most popular dog breeds in the United States for good reason\u2014they are intelligent, loyal, easy to train, and very affectionate. \u201cGoldens,\u201d as they\u2019re often called, make wonderful family dogs because they are great with young children and other pets when socialized from puppyhood. Golden Retrievers are medium-sized sporting dogs that weigh 55\u201375 pounds, with females weighing on the lower end of this range. Their height can range from 21\u201324 inches tall. They have a broad head, short ears, deep chest, and muscular build.\u00a0 Caring for a Golden Retriever  Golden Retrievers are known for their thick, water-repellent, lustrous golden coats. But their golden fur can range in color, so you can find white Golden Retrievers to red Golden Retrievers. No matter the color, Golden Retrievers have a double coat. This means that they have a thick undercoat of short hair covered by a layer of longer hair. Due to this double coat, Golden Retrievers shed a lot. They also tend to develop matted hair behind their ears and on their hind limbs. So, Golden Retrievers require a lot of grooming\u2014either at home or by a professional groomer\u2014to keep their coats healthy. Goldens have a moderate amount of energy, even in their senior years. They enjoy a wide variety of activities such as running, going on long walks, retrieving, and swimming. They make excellent therapy dogs and guide dogs for people with impaired vision.\u00a0 Golden Retriever Health Issues The average Golden Retriever lifespan is 10\u201312 years, and they\u2019re typically healthy dogs. However, due to poor breeding, some Golden Retrievers may develop a handful of health issues. Make sure to do your research when looking to adopt a Golden Retriever, or find a reputable Golden Retriever breeder so that medical issues are less likely. Hot Spots Due to their thick coats and love for swimming, Golden Retrievers are prone to developing\u00a0hot spots, localized areas of skin that are inflamed and infected, most often with bacteria and/or yeast. Hot spots develop more often in warm, humid environments and after swimming because moisture gets trapped near the skin. This moist skin causes discomfort that leads to scratching, chewing, and licking. These behaviors then cause the normal microbes on the skin to multiply, and the skin becomes inflamed and infected. A hot spot usually develops quickly and can lead to hair loss, redness, and moist skin that may ooze, crust, or develop thick scabs. If you notice any signs of hot spots in your Golden, take them to a veterinarian. Hot spots typically resolve quickly with medication. Atopic Dermatitis (Atopy) Atopic dermatitis (atopy)\u00a0is an inflammatory and extremely itchy skin condition that Golden Retrievers are predisposed to. It can be triggered by environmental allergens (such as insects, fleas, pollen, dust mites, or mold) or by a food allergy, often to the protein in the diet. Goldens are believed to have a genetic predisposition. Symptoms usually develop between 2\u20136 years of age, so regular veterinary visits are important to monitor your dog\u2019s skin health. Golden Retrievers with atopy are constantly scratching, chewing, or licking themselves. This self-trauma leads to hair loss, thickened skin that can be red or black in color, or a rash consisting of macules (discolored skin) or papules (raised skin lesions). Hypothyroidism Hypothyroidism\u00a0is an endocrine disorder that happens when the thyroid gland loses its ability to produce thyroid hormones, leading to symptoms such as: Unexplained weight gain Decreased energy level Recurring skin and ear infections Thinning of the fur Dry, scaly skin Golden Retrievers are predisposed to hypothyroidism and typically develop symptoms when they are middle-aged. Although this endocrine disorder is common, it can be well-managed with lifelong medication. Hip and Elbow Dysplasia Hip dysplasia\u00a0is an inherited orthopedic condition where the hip joint doesn\u2019t properly align. This can cause pain and, over time, arthritis. Hip dysplasia can develop in one or both hip joints. Some Golden Retrievers are born with congenital hip dysplasia\u2014which is rare\u2014while others can develop this condition during their senior years. Symptoms include: Lameness Slowness to rise from a lying position \u201cBunny-hopping\u201d gait when running Reluctance to run, jump, or go up or down stairs Holding the affected leg out to the side when sitting up Reputable Golden Retriever breeders make sure their dogs are screened for this genetic condition, so it\u2019s best to purchase a Golden Retriever puppy from a breeder that has had their dogs certified with a PennHIP evaluation. Hip dysplasia can be managed with\u00a0joint supplements\u00a0and certain medications, but in serious cases,\u00a0surgical intervention\u00a0may be required. Elbow dysplasia\u00a0encompasses several different inherited orthopedic conditions that ultimately lead to\u00a0degenerative joint disease (DJD)\u00a0within the elbow. X-rays or CT scans are used to diagnose elbow dysplasia, and the condition is treated with surgery, joint supplements, and/or anti-inflammatory and pain medications. Eye Conditions Golden Retrievers are prone to a few different eye conditions, including: Pigmentary uveitis: An inherited eye condition where brown or black cysts develop on the eye. They are usually benign and develop when a Golden is at least 5 years old. Treatment usually includes eye or oral medications. Over time, pigmentary uveitis can cause\u00a0cataracts\u00a0and\u00a0glaucoma, which require emergency treatment. Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA): A disease where the eye\u2019s retina slowly degenerates, leading to blindness. There is no cure for PRA, but blind Golden Retrievers can still live long, happy lives with proper care. Cancers Goldens can develop a few types of cancer as well. Some common cancers include: Lymphoma/Lymphosarcoma: A type of cancer that originates in the lymph nodes and typically spreads to other organs. Lymph nodes that commonly enlarge with lymphoma are on the neck, behind the knee, and inside the thigh. There is a relatively high prevalence of this condition within the Golden Retriever breed. Hemangiosarcoma\u00a0(HSA):\u00a0An aggressive form of cancer that most often originates in the spleen, liver, or heart in Golden Retrievers. This type of cancer forms a blood-filled tumor that can rupture at any time and cause a dog to bleed internally. A ruptured tumor can be life-threatening if not treated immediately. Heart Problems Subaortic valvular stenosis (SAS)\u00a0is a genetic heart condition that Golden Retriever puppies inherit from their parents. It develops during the first year of life, so responsible breeding is key to ensuring prevention of this condition. SAS occurs when fibrous tissue slowly forms in the heart and causes an obstruction of blood flow. Over time, this condition causes the heart to stop functioning properly, resulting in heart damage. Golden Retrievers with SAS often have a\u00a0heart murmur\u00a0that can be heard during a routine physical exam, but dogs with mild to moderate SAS may not show any symptoms. However, those with severe SAS are lethargic, tired after short periods of exercise, may collapse, and can die suddenly.\u00a0 What to Feed a Golden Retriever Golden Retriever puppies should be fed a large-breed, high-quality puppy formula until they are 1 year to 18 months old. Once they reach maturity, they will need to be transitioned to a large-breed, high-quality adult. Choosing an\u00a0AAFCO (Association of American Feed Control Officials)-approved food\u00a0is a great place to start, but your veterinarian can help you narrow down your options to find the best food for your Golden Retriever. How to Feed a Golden Retriever Full-grown Golden Retrievers do well with twice-daily feedings, in the morning and evening. Golden Retriever puppies need to eat more frequently\u2014about three or four times each day on a consistent schedule. Golden Retrievers love to eat, so a slow feeder bowl can be a great way to help them slow down their eating and prevent digestion issues. If your dog eats too quickly, it can cause vomiting and possibly\u00a0bloat\u2014an emergency situation where the stomach twists on itself.\u00a0 How Much to Feed a Golden Retriever Golden Retriever puppies have rapid growth spurts, which means it\u2019s important to feed them puppy food when they are less than a year old to provide the extra calories that they need to grow to their full potential. Follow the feeding guidelines on the back of the bag of the large-breed puppy formula, based on their age and expected body weight. Once a Golden Retriever is 1 year old, transition them to a large-breed adult formula that has fewer calories to prevent unwanted weight gain.\u00a0Your veterinarian is your best resource for\u00a0determining how much to feed your Golden Retriever\u00a0to maintain a\u00a0healthy weight. Nutritional Tips for a Golden Retriever Starting a Golden Retriever on a joint supplement early in life can\u00a0help slow down or possibly prevent arthritis. Talk to your vet before giving your pup any supplements like\u00a0Movoflex,\u00a0Synovi Chews,\u00a0Dasuquin,\u00a0Cosequin,\u00a0or\u00a0Flexadin. Another supplement to consider for a Golden Retriever is omega-3 fatty acid (fish oil). This helps to reduce inflammation in the joints, makes the coat more lustrous, and protects the skin barrier from allergens in the environment. Some good fish oil supplements are\u00a0Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Pet,\u00a0Vetoquinol Triglyceride Omega-3 Fatty Acids, and\u00a0Nutramax Welactin Omega 3. Behavior and Training Tips for Golden Retrievers  Golden Retriever Personality and Temperament Golden Retrievers generally have a great temperament\u2014they are often friendly with children, other pets, and even strangers. They enjoy being the center of attention and being petted. In fact, Goldens will often nudge you gently so that you continue to pet them. Golden Retriever Behavior Golden Retrievers have been known to eat things they shouldn\u2019t, especially when they are puppies. They may try to eat socks, shoes, furniture, or get into the trash. To keep your Golden Retriever safe and prevent digestive issues or\u00a0gastrointestinal obstructions, keep a watchful eye on them when they are puppies. Cute Golden Retrievers have a lot of energy and require lots of exercise to be happy and healthy. They are considered a quiet breed, as they bark infrequently and are not known for digging up yards. Golden Retriever Training It is usually easy to train Golden Retrievers due to their kind temperament and their eagerness to please. They are very food-motivated, so using small treats as rewards is highly effective. Socialization is also a very important part of training Golden Retrievers as puppies. Fun Activities for Golden Retrievers Agility Obedience training Tracking Dock diving Bird hunting Fetch Long walks or runs Golden Retriever Grooming Guide Grooming a Golden Retriever is an important part of their care, as these dogs have thick coats and sensitive skin. Their eyes and ears can require special attention, too. Skin Care Regularly checking your Golden Retriever\u2019s skin can help you detect hot spots or other issues that develop. If you notice an increase in scratching, chewing, or licking, talk to your veterinarian. Coat Care Golden Retrievers have a dense double coat, so they shed a lot. It\u2019s important to brush a Golden Retriever at least once or twice every week to prevent matting, especially behind the ears and on the hind limbs. Regular brushing with a FURminator\u00a0brush can also help to\u00a0reduce the amount of shedding\u00a0inside the house. Eye Care Golden Retrievers often have a mild amount of clear or brown eye discharge, which is normal.\u00a0You can use a moistened washcloth or a special eye wipe to clean off any eye discharge. Ear Care Golden Retrievers are prone to\u00a0ear infections\u00a0for several reasons. They have ears that hang down loosely and contain numerous glands that help to produce wax, which can trap moisture and lead to inflammation and infection within the ear canal. Golden Retrievers love water, and if they get any in their ears during swimming or a bath, this can also lead to an ear infection. Because Golden Retrievers can also have allergies or hypothyroidism, ear infections can be a common secondary health issue. To minimize the risk of ear infections in Golden Retrievers, it\u2019s best to\u00a0clean their ears\u00a0with a product that contains a drying agent (like\u00a0EPIOTIC\u00ae Advanced) every two to three weeks for maintenance, plus after swimming or bathing. Considerations for Pet Parents Golden Retrievers make great family dogs due to their jovial and friendly disposition. They can be pretty energetic,\u00a0so pet parents should establish a daily exercise routine with their Golden. It\u2019s also important to train them early about what are and are not appropriate things to eat\u2014this may mean preventing access to things like garbage cans, laundry, and house supplies. However, Golden Retrievers do have a lot of predispositions for illnesses. This means that regular vet visits and additional vet costs will be common while caring for a Golden Retriever. Consider purchasing pet insurance to offset some of the cost of veterinary care. They also have a thick, long coat that is prone to matting, so consistent grooming and brushing are necessary to keep the coat healthy and manage their shedding.\u00a0"}]
