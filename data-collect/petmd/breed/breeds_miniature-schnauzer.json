They need about an hour of exercise a day, but then love to snooze with their humans. Learn more about caring for Miniature Schnauzers.", "articleBody": "The Miniature Schnauzer is descended from an old, hardworking breed of German dogs historically used to pull carts, herd livestock, and hunt rats. Today, the friendly, whip-smart breed makes an excellent and adaptable family pet. The first image of a Schnauzer dog dates back to the late 1400s, according to the American Miniature Schnauzer Club (AMSC). Their long beards gave the breed their name: Schnauze is the German word for muzzle.\u00a0 Miniature Schnauzers are small dogs that are generally between 12\u201314 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh between 10\u201320 pounds. They are the smallest of the three Schnauzer sizes, the other two being the Giant and Standard Schnauzer. Caring for a Miniature Schnauzer Mini Schnauzers are bright and charismatic dogs that can adapt to life in a city apartment as well as on a sprawling farm. They enjoy play as well as a good snooze, but Miniature Schnauzers still need at least an hour of exercise a day, as well as mental stimulation to keep their active minds occupied. They enjoy walks, puzzle games, agility, and learning new tricks. They\u2019re sturdy dogs that, despite their prolific facial hair, don\u2019t shed much. In fact, Miniature Schnauzers can make good pets for some people with dog allergies, though no dog is 100% hypoallergenic. Miniature Schnauzer Health Issues Miniature Schnauzers are generally healthy dogs with a life expectancy of between 12\u201315 years. When purchasing Miniature Schnauzer puppies, the AMSC recommends asking about the health of the puppy\u2019s parents, as this breed can be prone to certain health conditions.\u00a0 Cataracts Cataracts are a condition that creates cloudiness on the lens of the eye, causing reduced vision and sometimes blindness. This is a hereditary condition in Miniature Schnauzers, but cataracts can also be caused by diabetes or trauma. Surgery can remove cataracts and restore vision. High Cholesterol (Hyperlipidemia) A condition called hyperlipidemia can also affect Miniature Schnauzers, according to the breed club. This results in increased levels of fat in the blood and can be caused by endocrine disorders, genetics, obesity, medications, and other health problems, according to the British Small Animal Veterinary Association (BSAVA).\u00a0 Veterinarians use blood tests to diagnose the condition, and treatment\u2014which can include medicine, supplements, or a low-fat and high-fiber diet\u2014depends on the underlying cause.\u00a0 Pancreatitis\u00a0 Miniature Schnauzers are predisposed to pancreatitis. This is when the pancreas has an inflammatory reaction and causes lethargy, abdominal pain, vomiting, dehydration, and loss of appetite. Sometimes pancreatitis can cause collapse and shock, which can be fatal.\u00a0 Treatment depends on severity and primarily consists of supportive care and treating the symptoms. This can be anything from taking antinausea and pain medication at home to days (or even weeks) of IV fluid support while hospitalized.\u202f\u00a0 Liver Shunts Liver shunts describe an abnormal blood flow that bypasses the liver. This is problematic because the liver filters and detoxifies blood, so dogs with liver shunts can experience symptoms such as: Bloody diarrhea Bloody vomit\u00a0 Weight loss Poor appetite Increased thirst and urination Mental dullness\u00a0 Treatment and prognosis depend on whether the shunt is located within or outside the liver.\u00a0 Mycobacterium Avium Complex Rarely, Miniature Schnauzers can inherit Mycobacterium Avium Complex (MAC), a deadly immune disease. The condition was believed to be passed down through a specific family of Miniature Schnauzers, according to the breed club. The disease can be detected through genetic testing, and symptoms include lethargy, lack of appetite, weight loss, weakness, and diarrhea.\u00a0 What To Feed a Miniature Schnauzer Mini Schnauzers, though small, need a well-balanced diet to keep them fueled up for their active lifestyles. They should be fed dog food that\u2019s approved by the Association of American Feed Control Officials and formulated for small dogs. How To Feed a Miniature Schnauzer Adults should be fed twice a day, though Miniature Schnauzer puppies can be fed small, more frequent meals (three or four per day) on a regular schedule.\u00a0 How Much Should You Feed a Miniature Schnauzer? The AMSC recommends feeding a quality kibble with a fat content between 10%\u201315%. Schnauzers, like all dogs, require a health balance of fiber, vitamins, fats, and proteins. Calorie needs depend on your dog\u2019s age, size, and activity level. But don\u2019t let those cute little bearded faces persuade you to feed them more than they need: Overweight Schnauzers are more prone to serious health conditions. \u201cSchnauzers love to eat,\u201d the AMSC states, \u201cand can easily con their owner into overfeeding them at mealtime or with multiple treats all day. Measure amounts, and do not self-feed or free feed.\u201d Nutritional Tips for Miniature Schnauzers Your dog should get all the nutrients he needs in his AAFCO-approved dog food. Your veterinarian can give guidance on whether additional supplements are needed.\u00a0 Behavior and Training Tips for Miniature Schnauzers Miniature Schnauzer Personality and Temperament\u00a0 Mini Schnauzers are smart and spunky dogs who love people. They\u2019re energetic but eager to please their family by following cues and commands. Well-trained Miniature Schnauzers do well with kids and other family pets, making fun playmates. Miniature Schnauzers can make good pets for some people with dog allergies, though no dog is 100% hypoallergenic.Because Schnauzers of all sizes come from a working-dog heritage, many enjoy having a job to do. Try enrolling your Miniature Schnauzer in dog sport classes, such as agility or obedience competitions, so he can give his body (and brain!) a workout. Miniature Schnauzer Behavior Mini Schnauzers are alert dogs, which means they can be especially vocal and bark at neighbors, delivery people, and neighborhood squirrels.\u00a0 Speaking of barking at neighborhood animals, spunky Miniature Schnauzers can sometimes think they\u2019re much bigger than they actually are. Their history as rat-catching dogs means some are more prone to chasing anything that moves, which can easily get them into trouble. Mini Schnauzers should always be kept on a leash or within a fenced-in yard when they\u2019re outside to prevent them from darting off.\u00a0 Miniature Schnauzer Training Schnauzers love to please their people and are amenable to many types of training. Once your Miniature Schnauzer puppy masters the basics of \u201csit\u201d and \u201cstay,\u201d try teaching him more involved tricks or how to run an agility course. As long as you use positive reinforcement and keep sessions fun, your Schnauzer dog will love the challenge.\u00a0 Fun Activities for Miniature Schnauzer Agility Obedience competitions Lure chasing Barn hunt Miniature Schnauzer Grooming Guide  To maintain a Miniature Schnauzer\u2019s well-coiffed look, the breed\u2019s wiry, medium-length coat requires a lot of grooming, both by their pet parents and a professional. Skin Care Miniature Schnauzers don\u2019t require any specific skin care, though owners should keep an eye out for dry skin, abrasions, or other abnormalities. Talk to your veterinarian if you notice anything concerning about your Schnauzer\u2019s skin. Coat Care Schnauzers have a double coat\u2014a wiry top layer on top of a softer undercoat. They require regular trims to keep their hair healthy and their mustache tidy. Miniature Schnauzers should see a professional groomer at least once every eight weeks.\u00a0 Brushing your Schnauzer at least once a week also helps reduce tangles and mats. The Schnauzer\u2019s signature beard may need more upkeep than the rest of his body, as it may become discolored from eating or playing. Eye Care Pet parents need to pay special attention to the hair around their Miniature Schnauzer\u2019s eyes, as it can block the dog\u2019s vision. Keeping their hair trimmed will help.\u00a0 Ear Care Miniature Schnauzers aren\u2019t prone to ear infections. However, pet parents need to clean their pup\u2019s ears with a dog-specific ear cleaner every time their dog is in water, such as after a bath or a swim. Otherwise, moisture can become trapped in their canals and cause an infection.\u00a0 Considerations for Pet Parents Mini Schnauzers crave the attention and presence of their family, according to the AMSC, and shouldn\u2019t be left alone to entertain themselves all day. Prospective Schnauzer pet parents need to have enough time to spend with their new friend. \u201cThey need to live as a part of their family, going where they go, doing what they do,\u201d according to the AMSC.\u00a0 As long as you have time to devote to them, Schnauzers are affable and adaptable, making them good pets for many types of families. As long as they are given enough exercise and attention, they make a wonderful and charming addition to any household.\u00a0 Mini Schnauzers crave the attention and presence of their family and shouldn\u2019t be left alone to entertain themselves all day."}]
