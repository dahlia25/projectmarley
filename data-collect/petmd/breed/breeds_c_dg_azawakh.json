All from the real vets at PetMD.", "articleBody": "By Paula Fitzsimmons With its long legs, lean build and large, expressive eyes, the Azawakh was officially recognized as a new dog breed in the AKC\u2019s hound group in January 2019. The Azawakh is originally from West Africa, where these pups have traditionally served as hunters, guardians and herders. The Azawakh dog breed made its way to the US in the 1980s. The Azawakh is a fast, energetic and independent dog breed cherished for deep devotion and affection for their human families. Those most familiar with the Azawakh say they\u2019re a complex breed who requires early training and socialization in order to evolve into well-balanced dogs. Physical Characteristics The Azawakh is a tall, medium-size\u00a0dog breed with a slender build and noticeably long legs. At first glance, they resemble Greyhounds; however, they are more closely related to Sloughi and Salukis, who are also members of the hound group. Azawakh males stand between 25 and 29 inches tall, with females typically a couple inches shorter. Males weigh from 44 to 55 pounds; females from 33 to 44 pounds. These dogs are built for speed, a skill useful for hunting fast-moving animals like rabbits and gazelle in their native West\u00a0Africa. \u201cThe gait is light, and they appear to float over the ground,\u201d says Deb Kidwell, secretary of the American Azawakh Association. \u201cThe gallop is leaping, similar to a deer. It\u2019s not particularly fast as compared to a Greyhound, but they have incredible endurance.\u201d Experts describe the Azawakh as elegant and exotic. \u201cThe tail is long, thin and tapered; it is set low but carried above the level of the back when the dog is excited. The head is long, narrow, lean and chiseled with a long, straight muzzle. The eyes are large and almond-shaped. The ears are high-set and triangular with slightly rounded tips,\u201d says Gina DiNardo, executive secretary of the American Kennel Club (AKC) in New York City. The Azawakh also has a deep chest and prominent hip bones, as well as bones and muscles that are visible beneath their thin skin, she adds. Their coat is short and \u201cmay be down to nonexistent on the belly,\u201d says Kidwell. The AKC standard allows all colors, color combinations and markings; limiting genetic diversity can actually be detrimental to this breed, Kidwell says. Common Azawakh colors include red, brown, black, gray and white. Personality and Temperament The Azawakh dog breed is known to be highly affectionate and loyal. \u201cIn terms of the bond with the owner, there is nothing like it. The Azawakh\u2019s devotion to their owner or family is legendary,\u201d says Kidwell. This affection is reserved for family members, however. \u201cGenerally, [Azawakh] tend to be aloof or avoidant with strangers. Early and consistent socialization is important to have a well-rounded pet. Some may never accept a stranger\u2019s touch or close presence.\u201d They also have a high level of energy and endurance. \u201cA bored Azawakh is not a good thing! The owner of an Azawakh needs to be dedicated to providing adequate exercise and interaction for the breed. They are settled house dogs once their exercise needs have been met,\u201d says Kidwell. They\u2019re a complex, intelligent breed and are not suited for everyone. \u201cThey aren\u2019t the easiest breed to live with when you don\u2019t understand their basic emotional need to be close with their person and to be a beloved and cherished family member,\u201d says Kidwell, who lives with five Azawakhs. Doing research and speaking at length to a vetted breeder is essential before committing oneself to the breed. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to become enamored with the exotic beauty of the Azawakh. However, you must examine yourself as to your suitability to be an Azawakh owner with all the pros and cons of living with the breed,\u201d Kidwell says. Care Because they\u2019re a highly intelligent and independent dog breed, Azawakh need to be trained as pups, says DiNardo. \u201cEarly socialization and puppy training classes with a trainer who has a positive approach are recommended. The Azawakh possesses an amazing amount of dignity,&quot; says DiNardo, and like any dog, &quot;does not respond well to harsh or punishment-based training, which can ultimately produce a hound who is either broken in spirit, aggressive or unmanageable.\u201d \u201cPositive, reward-based training with gentle but firm corrections can result in a hound who is obedient, affectionate and loyal,\u201d says DiNardo. They are highly energetic and rugged dogs who require regular exercise, which includes \u201clong walks, daily opportunities to run in securely fence[d] areas and daily activities with their owners. Without regular exercise, they can become lethargic or can exhibit destructive behavior,\u201d says DiNardo. Exercise needs to be interactive, Kidwell says. \u201cLeaving an Azawakh alone in a yard expecting them to exercise themselves without a playmate or interaction of owner is certainly not ideal.\u201d Kidwell has a large yard for her Azawakh to play, run and exercise, but she says they also need to go places to maintain their socialization skills. \u201cGroup walks with other dog lovers at the local park are great.\u201d Kidwell also recommends giving your dog a ride in the car, even if it is just going on errands. \u201cThese things help your Azawakh to become well-adjusted and keeps them happy,\u201d she says. Some Azawakh prefer to stay home, however. \u201cThese dogs would like to live in a vacuum with their family. It\u2019s the conundrum of living with this breed,\u201d Kidwell says. These native West African pups also tolerate heat well, says DiNardo, \u201cbut are sensitive to damp and cold weather, which should be considered when planning an exercise schedule.\u201d What they don\u2019t tolerate well is long hours in dog crates. \u201cIf you are working an eight- to 10-hour day, a dog walker or doggy day care would be a good alternative. [An] Azawakh kept crated for long periods of time will become neurotic, and may become a crate soiler or hurt himself trying to escape the confinement.\u201d The Azawakh has a fine coat, so upkeep is minimal, says DiNardo. \u201cA weekly once-over with a soft bristle brush, a rubber grooming mitt or tool, or a hound glove is usually what is needed to keep the coat in good condition.\u201d Health Overall, the Azawakh is considered a healthy dog breed that, with optimal care, can live between 10 and 13 years old. The most common health problems they experience are hypothyroidism, seizures, masticatory myositis (a condition that makes it extremely painful for a dog to open his mouth) and a spinal condition called spondylosis, says Kidwell. \u201cHip dysplasia and bloat are virtually unknown in the breed but could happen.\u201d Experts strongly recommend working with a breeder who tests her Azawakh before breeding them. \u201cSome tests that are recommended are CBC and Super Chem blood tests, full thyroid profile, X-ray for hip and elbow dysplasia, heart and eye testing,\u201d says Kidwell. Kidwell recommends waiting until they\u2019re fully mature before breeding them. \u201cIt would hopefully show that seizures are not present, though some get seizures later in life.\u201d She says Azawakh should also receive DNA testing before breeding. \u201cKeeping the coefficient of inbreeding\u2014a method of determining how closely related two dogs are\u2014of the breeding pair low also helps genetic diversity and prevents excessive inbreeding.\u201d History and Background Azawakh are sighthounds who descended from the free-roaming dogs of the Saharan Sahel region of West Africa, says DiNardo. \u201cThe breed takes its name from the area\u2019s Azawakh Valley.\u201d \u00a0 The Azawakh is the only sighthound dog breed that is indigenous to this area, says Kidwell. \u201cIn the Sahel, they are a multipurpose hound.\u201d They are most commonly used as a village and flock guard, as well as a hunter of game\u2014like rabbits, gazelle and jackal. Azawakh are also used for herding flocks of sheep, goats and zebu cattle, explains Kidwell. They\u2019re still used in these capacities in countries within Africa today. They are considered more than workers; DiNardo explains that they are prized family members that live under the same roof as their owners."}]
