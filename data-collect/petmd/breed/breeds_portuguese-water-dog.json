Learn more about caring for Portuguese Water Dog puppies and what makes them a great family pet.", "articleBody": "Spirited, athletic, and intelligent, the Portuguese Water Dog is an excellent swimmer and seafarer bred to be a fisherman\u2019s helper on Portugal\u2019s coasts. They are beloved for their affectionate natures, minimal shedding, and adorable teddy bear-like faces\u2014so much so that they even reached celebrity status: Sunny and the late Bo Obama, who both lived with the first family in the White House, may be the most famous Portuguese Water Dogs in U.S. history.\u00a0 But Portuguese Water Dogs, which can grow to be up to 23 inches tall and weigh between 35-60 pounds, are popular additions to households all over the U.S. Due to their energetic demeanors, the fluffy and friendly water dog breed is best for active pet parents. Caring for a Portuguese Water Dog The jolly, affectionate Portuguese Water Dog can be a doting family pet if given the proper amount of exercise, training, and attention starting at an early age. They are also wired to work, according to the Portuguese Water Dog Club of America (PWDCA): The canines were bred from the 13th century to perform duties such as retrieving fishing gear and preventing fish from escaping nets along the coast of Portugal. That means pet parents should be prepared to provide their energetic Portuguese Water Dog with plenty of attention and exercise (at least 30-60 minutes per day). Those who do will be rewarded with loyalty, plenty of snuggles, and affection. Their robust, medium-size bodies are blessed with low-shedding coats, but their curly or wavy locks require regular grooming and care. \u201cThey are just happy-go-lucky, nice dogs,\u201d says Pam Nichols, DVM, CCRP, CFI, immediate past president of the American Animal Hospital Association. Portuguese Water Dog Health Issues While they are predisposed to a few conditions, \u201chealth issues with Portuguese Water Dogs tend to be relatively low,\u201d Nichols says.\u00a0 Hypothyroidism Hypothyroidism is a condition in dogs characterized by the decreased production of hormones in the thyroid gland. Like in humans, this gland serves an important function in dogs\u2019 metabolism. If the organs aren\u2019t producing enough hormones, body functions slow, resulting in symptoms such as weight gain, lethargy, chronic skin and ear infections, heat-seeking behaviors, and an unhealthy coat.\u00a0 If left untreated, hypothyroidism can shorten your Portuguese Water Dog\u2019s lifespan. But thankfully, the condition can be treated with a lifelong oral medication and routine monitoring by your veterinarian. Hip Dysplasia\u00a0 Hip dysplasia is a condition characterized by an unstable fit of the hip\u2019s ball and socket. Pups with hip dysplasia commonly display reduced activity and limited mobility. There are many options for treating hip dysplasia, including nutrition supplements (such as Glucosamine with MSM), anti-inflammatory medications, and, in severe cases, surgery.\u00a0If left untreated, arthritis can develop. Addison\u2019s Disease According to the PWDCA, Portuguese Water Dogs are one of about a dozen breeds that are predisposed to Addison\u2019s disease, a dysfunction of the adrenal glands. The glands, located near the kidneys, produce corticosteroid hormones that affect dogs\u2019 ability to manage stress and metabolism. With Addison\u2019s disease, there is a decrease or total lack of these hormones being produced. Pups with the disease may show symptoms such as: Lethargy Decreased appetite Vomiting Diarrhea The disease is treatable and, if caught early, affected patients can live normal, active lives. Congenital Eye Issues Portuguese Water Dogs can develop progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) or cataracts, according to the PWDCA. PRA is a disorder that causes deterioration of the retina, a light-sensitive layer of cells in the eye, and can gradually lead to blindness. While it isn\u2019t painful, symptoms include night blindness, dilated pupils, and clumsiness. There is no treatment for PRA, but it can take months or even years for the disease to fully impair a dog\u2019s eyesight. Cataracts involve cloudiness in the eyes, which can eventually lead to vision loss. If you notice your pup\u2019s lenses have a cloudy or opaque appearance or that his vision has become limited, consult a veterinarian. The issue can be treated with surgery, but it will lead to blindness if untreated. What To Feed a Portuguese Water Dog To help your Portuguese Water Dog maintain a healthy weight, avoid health problems, and be his happiest and most energetic, he must consume the proper type and amount of dog food approved by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). How To Feed a Portuguese Water Dog\u00a0 Nichols recommends choosing a high-quality dog food brand (such as Hill\u2019s Science Diet, Iams, Eukanuba, Royal Canin, or Purina Pro Plan) that is appropriate for your dog\u2019s life stage. Portuguese Water Dog puppies should be fed on a regular schedule three times per day, while adults can be fed once in the morning and once at night. How Much Should You Feed a Portuguese Water Dog? To determine the quantity of food to give your Portuguese Water Dog, talk to your veterinarian. They will assess your pup\u2019s age, activity level, and other factors to determine how many calories your dog needs to consume daily. The correct meal size will depend on factors including the type of food, number of meals, and life stage. Nutritional Tips for Portuguese Water Dogs Portuguese Water Dogs fed a complete and balanced diet shouldn\u2019t need nutritional supplements unless a veterinarian recommends them. Essential nutrients in dog food include protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and fat, the right combination of which will help your four-legged friend look and feel his best. Behavior and Training Tips for Portuguese Water Dogs Portuguese Water Dog Personality and Temperament\u00a0 Portuguese Water Dogs are intelligent and loyal companions that make wonderful additions to families of all sizes\u2014though they require proper training, socialization, and exercise to manage their high energy levels and curious natures. \u201cA Portuguese Water Dog can make a great family pet that can be around children and other animals,\u201d says Christos Philippou, owner and trainer at Delaware K9 Academy. \u201cHowever, proper introductions are a must to keep everybody in the household safe.\u201d Since these water-loving dogs were bred to be the right-hand pups of Portuguese fishermen, they love to work and learn new things. They need jobs\u2014whether that\u2019s learning new tricks, agility training, or fetching balls and Frisbees\u2014to keep them happy. Athletic and clever, Portuguese Water Dogs are ideal for households that enjoy exercise and outdoor activities like hiking, walking, jogging, and swimming.\u00a0 Portuguese Water Dog Behavior\u00a0 While the pups aren\u2019t known to be huge barkers, Portuguese Water Dogs will speak up when prompted\u2014for example, by squirrels in the yard or visitors at your doorstep. However, the activity-relishing Portuguese Water Dog can turn to undesirable behaviors like excessive barking and chewing if he doesn\u2019t receive the right amount of mental stimulation and exercise. \u201cThese dogs love to run and do not tire easily,\u201d Philippou says. \u201cThey will certainly need a daily walk paired with mental stimulation and obedience training to reduce nuisance behaviors and to ensure their needs are being met.\u201d Pet parents can keep their four-legged friends busy by setting up agility or obstacle courses in their backyard, taking their pups for a swim, and investing in a variety of puzzle toys. Portuguese Water Dog Training\u00a0 The Portuguese Water Dogs are known for their high intelligence and easy-to-train nature\u2014which is why they\u2019ve been helpful companions for centuries. Positive reinforcement, a training method that involves using praise and treats to reward good behaviors, should be started as early in your dog\u2019s life as possible. \u201cPositive reinforcement training is a great option for the Portuguese Water Dog, as they can often be highly food motivated,\u201d Philippou says. \u201cRewarding the good behaviors is an excellent way to communicate with your dog and mark good behaviors that you want to continue.\u201d In addition to excelling at obedience and agility training, the breed has a gentle temperament that is ideal for therapy and service dog training. Fun Activities for Portuguese Water Dogs\u00a0 Walking or running Hiking Fetch Swimming Dock diving Dog park Tug-of-war Chase Agility training Obedience training Puzzle games Portuguese Water Dog Grooming Guide The Portuguese Water Dog\u2019s eye-catching coats can be either wavy or curly, both of which are low-shedding and require regular grooming and brushing. To keep their beautiful hair from becoming unruly, Nichols recommends a visit to the groomer every 4-6 weeks. \u201cThey don\u2019t shed much and have a constantly growing hair coat,\u201d she says. \u201cThat also means their coat will mat if left alone, so get a good groomer and get a good schedule going.\u201d\u00a0 Nichols also urges pet parents to brush their Portuguese Water Dog\u2019s teeth daily, which can help prevent expensive anesthesia-induced cleanings later in life. Skin Care If your adventure-loving friend gets wet or dirty from being outside, give him a bath with a dog-specific shampoo. But otherwise, Portuguese Water Dogs don\u2019t require a regular bathing routine.\u00a0 Coat Care\u00a0 Because the Portuguese Water Dog has such voluminous curls and waves, they are prone to matting and require regular visits to the groomer. Pet parents will also need to brush their dog a few times a week.\u00a0 Eye Care Because congenital eye conditions such as PRA and cataracts are common in Portuguese Water Dogs, pet parents should look for symptoms such as impaired night vision, clumsiness, and dilated pupils. Ear Care Portuguese Water Dogs are not prone to ear infections, but they can benefit from ear cleanings, especially if they love to swim. Considerations for Pet Parents Loving and loyal Portuguese Water Dogs make wonderful additions to active households of all sizes. But they must be supplied with the right amount of daily mental and physical stimulation, which can encompass everything from trail running to a romp in the yard. They can thrive in smaller quarters like apartments if their needs are met, but Portuguese Water Dogs will ultimately be happiest with plenty of room to roam in a fenced-in yard. Pet parents should also plan on using positive reinforcement training starting at a young age and budgeting for regular visits to the groomer."}]
