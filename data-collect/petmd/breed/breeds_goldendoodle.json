Learn about caring for Standard and Mini Goldendoodles.", "articleBody": "First bred in the late 1960s as guide dogs, the Goldendoodle\u2014a crossbreed of a Golden Retriever and a Poodle\u2014became a popular household pet in the United States during the 1990s. Since then, the dogs have been coveted companions that are beloved for having low-shedding qualities, a clever-yet-highly-trainable personality, and a patient family-friendly nature.\u202f\u00a0\u00a0 The standard large-size, wavy-haired Goldendoodle can grow to 20\u201324 inches tall and about 50\u201390 pounds, but also come in smaller sizes as Mini Goldendoodles. It all depends on which Poodle parent they have\u2014the Standard Poodle or the Miniature Poodle.\u202f\u00a0 Caring for a Goldendoodle  The Goldendoodle is bred to exhibit the best qualities of both the Golden Retriever and the Poodle. The result is a smart, fun-loving pup that\u2019s a wonderful addition to any size household, if given the proper amount of exercise to satisfy her high energy level and training from a young age.\u202f\u00a0 Goldendoodles are very intelligent and do well in obedience classes and agility training. While they can live happily with other dogs, cats, and children, the pups can be prone to separation anxiety. That\u2019s why pet parents should ensure their Doodle gets plenty of social activity every day and avoid leaving them alone at home for long periods of time (more than eight hours). Goldendoodle Health Issues Goldendoodles are generally healthy dogs that can live 10\u201315 years, but they are prone to common health conditions of the Poodle and Golden Retriever breeds.\u202f\u00a0\u00a0 While you can\u2019t ensure your Goldendoodle will be free of health problems, you can purchase your puppy from a reputable breeder, says Jamie Whittenburg, DVM. \u201cBreeders should be thoroughly testing their breeding stock by performing OFA or PennHip testing on their hips, echocardiograms with a cardiologist, and extensive genetic testing, prior to breeding.\u201d\u00a0 Hip Dysplasia\u202f\u00a0 Hip dysplasia is a common issue for large- and giant-breed dogs and happens when the hip joint develops abnormally, resulting in a loose joint. It can happen during a Goldendoodle puppy\u2019s growing phase.\u00a0 \u202fDiscomfort is commonly displayed by pups via limited mobility, which can include reduced activity, difficulty going up stairs, or even difficulty just getting up. There are many options for treating hip dysplasia, from nutrition supplements to anti-inflammatory medications to surgery, but it\u2019s vital to consult your vet to find the best treatment for your Goldendoodle.\u00a0 Heart Disease\u202f\u00a0 Goldendoodles are genetically predisposed to heart disease, particularly a congenital variation called subvalvular aortic stenosis (SAS). This is when the heart\u2019s aortic valve narrows, creating an obstruction. The heart must work harder than normal to pump blood through this narrowed area, causing heart muscle abnormalities, says Whittenburg.\u202f\u201cThere are no foods, or things to avoid, that will prevent an inherited heart defect,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, it is important to not add to the issue by feeding a food that has been linked to heart disease. Grain-free and boutique brand foods should be avoided.\u201d\u00a0 Congenital Eye Issues\u00a0 Goldendoodles are susceptible to two eye conditions: glaucoma and cataracts. Glaucoma is an eye disease involving increased pressure. Symptoms pet parents should look out for include bulging eyeballs, watery discharge, redness to the whites of the eyes,\u00a0and dilated pupils. The condition can be treated with long-term medication. If left untreated, glaucoma can lead to blindness.\u202f\u00a0\u202f\u00a0 Cataracts is a common condition in dogs that causes clouding in the eyes and can lead to vision loss. If you notice that one or both of your Goldendoodle\u2019s eye lenses has a cloudy or opaque appearance, or that their vision has become more limited, consult a veterinary professional. Cataracts can be treated with surgery but, left untreated, can lead to complete loss of vision.\u00a0 What To Feed a Goldendoodle  A balanced diet will help your Goldendoodle maintain a healthy weight and avoid obesity-related health conditions. That means ensuring your pup eats the proper amount of high-quality dog food and always has access to fresh water.\u202f\u00a0 First bred in the late 1960s as guide dogs, the Goldendoodle\u2014a crossbreed of a Golden Retriever and a Poodle\u2014became a popular household pet in the United States during the 1990s.How To Feed a Goldendoodle\u00a0 Goldendoodles are part Golden Retriever, a breed prone to heart disease. To help reduce the risks of heart disease, avoid feeding your dog grain-free and boutique brand foods, Whittenburg says. Instead, pet parents should look for Association of American Feed Control Officials\u2013compliant dog foods, such as Purina\u00ae Pro Plan, Hill\u2019s Science Diet, and Royal Canin.\u202f\u00a0 \u201cThese dogs should always be fed smaller amounts, at least twice daily, and not allowed to [inhale] their food or to exercise for up to an hour after eating,\u201d she says. \u201cThese measures will reduce the likelihood of life-threatening gastric dilatation and volvulus, or GDV.\u201d\u00a0\u202f\u00a0 How Much Should You Feed a Goldendoodle?\u202f\u00a0 To determine the appropriate amount of food to give your Goldendoodle, chat with your veterinarian, who will assess your pup\u2019s lifestyle, health, reproductive status, allergies, and breed to determine how many kilocalories your dog should consume daily.\u202f\u00a0 \u201cTake the food, or a picture of the nutrition label, to the vet with you and they will calculate the amount of that food that you should be feeding,\u201d Whittenburg says. \u201cIf you are preparing a homemade diet, the veterinary nutritionist will calculate this for you.\u201d\u00a0 Generally, Goldendoodle puppies under 6 months old should be fed a minimum of three times a day and adult dogs should be fed twice a day, depending on their stage of life (adolescent versus senior age). \u201cWhile adults can technically be fed once a day, this can lead to anxiety and hyperfixation on meals,\u201d Whittenburg says. \u201cIt is better for the dog\u2019s metabolism and mental health to be fed every 12 hours.\u201d\u00a0 Nutritional Tips for Goldendoodles\u202f\u00a0 Excess protein and calories are not necessary for pet dogs, even active ones such as Goldendoodles, and may lead to obesity and kidney issues, says Whittenburg. Treats should make up only 10% of your dog\u2019s calorie intake and never replace a diet.\u202f\u00a0 Unless recommended by a veterinarian, dogs fed a complete and balanced commercial food diet should not need any nutritional supplements, which means it\u2019s important to pick a food\u00a0catered to your Goldendoodle\u2019s life stage, whether she\u2019s a puppy, adult, or senior.\u202f Behavior and Training Tips for Goldendoodles  Goldendoodle Personality and Temperament\u00a0 If socialized properly as puppies, Goldendoodles can certainly live in homes with other canines. \u201cThey are also generally good around cats and children, although there may be some initial adjustment period as they get used to new family members,\u201d says Sophie Whoriskey, DVM.\u00a0\u00a0 Goldendoodles are energetic dogs that require 30\u201360 minutes of physical exercise per day, which can encompass a combination of everything from walks and runs to hikes and playtime.\u00a0\u202f\u00a0 Goldendoodle Behavior\u202f\u00a0 Because Goldendoodles cherish time spent with their family, they are prone to separation anxiety if they don\u2019t receive the proper amount of social stimulation. Pet parents should avoid leaving their four-legged friends at home alone for too long.\u202f\u00a0 Goldendoodles are energetic dogs that require 30\u201360 minutes of physical exercise per day.While these laid-back canines aren\u2019t big barkers, they can become vocal to alert their humans. Overall, Goldendoodles are known for their gentle temperament, making them ideal for households with kids and elders. \u201cThey especially benefit from having a strong bond with their human family and being part of the daily routine,\u201d Whoriskey says.\u202f\u00a0\u202f\u00a0 Goldendoodle Training\u00a0 Goldendoodles are known for being intelligent and easily trained, so they excel in activities like agility and obedience classes. They respond well to positive reinforcement techniques, using treats to reward good behavior.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s also important to train Goldendoodle puppies at a very young age to ensure they develop good habits that will last throughout their lifetime and minimize mischievous behavior. \u201cWith patience and consistency, you will be able to teach your Goldendoodle many tricks and commands,\u201d Whoriskey says.\u00a0 But Mindy Waite, CAAB, CPDT-KA warns pet parents not to be outsmarted by their Goldendoodle\u2019s cleverness. \u201cThey are so smart that they easily train their [pet parents] to suit their own purposes,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause of how easy they are to train, they respond well to positive-reinforcement training methods, although [pet parents] need to be careful that they are not manipulated by their highly intelligent dogs.\u201d\u00a0 Fun Activities for Goldendoodles\u00a0 Walking or running\u00a0 Hiking\u00a0 Frisbee Swimming\u00a0 Dock diving\u00a0 Hunting\u00a0 Dog park\u00a0 Tug-of-war\u00a0 Chase\u00a0 Agility training\u00a0 Cuddle time\u00a0 Goldendoodle Grooming Guide  Because they\u2019re a mix of Golden Retriever and Poodle, Goldendoodles are known for their beautiful curly coat that sheds minimally. But Goldendoodle pups require a high-maintenance hair care routine, including regular brushing and appointments with a professional groomer.\u00a0 Skin Care\u202f\u00a0 While Goldendoodles don\u2019t require a regular bathing routine, your dog may benefit from a splash in the shower or tub if they get wet or dirty from adventures outside.\u202f\u00a0 Coat Care\u00a0 To avoid unruly tangles and matting, Goldendoodles need constant and regular grooming. Regular brushing at home is also a must. \u201cTraining these dogs from a young age to allow for this consistent grooming is absolutely critical,\u201d Waite says. \u201cIn addition, [pet parents] must be prepared to spend a good deal of money on grooming every four to eight weeks.\u201d\u00a0 Eye Care\u202f\u00a0 Trim your pup\u2019s bangs to ensure their voluminous locks don\u2019t block their vision. Because Goldendoodles are prone to congenital eye conditions such as glaucoma and cataracts, pet parents should also keep an eye on respective symptoms and contact their veterinarian if needed.\u00a0\u202f\u00a0 Ear Care\u202f\u00a0 To prevent infections in your Goldendoodle\u2019s ears, always keep them clean and dry, especially after a bath or a swim.\u00a0 Considerations for Pet Parents\u202f\u00a0 The Goldendoodle is a friendly, bouncy, high-energy breed that comes in many sizes, making them an ideal companion for any household. They can live in any type of home but prefer one with a yard and plenty of room to roam.\u202f\u00a0\u00a0 Because Goldendoodles don\u2019t shed much, they are considered a preferred breed for people with allergies and are commonly referred to as \u201chypoallergenic\u201d dogs\u2014though no dog breed is 100% allergen-free.When bringing home a Goldendoodle puppy, be prepared to provide your pup with proper positive-reinforcement training and attention to ensure she doesn\u2019t become easily excitable, mouthy, and prone to frustration. Goldendoodles require ample amounts of training and exercise every day, particularly in their early puppy years, to stay entertained, tired, and happy, Waite says.\u202f\u00a0"}]
