The Cairn is a small working breed that historically hunted vermin on farmland, according to the Cairn Terrier Club of America (CTCA). Though a tenacious worker, these dogs weigh only 13\u201314 pounds and stand about 10 inches tall. Today, you can find this friendly, confident dog breed across the U.S., where they are as happy in an apartment or suburban house as they are on a farm. Caring for a Cairn Terrier  Cairn Terriers are a courageous breed. Because of their small size and adaptability, they can thrive almost anywhere, whether in a little apartment or on vast acreage like their Scottish ancestors. But, as with all other dogs, pet parents have to stay on top of their Cairn Terrier\u2019s needs to keep them happy and healthy. One important part of care is grooming. While you don\u2019t need to take regular trips to the groomer, consistently brushing your Cairn Terrier is essential for keeping this breed looking their best and preventing matting.\u00a0They also need lots of exercise and mental stimulation or they can turn to unwanted behaviors (like digging up your backyard) to entertain themselves. Consistent training is vital from the time your Cairn Terrier is a puppy so they can grow up to have good manners. Cairn Terrier Health Issues  Cairn Terriers are a primarily healthy breed with a long lifespan of 13\u201315 years. But according to the Foundation of the Cairn Terrier Club of America, there are several health conditions the breed is susceptible to. \u00a0 Eye Problems Cairn Terriers can develop cataracts, a condition where the eye lens becomes cloudy. While this typically develops later in life as a dog ages, Cairn Terriers can also develop juvenile cataracts when they are young. The condition leads to blindness, but cataracts can be corrected with surgery. The breed can also develop progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), another eye condition that leads to complete blindness. However, unlike with cataracts, there is no treatment for PRA. Signs of vision loss in dogs are: Confusion Bumping into things Anxiety Not willing to go up or down stairs Not willing to jump If you notice any of these signs, have your dog examined by their veterinarian as soon as possible. Cushing\u2019s Disease Cushing\u2019s disease is when a dog\u2019s adrenal glands secrete too much of the stress hormone cortisol. If you notice your dog drinking a lot more water, urinating more frequently, losing hair, developing a pot-bellied appearance, developing recurring skin infections, or acting more lethargic, talk to your veterinarian. Treatment can involve surgery, radiation, or lifelong medications. Hypothyroidism Cairn Terriers are predisposed to hypothyroidism, a disease that results in decreased production of thyroid hormone. Symptoms can include weight gain, chronic skin or ear infections, lethargy, intolerance to cold, and a thinning coat. If you notice any of these signs, schedule a checkup with your veterinarian. Liver Shunts Liver shunts may occur in your Cairn Terrier and are characterized by abnormal blood flow that bypasses the liver. This prevents the liver from filtering toxins from the blood, resulting in symptoms such as weight loss, poor growth, increased thirst and urination, vomiting, diarrhea, and behavioral changes such as unsteadiness. This can occur as an inherited condition in a Cairn Terrier puppy or acquired when they\u2019re older. Patellar Luxation Patellar luxation \u200b\u200bis a disorder where your dog\u2019s kneecap slips out of place. The main symptom of a luxating patella is your dog kicking their back legs behind them and bunny-hopping around. Sometimes the condition corrects itself, but severe cases may require surgery, as this condition can be painful and will lead to arthritis. Talk to your vet about joint supplements that are beneficial for dogs with patellar luxation. What To Feed a Cairn Terrier  Feeding Cairn Terrier puppies, adults, and seniors a healthy and balanced diet is vital. When choosing the best dog food for your Cairn Terrier, select a brand whose nutritional guidelines are approved by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). This will support their active lifestyle, ensure that their digestive system stays healthy, and help their teeth remain strong.\u00a0 How To Feed a Cairn Terrier Cairn Terrier puppies should be fed three times a day on a regular schedule. Once they reach adulthood, you can scale back their mealtimes to twice a day. Be sure to always keep fresh water readily available, especially during mealtime. How Much Should You Feed a Cairn Terrier? Cairn Terriers can quickly become overweight, so it\u2019s important to measure out each meal. Follow the guidance on your dog food packaging for specific portion sizes and talk to your veterinarian about how much your Cairn eats. Your vet can make adjustments based on your dog\u2019s lifestyle, current weight, and health history. Nutritional Tips for Cairn Terriers Most dogs get all the nutrients they need from their well-balanced dog food. Depending on your dog\u2019s health, your vet may recommend nutritional supplements. Never begin giving your dog supplements without talking to the vet first. Behavior and Training Tips for Cairn Terriers  Cairn Terrier Personality and Temperament While every dog is an individual and every Cairn Terrier has distinct personality traits, overall this is an active, intelligent, and highly social breed. They can be good family pets with proper training\u2014and if they have outlets to expend their energy. They make good playmates for children, though interactions between kids and dogs should always be supervised. Cairn Terrier Behavior\u00a0 Because of their hunting origins, Cairn Terriers cannot resist the urge to chase anything and everything\u2014squirrels, cats, rabbits, cars, and other dogs. Always keep your Cairn inside of a fenced-in space or on a leash whenever they\u2019re outside, so they don\u2019t dart off after something that catches their eye. And just in case, make sure your Cairn is microchipped and always wearing an up-to-date ID tag. These dogs also love to dig. So if you leave your Cairn Terrier in the backyard unsupervised, don\u2019t be surprised if they turn your garden into a trench. Cairn Terrier Training Cairn Terriers are a high-energy breed that thrives on attention. They benefit from continuous playtime, regular training, and dog sports such as agility classes. This curious breed is quick to learn, and with positive reinforcement and patience, your Cairn Terrier puppy can pick up on training cues quickly. Fun Activities for Cairn Terriers Agility\u00a0 Fetch\u00a0 Dock diving Hunting Frisbee Digging Long walks\u00a0 Cairn Terrier Grooming Guide  This breed comes in every color except white, and you\u2019ll commonly find silver, cream, gray, and black Cairn Terriers. No matter the color, Cairn Terriers don\u2019t shed much and are relatively low-maintenance. Skin Care Cairn Terriers do not need to be bathed frequently due to their waterproof double coat. But if your pup gets a little smelly, it\u2019s best to use a dog shampoo made for breeds with a hard coat, according to the breed club. Coat Care Though you don\u2019t need to schedule regular trips to the groomer, the CTCA recommends occasional hand-stripping appointments. This is when the hair is removed at the root instead of clipped, and it works to preserve the Cairn Terrier\u2019s coat texture. This alternative to traditional grooming only removes dead hairs (so it\u2019s not as painful as it sounds!), and it\u2019s often done with a FURminator brush. Otherwise, a weekly at-home grooming session with a pin brush will keep your pup\u2019s coat free of mats. Eye Care It\u2019s important to keep the hair around your Cairn Terrier\u2019s eyes trimmed. This helps ensure they can see clearly and keeps their eyes healthy.\u00a0 Ear Care Keeping your dog\u2019s ears clean is essential for preventing debris from accumulating. By cleaning their ears after bath time, you can help prevent ear infections by keeping the ears clean and dry at all times.\u00a0 Considerations for Pet Parents Adding any pet to your life is a big responsibility, and Cairn Terriers are no exception. Before you bring home your Cairn Terrier puppy, know that you will need to dedicate time to training, socialization, mental stimulation, and exercise to have a happy and healthy pup. While this dog can be a great fit for families with kids, they might see other, smaller animals as something to chase."}]
